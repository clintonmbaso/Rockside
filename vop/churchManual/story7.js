                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The solemn obligations of membership in the body of Christ should be 
impressed on everyone desiring Church membership. Only those giving 
evidence of having experienced the new birth and enjoying a spiritual 
experience in the Lord Jesus are prepared for acceptance into membership.
            
Pastors must instruct candidates in the fundamental teachings and related 
practices of the Church so they will enter the Church on a sound spiritual 
basis. While there is no stated age for baptism, it is recommended that very 
young children who express a desire to be baptized should be encouraged and 
entered into an instruction program that may lead to baptism.
            
The apostle Paul writes: “Or do you not know that as many of us as were 
baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were 
buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised 
from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in 
newness of life” (Rom. 6:3, 4).
            
Luke also reports: “Then Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and let every one 
of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.’ . . . Then those who gladly 
received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls 
were added to them” (Acts 2:38-41).
            
“The members of the church, those whom He has called out of darkness 
into His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory. The church is the 
repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church will 
eventually be made manifest, even to ‘the principalities and powers in 
heavenly places,’ the final and full display of the love of God.”—AA 9.

                <h2>Baptism</h2>
                <p>A Prerequisite to Membership—“Christ has made baptism the sign of 
entrance to His spiritual kingdom. He has made this a positive condition with 
which all must comply who wish to be acknowledged as under the authority 
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. . . .
“Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who are 
baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, at 
the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that they have 
forsaken the service of Satan and have become members of the royal family, 
children of the heavenly King. They have obeyed the command: ‘Come out 
from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the unclean thing.’ 
And to them is fulfilled the promise: ‘I will receive you, and will be a Father 
unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.’ 
2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.”—6T 91.
Baptism is the avenue of induction into the Church. It is fundamentally 
the pledge of entrance into Christ’s saving covenant and should be treated as 
a solemn and yet joyful welcome into the family of God.
Membership in the Church is possible only in those churches included in 
the sisterhood of churches recognized by a conference.
Mode of Baptism—The Church believes in baptism by immersion and 
accepts into membership only those who have been baptized in this manner. 
(See Chapter 15, “Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists.”) Those 
who acknowledge their lost state as sinners, sincerely repent of their sins, and 
experience conversion may, after proper instruction, be accepted as 
candidates for baptism and Church membership.
Thorough Instruction and Public Examination Before Baptism—
Candidates individually or in a baptismal class should be instructed from the 
Scriptures regarding the Church’s Fundamental Beliefs and practices and the 
responsibilities of membership. A pastor should satisfy the church by a public 
examination that candidates are well instructed, are committed to taking this 
important step, and by practice and conduct demonstrate a willing acceptance 
of Church doctrines and the principles of conduct which are the outward 
expression of those doctrines, for “by their fruits you will know them” (Matt. 
7:20).
If public examination is impractical, then candidates should be examined 
by the board or a committee appointed by the board, such as the board of 
elders, whose report then should be given to the church before the baptism.
“The test of discipleship is not brought to bear as closely as it should be 
upon those who present themselves for baptism. It should be understood 
whether they are simply taking the name of Seventh-day Adventists, or 
whether they are taking their stand on the Lord’s side, to come out from the 
world and be separate, and touch not the unclean thing. Before baptism there 
should be a thorough inquiry as to the experience of the candidates. Let this 
inquiry be made, not in a cold and distant way, but kindly, tenderly, pointing 
the new converts to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. 
Bring the requirements of the gospel to bear upon the candidates for 
baptism.”—6T 95, 96.

                <h2>Baptismal Vow and Commitment</h2>
                <p>Baptismal Vow—Baptismal candidates and those being received into 
fellowship by profession of faith shall affirm their acceptance of the 
Fundamental Beliefs in the presence of the local congregation or other 
properly appointed body. (See p. 50.)
            
The pastor or elder should address the following questions to the 
candidate(s), whose reply may be by verbal assent, raising the hand, or other 
culturally appropriate method.
            
Vow
1. Do you believe there is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a 
unity of three coeternal Persons?
            
2. Do you accept the death of Jesus Christ on Calvary as the atoning 
sacrifice for your sins and believe that by God’s grace through faith in His 
shed blood you are saved from sin and its penalty?
            
3. Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Savior, 
believing that God, in Christ, has forgiven your sins and given you a new

regularly in prayer and Bible study?
            
6. Do you accept the Ten Commandments as a transcript of the 
character of God and a revelation of His will? Is it your purpose by the power 
of the indwelling Christ to keep this law, including the fourth commandment, 
which requires the observance of the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath 
of the Lord and the memorial of Creation?
            
7. Do you look forward to the soon coming of Jesus and the blessed 
hope, when “this mortal shall . . . put on immortality” [1 Cor. 15:54, KJV]? 
As you prepare to meet the Lord, will you witness to His loving salvation by 
using your talents in personal soul-winning endeavor to help others to be 
ready for His glorious appearing?

worship God and to support the Church through your tithes and offerings and 
by your personal effort and influence?

will you honor God by caring for it, avoiding the use of that which is harmful, 
and abstaining from all unclean foods; from the use, manufacture, or sale of 
alcoholic beverages; from the use, manufacture, or sale of tobacco in any of 
its forms for human consumption; and from the misuse of or trafficking in 
narcotics or other drugs?
            
11. Do you know and understand the fundamental Bible principles as 
taught by the Seventh-day Adventist Church? Do you purpose, by the grace 
of God, to fulfill His will by ordering your life in harmony with these 
principles?
            
12. Do you accept the New Testament teaching of baptism by 
immersion and desire to be so baptized as a public expression of faith in 
Christ and His forgiveness of your sins?
            
13. Do you accept and believe that the Seventh-day Adventist Church is 
the remnant church of Bible prophecy and that people of every nation, race, 
and language are invited and accepted into its fellowship? Do you desire to 
be a member of this local congregation of the world Church?

                <h2>Alternative Vow</h2>
                <p>1. Do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and Lord, and 
do you desire to live your life in a saving relationship with Him?
            
2. Do you accept the teachings of the Bible as expressed in the 
Statement of Fundamental Beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and 
do you pledge by God’s grace to live your life in harmony with these 
teachings?
            
3. Do you desire to be baptized as a public expression of your belief in 
Jesus Christ, to be accepted into the fellowship of the Seventh-day Adventist 
Church, and to support the Church and its mission as a faithful steward by 
your personal influence, tithes and offerings, and a life of service?
            
Baptismal Covenant—The Church has adopted its 28 Fundamental 
Beliefs, together with the baptismal vow and Certificate of Baptism and 
Commitment, as a baptismal covenant.
            
A printed copy of this covenant, with the Certificate of Baptism and
Commitment properly completed, should be given to all accepted into
membership by baptism. An appropriate certificate also should be given those 
accepted on profession of faith.
            
The Certificate of Baptism and Commitment contains a space for the new 
member to sign as an affirmation of commitment. Following the baptism, the 
Certificate of Baptism and Commitment should be presented to the candidate 
as a covenant document. The commitment reads as follows:

Voting Acceptance Subject to Baptism—After the candidates have, 
in the presence of the church membership or other properly appointed body, 
answered the questions of the vow in the affirmative, or assurance has been 
given to the church that they have already done so, the church should vote on 
their acceptance into membership subject to baptism, which should not be 
unduly delayed.
            
Receiving Members Who Are Not Known—In preparing for the 
baptism of converts, an evangelist should invite the pastor or elder to visit the 
baptismal class to become acquainted with the candidates. Such contacts will 
enable the church to be better prepared to receive the new members.
            
Baptismal Preparations—At the baptismal service the deacons 
should make necessary preparations and also assist male candidates into and 
out of the water. The deaconesses should assist female candidates.
            
Care should be exercised to see that proper attire is provided for the 
candidates, preferably robes of suitable heavy material. If robes are not 
available, the candidates should dress in modest attire.
The baptism should be followed by a short welcoming ceremony.

                <h2>Rebaptism</h2>
                <p>Rebaptism is specifically mentioned only in Acts 19:1-7, where the 
apostle Paul endorsed it for a group of believers whose previous baptism of 
repentance had been by John. In addition to repentance, Christian baptism is 
associated with an understanding of and personal commitment to the gospel 
and the teachings of Jesus and a reception of the Holy Spirit. With this 
increased understanding and commitment, rebaptism is acceptable.
Individuals From Other Christian Communions—On biblical 
grounds, individuals from other Christian communions who have embraced 
Seventh- day Adventist beliefs and who have previously been baptized by 
immersion may request rebaptism.
The following examples, however, suggest that rebaptism may not be 
required. Evidently the instance of Acts 19 was a special one, for Apollos is 
reported to have received John’s baptism (Acts 18:25), and there is no record 
that he was rebaptized. Apparently some of the apostles themselves received 
John’s baptism (John 1:35-40), but there is no record they were rebaptized.
If a new believer has accepted significant new truths, Ellen G. White 
supports rebaptism as the Spirit leads the new believer to request it. This 
follows the developmental pattern of Acts 19. An individual who has 
previously experienced baptism by immersion should evaluate his/her new 
religious experience and determine whether he/she desires rebaptism. There 
is to be no urging.
            
“This [rebaptism] is a subject which each individual must 
conscientiously take his position upon in the fear of God. This subject should 
be carefully presented in the spirit of tenderness and love. Then the duty of 
urging belongs to no one but God; give God a chance to work with His Holy 
Spirit upon the minds, so that the individual will be perfectly convinced and 
satisfied in regard to this advanced step.”—Ev 373.
            
Apostasy and Rebaptism—Although apostasy existed in the apostolic 
church (Heb. 6:4-6), Scripture does not address the question of rebaptism. 
Ellen G. White supports rebaptism when members have apostatized and then 
are reconverted and wish to rejoin the Church. (See pp. 72-73, 168.)
“The Lord calls for a decided reformation. And when a soul is truly 
reconverted, let him be rebaptized. Let him renew his covenant with God, and 
God will renew His covenant with him.”—Ev 375.
            
Inappropriate Rebaptism—On the basis of biblical teaching and the 
guidance of Ellen G. White, rebaptism should occur only in special 
circumstances and should be relatively rare. To administer baptism 
repeatedly or on an emotional basis lessens its meaning and represents a 
misunderstanding of the gravity and significance that Scripture assigns to it. 
A member whose spiritual experience has become cold needs a spirit of 
repentance which leads to revival and reformation. This experience will be 
followed by participation in the communion service to signify renewed 
cleansing and fellowship in the body of Christ, making rebaptism 
unnecessary

                <h2>Profession of Faith</h2>
                <p>Individuals who have accepted the Fundamental Beliefs of the 
Seventh-day Adventist Church and who desire membership in the Church on 
profession of faith may be accepted under any of the following four 
circumstances:
1. A committed Christian coming from another Christian communion 
who has already been baptized by immersion as practiced by the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church. (See p. 54.)
2. A member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who, because of 
world conditions, is unable to secure a letter of transfer from his/her home 
church. (See p. 59.)
3. A member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church whose request for 
membership transfer has received no response from the church where he/she 
is a member. In such a case the church shall seek assistance of the conference 
or conferences involved.
4. An individual who has been a member, but whose membership has 
been misplaced or has been withdrawn because he/she was a missing 
member, yet who has remained faithful to his/her Christian commitment.
Great care should be exercised in receiving members if they have 
formerly been members of another congregation. When a person applies for 
membership on profession of faith, inquiries should be made concerning the 
applicant’s former experience. Church officers should seek the advice and 
help of the conference president. Sufficient time should be taken to 
investigate the facts.
When a person applies for membership on profession of faith and it is 
found that he/she still is a member of another congregation, no steps should 
be taken to receive that person into membership until the church holding the 
membership grants a letter of transfer. If, after the process of transfer is
followed (see p. 57-58), a church refuses to grant a letter of transfer and the 
member feels the letter has been unjustly denied, the member may appeal to 
the conference executive committee. Following this procedure will result in 
a higher appreciation of the sacredness of Church membership and in wrongs 
being made right. No church has the right to withhold transfer unless the 
person is under discipline.
When an individual whose membership has been removed seeks 
readmission to church membership, readmission is normally preceded by 
rebaptism. (See pp. 72-73.)

                <h2>Transferring Members</h2>
                <p>When members move to a different area, the clerk of the church holding 
their membership records should write to the secretary of the relevant 
conference requesting that a pastor in the new locality visit them and help 
facilitate their membership transfer to the new congregation.
The clerk of the church holding the membership records also should 
notify the transferring members of the intention to give their new addresses 
to the conference.
Members who move to another locality for longer than six months should 
make immediate applications for letters of transfer. Members moving to an 
isolated area with no church within a reasonable distance should apply to join 
the conference church.
Method of Granting Letters of Transfer—Members should apply for 
their letters of transfer to the clerk of the church with which the members 
desire to unite (the receiving church). That clerk sends the request to the clerk
of the church from which the members desire to transfer (the granting 
church). (For alternative method, see p. 58.)
When the clerk of the granting church receives the request, the clerk 
brings it to the pastor or elder, who in turn presents it to the board. After due 
consideration, the board votes to recommend, favorably or otherwise, to the 
church. (See pp. 37-40, 41, 55-61, 71-73, 87.) The pastor or elder then brings 
the recommendation to the attention of the church for a first reading. Final 
action is taken the following week, when the request is presented to the 
church for a vote.
The purpose of the one-week interval is to give members an opportunity 
to object to the granting of the letter. Objections ordinarily should not be 
publicly stated but be lodged with the pastor or elder, who then refers them 
to the board for consideration. The board should give each objector
opportunity to appear to present his/her objection. If the objection is not based 
on valid grounds, the person raising objection should be admonished to 
withdraw it. If the objection is based on valid grounds, it is the duty of the 
board to investigate. Final action on granting the letter is deferred until the 
matter has been satisfactorily settled.
If the objection involves personal relationships, every effort should be 
made to effect reconciliation. If public offenses are involved, disciplinary 
measures may be called for. If there is some spiritual lapse, efforts should be 
made to restore the member.
Clerk to Prepare Letter—When the church has granted the letter of 
transfer, the clerk fills out the regular transfer form and forwards it to the 
clerk of the receiving church. The clerk of the receiving church then passes 
the letter to the pastor or elder, who presents it first to the board for 
recommendation, after which the request is presented to the church at its next 
regular service. The vote accepting the person into membership usually is 
taken at the regular service one week later. The clerk of the receiving church 
then adds the member’s name and date of admittance to the membership 
record. The clerk also fills out the return portion of the letter of transfer, 
certifying that the member has been accepted, and returns it to the clerk of 
the granting church. (See p. 87.)
Letter Valid Six Months—A letter of transfer is valid for six months 
from date of issue.
Alternative Method for Membership Transfer—A division may 
approve alternative methods for transferring members between churches 
within the division, but when members request transfers to a church in 
another division, the above “Method of Granting Letters of Transfer” must 
be followed.
Membership During Transfer—Under no circumstances shall the 
clerk of the granting church remove a member’s name from the membership 
record until the return portion of the transfer letter has been received, 
certifying that the member has been voted into the fellowship of the receiving 
church. To do so deprives the person of membership during the transfer. The 
clerk, the elders, the pastor, and the conference president are all responsible 
for seeing that all churches adhere to this procedure.
Receiving Members Under Difficult Conditions—World conditions 
sometimes prevent communications concerning a membership transfer. In 
such situations, the receiving church, in counsel with the conference, should 
satisfy itself as to the applicant’s standing and then receive him/her into 
membership on profession of faith. If the way later opens to communicate 
with the granting church or to the conference where it is located, the receiving 
church should send a letter stating what it has done.
Counted in Statistical Reports—When quarterly and annual statistical 
reports are made, a member to whom a letter has been granted, but whose 
return certificate has not been received, is counted as a member of the 
granting church. When the return certificate has been received, the name is 
then removed from the membership record of the granting church and not 
included in subsequent reports.
If Member Is Not Accepted—The receiving church must receive the 
member unless it knows a valid reason it should not extend the privilege of 
membership. If a church does not receive the member, the clerk should return 
the letter to the granting church with a full explanation of the reasons. The 
person’s membership then remains with the granting church, which should 
cooperate with the member to resolve the matter.
Letters Granted Only to Those in Regular Standing—Letters of 
transfer are granted only to members in regular standing, never to a member 
under discipline. Qualifying statements are out of order except when the 
pastor or board of the granting church has factual or proven knowledge that 
the member has been involved as a perpetrator of child abuse. In that case, 
for the safety of children, the pastor or elder should provide a confidential 
statement alerting the pastor or elder of the congregation to which the 
member is transferring.
If a member who has moved to a new location has grown indifferent, the 
pastor or elder of the granting church may, to be clear in the matter before the 
transfer is granted, take up the question with the pastor or elder of the 
receiving church.
No Letter Without Member’s Approval—In no case should a church 
vote a letter of transfer contrary to the desire of the member, nor should a 
church accept a member by a letter granted under such circumstances. 
Membership is the personal relationship of an individual to the body of 
Christ, and a church should recognize this relationship and avoid any action 
that might be construed as arbitrary.
On the other hand, a member is under obligation to recognize the welfare 
of the church and to make every effort to relieve the church of problems 
incident to absentee members. When a member moves, he/she should 
promptly request a letter of transfer.
When a church is expelled from the sisterhood of churches by action of 
a conference session, the memberships of all loyal members, except those 
who refuse, are considered moved to the conference church on a provisional 
basis. The conference church then may issue letters of transfer for loyal 
members and deal with other memberships as may be necessary. (See pp. 40-
43.)
Church Board Cannot Grant Letters—A board has no authority to 
vote letters of transfer or to receive members by letter. The board’s authority 
is limited to making recommendations to the church. Action on all transfers 
of membership, favorable or otherwise, must be taken by the church. (See pp. 
57-58.) The clerk has no authority to remove names from or add names to the 
membership record except by vote of the church, unless a member requests 
in writing to be removed from church membership, in which case the church 
board must act on the request. The church may be informed of the member’s 
request, but no discussion will take place. Efforts should be made to restore 
the individual to the church family. When a member dies, the clerk records 
the date of death in the membership record, and no action by the church is 
necessary.
Membership in the Conference Church—Isolated members should 
unite with the conference church, which is a body organized for the benefit 
of believers who otherwise would be without church privileges. Aged and 
infirmed members who live near a church and conference officers and other 
employees, including pastors, should be members of a local church, not the 
conference church.
            
The conference president is the presiding elder of the conference church, 
and the work normally carried by the clerk and the treasurer is handled by the 
conference secretary and treasurer. Since the church has no board, all 
business normally conducted by a local church board is conducted by the 
conference executive committee, which also appoints delegates from the 
conference church to the conference session.
            
Membership Record—The church should have one current, regularly 
updated membership record. Names are added or removed only on the vote 
of the church, at death, or at the member’s request. (See p. 87.)
Redemptive Membership Review—Membership records are kept up 
to date by the local church. They are subject to review by the next higher 
organization. This rule, which also applies to every entity or level of the
