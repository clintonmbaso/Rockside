Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
Evry soul a warning give;
Whosoever hears the message 
May repent, and turn, and live. 

CHORUS
Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,
Blow it loud o’er land and sea…….
(loud o’er land and sea)
God commissions, sound the message!
Ev’ry captive may be free. 

Sound it loud o’er ev’ry hilltop,
Gloomy shade, and sunny plain;
Ocean depths repeat the message,
full salvation’s glad refrain. 

Sound it in the hedge and highway,
Earth’s dark sports where exiles roam;
Let it tell all things are ready, 
Father waits to welcome home. 

Sound it for the heavy laden,
Weary, longing to be free.
Sound a Saviour’s invitation,
Sweetly saying, “Come to me”.

He is coming, He is coming 
He is even at the door. 

The signs that show his coming near,
Are fast fulfilling year by year,
And soon we’ll hail the glorious dawn
Of heaven’s eternal morn. 

Look not on earth for strife to cease,
Look not below for joy and peace,
Until the Saviour comes again,
To banish death and sin. 

Then in that glorious earth made new,
We’ll dwell the countless ages thro’;
This mortal shall immortal be,
And time eternity.

What rejoicing in His in His presence, 
When Are banished grief and pain,
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain.

Face to face to see and know;
Face to face with my redeemer,

How far from home? I asked as on
I bent my steps the watchman spake:-
“The long, dark night is al-most over,
The morning soon will break.
Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,
With hope’s bright star thy guiding ray,
Till thou shall reach the realms of light,
In ev-erlast-ing day.” 

I asked the war-rior on the field:
This was his soul-inspring song:
With courage, bold, the sword I’ll wield,
The bat-tle is not long.
Then weep no more, but well en-dure 
The con-flict, till thy work is done;
For this we know, the prize is sure,
When vic-to-ry is won. 

I asked a-gain; earth, sea and sun
Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:
“Time’s wasting sands are near-ly run,
E-ter-ni-ty is nigh.
Then weep no more-with warning tones
Portentious signs are thick’ning round,
The whole cre-a-tion, wait-ing, groans, 
To hear the trumpet sound.” 

Not far from home! O blessed thought!
The trav’ler’s lonely heart to cheer;
With oft a heal-ing balm has brought,
And dried the mourner’s tear.
Then weep no more, since we shall meet 
Where weary footsteps never roam-
Our tri-als past our joys complete,
Safe in our Father’s home.

Till all the ransomed church of God, Are saved to sin no more 
Are saved to sin no more, Are saved to sin no more 
Till all the ransomed church of God, Are saved to sin no more.

E'er since by faith I saw the stream, Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die;
And shall be till I die, And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love shall be my theme, And shall be till I die.

For me a blood-bought, free reward, A golden harp for me!
A golden harp for me! A golden harp for me!
For me a blood-bought, free reward, A golden harp for me!

There in a nobler, sweeter song, I’ll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue, Is ransomed from the grave,

Take time to be holy, the world rushes on; 
Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone;
By looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be; 
Thy friends in thy conduct, His likeness shall see. 

Take time to be holy, let Him be thy guide,
And run not before him, whatever betide; 
In joy or in sorrow, still follow thy Lord,
And looking to Jesus, still trust in his word. 

Take time to be holy, be calm in thy soul,
Each tho't and each motive beneath his control; 
Thus led by the Spirit to fountains of love,
Thou soon shall be fitted for service above.

Be it by water or by fire, O make me clean, O make me clean 

CHORUS
So wash me Thou-------- without, within,
(Wash me, Thou, without, within)
Or purge with fire, --------- If that must be,
(Or purge with fire, If that must be)
No matter how, ---------- if only sin.
(Any how if only sin)
Die out in me, die out in me. (die out in me) 

If clearer visions Thou impart, Grateful and glad my soul shall be,
But yet to have a purer heart, Is more to me, Is more to me. 

Yes, only as this heart is clean, May larger vision yet be mine,
For mirrored in Thy life are seen, The things divine, The things divine

I watch to shun the miry way, And snatch the springs of guilty thot’, 
But watch and struggle as I may, Pure I am not, Pure I am not.

I’ve wandered far away o’er mountains cold, 
I’ve wandered far away from home;
O take me now, 
And bring me to Thy fold, Come, 
Great Deliverer, come. 

I have no place, no shelter from the night,
Come, Great Deliverer, come; 
One look from Thee would give life and light,
Come, Great Deliverer, come. 

My path is lone, and weary are my feet, 
Come Great Deliverer, come;
Mine eyes look up Thy loving smile to meet, 
Come, Great Deliverer, come. 

Thou wilt not spurn contrition’s broken sigh,
Come, Great Deliverer, come.
Regard my prayer, and hear my humble cry,
Come, Great Deliverer, come.

Able to deliver! Sound it far and near;
Able to deliver whosoe’er will hear; 
From the fiery furnace, from the sinner’s doom,
Jesus will deliver whosoe’er will Come. 

CHORUS
Able to deliver, Able to save,
When you are, my brother 
Able to believe. 

Able to deliver! Can it really be?
Is there any power can deliver me? 
Tell me, tell me truly, is the Christ once slain,
Able to deliver me from Satan’s Chain? 

Able to deliver! Courage, trembling one!
Are you serving Jesus? He will save his own;
Fear not Satan’s power, cling to Jesus’ hand, 
Cease your fear and doubting,
boldly for him stand.

We’ll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,
On Christ, the mighty Rock. 

Some build on the sinking sands of life,
On visions of earthly treasure;
Some build on the waves of sin and strife,
Of fame, and worldly pleasure. 

O build on the Rock, for ever sure,
The firm and the true foundation;
Its hope is the hope which shall endure,
The hope of salvation.

While toiling here below!
It buoys us up while passing through,
This wilderness of woe;

It points to us a land of rest,
Where saints with Christ will reign;
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
And never part again,
Where we shall meet the loved of earth, 
And never part again. 

A land where sin can never come,
Temptations ne’er annoy;
Where happiness will ever dwell,
And that without alloy;
Where happiness will ever dwell,
And that without alloy. 

In that bright world no tears will flow,
Death ne’er can enter there;
For all who gain that heavenly land,
will be as angels are;
For all who gain the heavenly land,
Will be as angels are. 

Fly, ling’ring moments, fly, O fly,
Dear Saviour, quickly come!
We long to see thee as thou art,
And reach that blissful home;
We long to see thee as thou art,
And reach that blissful home.

There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
To gather His loved ones home.

Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus,
When the cares of life upon you roll,
He will heal the wounded heart,
He will strength and grace impart;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus. 

CHORUS
The best friend to have is Jesus,
(Jesus every day)
The best friend to have is Jesus 
(Jesus all the way) 
He will help you when you fall,
He will hear you when you call;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus. 

What a friend I have found in Jesus!
Peace and comfort to my soul He brings; 
Leaning on His mighty arm, I will fear no ill nor harm;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus. 

Though I pass through the night of sorrow,
And the chilly waves of Jordan roll,
Never need I shrink nor fear, For my Saviour is so near;
Oh the best friend to have is Jesus. 

When at last to our home we gather,
With the faithful who have gone before, 
We will sing upon the shore, Praising Him forevermore;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.

To God be the glory, great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son;
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin, 
And opened the Life-gate that all may go in.

CHORUS
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice,
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him The glory, great things He hath done.

O perfect redemption the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing thro’ Jesus the Son; 
But purer, and higher, and greater will be,
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.

Casting down their bright crowns around the glassy sea;
Thousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee,
Which wert and art and evermore shalt be 

Holy, holy, holy! Though darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of man Thy great glory may not see
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power, in love and purity.

Up to the heavenly courts above;
Two little eyes to read the Bible, 
Telling of Jesus’ wondrous love. 

I’ve one little heart to give to Jesus,
One little soul for him to save;
One little life for His dear service,
One little self that he must have.

Waiting, waiting, wondrous fair;
But the door is hard to open,
For the weeds and ivy vine,
With their dark and clinging tendrils,
Ever round the hinges twine,
Ever round the hinges twine. 

Knocking, knocking, what! Still there?
Waiting, waiting, grand and fair; 
Yes, the wounded hand still knocketh, 
And beneath the thorn-wreath’d hair, 
Beam the patient eyes, so tender, 
Of thy Saviour waiting there; 
Wilt thou keep him waiting there?

Safe from the law that now judgeth me!

Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;
“Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,
Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.” 

Reconciled by His death for my sin, 
Justified by His life pure and clean, 
Sanctified by obeying His word,
Glorified when returneth my soul.

While He cleanses my heart of its dross, 
But “there’s no condemnation;” I know I am free,
For my sins are all nailed to the cross. 

I will cling to my Saviour and never depart,
I will joyfully journey each day,
With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
That my sins have been taken away.
