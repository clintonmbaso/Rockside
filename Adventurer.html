That program is intended for children four years old, with the Little Fish program for children five years old. Children should not start this class before they have passed their fourth birthday.<br>
The NAD manual can be used if you wish to order them from Advent Source (see below). However the cost is fairly high especially when freight is added. The manuals are very colourful with lots of helpful information but they are NOT NECESSARY to run the course. Also it must be remembered that the requirements in this manual are NOT the same as those in the NAD manual. Almost all the material here is taken from that manual, but in most cases it is shortened and there are general articles of helps for leaders and teachers that are omitted here.<br>

However, they have been listed as they are in the NAD manual. It may be that some of the Stars would be best done on a Sunday.<br>

Send them to the Youth Department at the Conference to tamasianoerianto@adventist.org.au or to Norman Tew (normtew@tech2u.com.au). If you have any activities, crafts or stories that would help in any of the requirements of this course please send these also. We have no plans to change this manual but extra teaching helps can always be added to those already on the web site. Thank you.<br>

Though the NAD uses a different wording for the Little Lamb Pledge, we will be using the Adventurer pledge for pre-Adventurers also.<br>
Note that the pledge as used in the South Pacific Division includes the word “can” not “will” as is used in some other areas of the world.<br>

The Little Lamb stars can be sewn on the bottom section of the front of the sash. The Little Fish diamonds can go on the next section of the sash and the Adventurer awards on the top of the sash.<br>
Sashes are being sold by the Mountain View club (currently the price is A$8.00), but these can also be purchased at Girl Guide stores as their colour matches ours. It is recommended that a piece of velcro be sewn under the sash where it crosses the right shoulder, with the matching piece of velcro on the shoulder of the uniform shirt. This will stop the sash from slipping off, as it will do so for small children!<br>
If it is desired to use the Little Lamb Puzzle patch this could be sewn onto the scarf where the Adventurer logo is normally placed. However, this is optional, we are not recommending this. <br>

Gather the pre-Adventurers into a circle. (This can be done by having the children hold hands. Move backwards slowly until the circle is formed). Discuss what new things they learned this week, or ask questions about what they enjoyed best etc.<br>
Close with a very short prayer. <br>

Thus the use of work books is not compulsory. The use of a display book to store materials produced and/or pictures of activities is a good idea. Use active learning methods.<br>

Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft, one activity, and one discussion on the topic that the children have learnt about Jesus <br>
• Prepare a sheet or blanket tent<br>
Bring oversized T-shirts and head scarves so the children can dress up as in Bible times. Encourage the children to take off their shoes and socks, and pretend to cook, or watch their sheep etc. Or just do dress up letting the children try different ideas, and let them suggest the kinds of toys Jesus might have played with (hint - his father was a carpenter so there would have been wood scraps).<br>
• Play Simon Sa</span><span style="color:#000000;">ys using the term the Shepherd ins</span><span style="color:#231F20;">tead of Simon<br>
Draw an outline of a lamb, and prepare pictures of shepherds. Let the children glue cotton wool onto the lamb picture. While they are working or in a de-brief afterward discuss how a shepherd deals with a lost lamb and how Jesus deals with us when we wander from the way he wants us to go.<br>
• With paddlepop sticks and white glue let the children build flat topped Bible land houses. <br>
Talk about the fact that Jesus was a carpenter.<br>
This is an Iranian game that can be played sitting in a circle, and could easily be the type of game that Jesus played with his friends. The children sit in a circle with a leader. The leader does an action and the children take turns round the circle copying the action (pull a face, tug on ear or nose, stroke the hair of the person next to you, etc). In the original game anyone who laughed or made a giggle or a noise was out, but let the children stay in though trying to exercise self-control.<br>

Thunder, drum sticks on a chair. Brook (a bottle with some water, then blow into it with a straw. Varying the level of the water varies the sound). Record and play back the children making lambs bleating, lions roaring, wind blowing etc.<br>
On a large piece of paper draw round the bare feet of the children. Show them how to change these outlines into fishes.<br>

Scrape the rocks with a nail to see the different hardness of rocks. Weigh rocks of the same size but different densities on scales. If you can find some lava (pumice), drop it into water and show that some rocks float. Have cardboard boxes with different sized holes cut in the top. Let the children sort the rocks by size using the different sized holes.<br>

Bible stories could be of Adam &amp; Eve, with Cain &amp; Abel; Noah’s family; Joseph or David and their brothers. A story of a modern family would be just as good. Remember modern families do not all have mothers and fathers, so include grandparents, uncles, aunts, siblings etc. Remind the children that we are all part of the family of Jesus.<br>

There are all kinds of families I see, Some are two and some are three (hold up two then three fingers) Some are eight and some are four (change the number of fingers showing) And some are more and more and more! (Raise and lower all 10 fingers.)<br>
Do four activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and one activity, plus one discussion on the things the children have learnt about families. Here are three suggestions.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Play house. <br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Family Tree. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Draw an outline of a tree with large leaves. Each child will need to go to an adult to place names of the people in their family on their tree. Make sure the child’s name is on one of the leaves. (Nanna, Mummy, Daddy are suitable names, you do not have to use first names etc).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Family matching. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Find pictures of parents, grand-parents, children etc (two of each!). On index cards, make 16 to 20 cards in a pack with 8 to 10 pairs of pictures. Have an adult with two to three children, to supervise playing game and discuss about families. Spread cards out face down, turn up two cards, if they match the child keeps them. As the child takes a matching pair ask what family member would this be (mother, sister etc). The NAD manual suggests www.gettyimages.com but going to Google, and selecting images, the father, mother, boy girl etc may be quicker.<br>

• You will need big sheets of white paper, plus oddments of crayons, buttons, scraps and paste. First have each child lie on the big sheet and draw round them (they do not have to lie out flat). Then let them decorate the outline of themselves, with colours, scraps etc. (NB - Observe what, how &amp; where the decorations go)<br>
• Name game, stand in a circle, name a child and bounce the ball to them, they return it. Make sure to give each child a turn and name them.<br>
• Make a sheet of paper for each child with their name outlined in dots. Let them trace in the name and decorate the paper with colours, glitter etc.<br>
• Paper bag puppets. You will need crayons, paper bags, hair coloured pieces of wool (long and short), and some buttons. Show one you have made then let the children glue on the hair with buttons for eyes, draw in mouth, nose etc. They do not have to use their own hair colouring.<br>
• Unique Me. Weigh each child and measure their height. Have them blow into a balloon to see how big they can go on one breath. Take a finger print and let them look at it through a magnifying glass. Taste samples of fruits and vegetables and record which they liked best. Record their voices (in advance) and let the group guess the names of the voices.<br>
• I can be . . . Collect pictures of firemen, nurses, police, chefs, artists, builders, veterinarians, etc, etc. together with symbolic clothes for each. Let the children choose and dress up.<br>

• A suggestion that would suit the story of Noah would be to have each child chose a colour of paint to place on their hand. Then each child places their colour on their own and everyone else in their group’s piece of paper, to make rainbows.<br>
• Three legged obstacle course. Beware some small children will not have enough coordination to work with another child and will need to be paired with an adult. Lay out a route around obstacles in the room and have them co-operate as friends to get around the course.<br>
• Song - The Farmer in the Dell. See http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/farmer.htm for the words and music (there is a lot of other useful material on the kids section of this site).<br>
• Everyone forms a circle with one adult in the middle, each time the song is sung the last person to go to the middle calls another person by name to join them until all the children are in the middle.<br>
• Song - If you’re happy and you know it. Adapt the words of the song at </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/happand.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"> , use the word “friendly” instead of happy, and some of the actions can</span><span style="color:#000000;"> be modified to types of greetings. Song - Jesus is a Friend of Mine (action point to self) and for the last line sing “And He is -----&gt;s friend too using the name of another child.

The centres could be salty (nuts or popcorn), sweet (honey, suga<span style="color:#000000;">r), sour (lemon), bitter (broccoli, celery). Then have extra bowls with vanilla, vinegar, orange juice, cinnamon and ginger. In another area have foods with various textures (spaghetti, jelly, dry oatmeal, peeled grapes. Explain that senses help us to find things we like or do not like. Let them visit the various centres (tab</span><span style="color:#231F20;"/>les) and experience the differences of each food. Have adult supervision at each table.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Fruit and Veggie stamped place mats. Before class cut fruit and vegetables in halves and make “stamps”. Apples have a star design in the middle, green peppers make a fun shamrock shape. Prepare paint containers. Protect work area with newspapers or plastic. Tell the children they are going to make place mats to remind them to eat fruit and vegetables, make sure they understand what place mats are. Use different stamps to put designs all over each place mat. After the paint has dried the mats may be laminated.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Fun with Foods. Divide the children into teams, with a starting line and a chair some distance from the line. The children are to be creative in taking the food to the chair. This is not a race, but a display of creativity, encourage teams to cheer each other. An orange can be pushed along the floor with the nose, an (hard boiled) egg can go on a spoon, a round fruit can be carried on a flat board etc, etc.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Fruit Kebabs. You will need sticks and lots of bright fruit pieces, especially those with a good scent. Let the children make up kebab sticks then eat from them. (Watch the point of the stick and direct the Pre-Adventurers). In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, let the children tell you what they have learnt about healthy food to eat.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Ways I can Help. Collect stickers or pictures of ways children can help with cleaning activities. Stick the pictures on a page or poster (combined work with several children) and let the children complete the work with crayons etc.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Watch Me Help. Break the children into very small groups to do some or all of the following activities. A) Washing and drying dishes with a tub of water. B) Sweeping - make a spill of beans, macaroni of popcorn to be swept up. C) Gardening, plant some sunflowers or other big seeds in some semi-prepared soil. D) Cooking using mixing bowls and wooden spoons to mix beans, dried pasta, oats and raisins. (OH&amp;S be aware of prepared pot-mix).</span><br>

The children can thread thick wool (or coloured string) through. You may be able to avoid a needle by waxing the end of the string or wool to make its own point. Roll sticky tape tightly around the end of the wool/string also makes it easy to thread.</span><br>

Read a story of the early Polynesians and how they used stars to cross the Pacific or tell the story of the Wise Men who found Jesus by following a special star.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:15px;"><span style="color:#2F5496;"/>ACTIVITIES</span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Follow the star. Have a big cardboard star that you can hold up. Have the children follow you around the hall or around an “obstacle” course, copying the way you skip, hop, walk, crawl etc.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Make a lot of stars of different materials and sizes. Have a series of boxes with a star of each size marked on each box. Have the children sort the stars by size into the boxes.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Sparkling stars. Have enough star shaped stencils (purchase or make your own) one for each child. Let them fill the area in the stencil shape with glitter glue, then sprinkle on the glitter. Repeat all over the paper provided to each child, so they have lots of glitter stars of different colours.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Night Sky. You will need Styrofoam cups, torches, and ball point pens to make holes in the base of the cups. Let each child make a couple of holes in the base of their cup. Make the room dark, then let the children make a night sky on the ceiling by using the torches inside the cups. A low ceiling would be best, some spare cups will be needed for the children who make holes that are too big.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">Make a rain gauge by cutting off the top of the bottle to a point where it has straight sides, then glue a cheap ruler inside to measure the water collected. Let the children take the rain gauges home and place them in their gardens where there’s an open space. Read the raingauge after some rain.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Hot and cold. Make 20 red circles (20 cm diameter) and 20 blue circles and 5 yellow ones. Have a picture of a hot day and one of a cold day. Place the circles in rows of five with the yellows in the middle and the reds to one side and blues to the other, Place the picture of the hot day on the red side and the cold day on the blue side. In a tray or envelope have weather pictures (sun, clouds, rain etc). Let five children start, one standing on each of the yellow circles. In turn they take a picture at random, or from the top of a stack. If it is a weather picture that makes people warmer they move one row in the red direction, if colder they move one row to the blue side. As each child reaches either the hot or cold picture another child can go to the yellow row and start.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Wind Art. Mix three paint colours to a milky consistency. Each child needs a piece of paper and a straw. An adult puts a drop of paint on the paper for the child, and the child blows through the straw to spread the paint. Extra drops of colour are added as the child works.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Have two sizes of paper plates, some pompoms (or cotton wool balls), craft glue, and black wool. You are going to make parent and baby sheep, by dipping the balls in the glue and covering the sheep with wool. Try to let everyone make at least one large and one small sheep.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Lamb puppets. The simplest puppet would be to stick the outline on the left on a craft stick, though fancier ones can be made, or the plate lambs might be used. Let the puppets act out a play. The NAD manual suggest the story Mary had a Little Lamb, but the story of the lost sheep, or a story about David and his lambs would be more appropriate. Adults will need to guide with this.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Sheep to Shirts. Enlarge the picture onto the next page and give one copy to each child.

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Baby Animal charades. Have some toy animals in a bag. Let each child takes a turn to secretly take a toy from the bag, then come back and act as that baby animal until the others guess what they are. Alternatively if a child is too shy let the whole group act out the animal.</span><br>

The instructions are to cut out this outline in the middle of a paper plate and use it as a stencil (use small sponges to transfer the paint). Several flamingos can go on each piece of paper. Tell the children about flamingos and how they eat and where they live.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Animal Actions. Collect pictures of as many animals as you can. Show them to the children one at a time and have the children imitate them.</span><br>

Buy or make lion masks (to make a mask take a paper plate, colour it yellow, draw on a cat face with cut out eyes, glue yarn round the edges for a mane. Fix a string via holes on each side to hold it to the face). Find pictures of the dens of big cats, and make with boxes, trees and imagination. Let the children pretend they are big cats at home.</span><br>

While it would be nice if each child were able to “make up” any items they missed this will minimise problems.</span><br>

Items to be covered at home should be vouched for separately. There are now two ways of recording for the Little Lambs class.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">Little Lambs Class Record Card is now available for the Pre-Adventurer class. This is signed of by the class teacher as soon as the Little Lambs have completed the requirements. The card is designed so that a record can be kept of the Diamonds that the Little Lambs completes.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">The Work and Attendance Record Sheets. Write the names of the Little Lambs and the dates for the meetings.The work record could then be kept for each group to make sure that each group covers the necessary requirements.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">On the next page is a form that can be copied and used for an attendance record sheet, and on the following page is a form that can be used to record what work was done at each meeting. The forms on the next two pages should be printed in landscape format.</span><br>

• A suggestion that would suit the story of Noah would be to have each child chose a colour of paint to place on their hand. Then each child places their colour on their own and everyone else in their group’s piece of paper, to make rainbows.<br>
• Three legged obstacle course. Beware some small children will not have enough coordination to work with another child and will need to be paired with an adult. Lay out a route around obstacles in the room and have them co-operate as friends to get around the course.<br>
• Song - The Farmer in the Dell. See http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/farmer.htm for the words and music (there is a lot of other useful material on the kids section of this site).<br>
• Everyone forms a circle with one adult in the middle, each time the song is sung the last person to go to the middle calls another person by name to join them until all the children are in the middle.<br>
• Song - If you’re happy and you know it. Adapt the words of the song at </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/happand.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"> , use the word “friendly” instead of happy, and some of the actions can</span><span style="color:#000000;"> be modified to types of greetings. Song - Jesus is a Friend of Mine (action point to self) and for the last line sing “And He is -----&gt;s friend too using the name of another child. Use the music for Mary </span><span style="color:#231F20;">had a little lamb - </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/mary.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"><br>

For the story you and the Pre-Adventurers could go through the alphabet and find a food for each letter, let the children try to tell you also. A few examples would also help. eg. Z for Zucchini.</span><br>

The centres could be salty (nuts or popcorn), sweet (honey, suga<span style="color:#000000;">r), sour (lemon), bitter (broccoli, celery). Then have extra bowls with vanilla, vinegar, orange juice, cinnamon and ginger. In another area have foods with various textures (spaghetti, jelly, dry oatmeal, peeled grapes. Explain that senses help us to find things we like or do not like. Let them visit the various centres (tab</span><span style="color:#231F20;"/>les) and experience the differences of each food. Have adult supervision at each table.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Fruit and Veggie stamped place mats. Before class cut fruit and vegetables in halves and make “stamps”. Apples have a star design in the middle, green peppers make a fun shamrock shape. Prepare paint containers. Protect work area with newspapers or plastic. Tell the children they are going to make place mats to remind them to eat fruit and vegetables, make sure they understand what place mats are. Use different stamps to put designs all over each place mat. After the paint has dried the mats may be laminated.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Fun with Foods. Divide the children into teams, with a starting line and a chair some distance from the line. The children are to be creative in taking the food to the chair. This is not a race, but a display of creativity, encourage teams to cheer each other. An orange can be pushed along the floor with the nose, an (hard boiled) egg can go on a spoon, a round fruit can be carried on a flat board etc, etc.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Fruit Kebabs. You will need sticks and lots of bright fruit pieces, especially those with a good scent. Let the children make up kebab sticks then eat from them. (Watch the point of the stick and direct the Pre-Adventurers). In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, let the children tell you what they have learnt about healthy food to eat.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Bugs in a bottle. Put some soil, some leaves, and some water or sugar water in a bottle and capture a few insects for the children to study. With a magnifying glass. Discuss their food and life style.&nbsp; At the end go outside and release the insects.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Caterpillar wiggles. Bring in a caterpillar. If unable to, bring some pictures of caterpillars. Have the children lie on one side of the room on their stomachs with their arms at their sides and their legs out straight. Ask them to wiggle their way across the room.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Bug art. Get some smooth rocks from a river bed, or store. Have the children paint them as bugs. Some stick-on eyes would be useful.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Ants on a log. (This does not fit the requirements but is fun). Check for food allergies first. Cut celery sticks, with wooden craft sticks spread peanut butter, cream cheese etc in the celery stick (the log). Place raisins on the log (the ants). Eat it all up!</span><br>

Start with the children hopping in time to the beat. As they get the idea speed it up, then vary the beat. Try other movements, such as throwing something light up, tossing bean bags, or clapping paper plates together etc.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Making Instruments. Options </span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Sounds around. Using a tape recorder, record sounds, wind, rain, water running, animal noises, even the children arriving, chimes, car horns, footsteps. If you have head phones allow the children to take turns in identify the sounds. Alternately play each sound separately for the group and have individuals take turns at guessing what the sound is.</span><br>

Ask what is cleaned with each item. Find a story about cleaning in the house, perhaps one about a child keeping (or not keeping) their own room tidy.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• This is the way we . . . Have a box of props for each child, then sing to the tune of Here we go round the mulberry bush (see http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/mulberry.htm) Not all the verses there are suitable but sweep the floor, pick up toys, dust the house, wash the car and you can invent others.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Ways I can Help. Collect stickers or pictures of ways children can help with cleaning activities. Stick the pictures on a page or poster (combined work with several children) and let the children complete the work with crayons etc.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Watch Me Help. Break the children into very small groups to do some or all of the following activities. A) Washing and drying dishes with a tub of water. B) Sweeping - make a spill of beans, macaroni of popcorn to be swept up. C) Gardening, plant some sunflowers or other big seeds in some semi-prepared soil. D) Cooking using mixing bowls and wooden spoons to mix beans, dried pasta, oats and raisins. (OH&amp;S be aware of prepared pot-mix).</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Sewing Fun. Using very stiff card or thin plywood, outline the edge of a picture with holes. The children can thread thick wool (or coloured string) through. You may be able to avoid a needle by waxing the end of the string or wool to make its own point. Roll sticky tape tightly around the end of the wool/string also makes it easy to thread.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">Remember that the fifth requirement has to be done at home for a week. In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, discuss helping at home.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Make a lot of stars of different materials and sizes. Have a series of boxes with a star of each size marked on each box. Have the children sort the stars by size into the boxes.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Sparkling stars. Have enough star shaped stencils (purchase or make your own) one for each child. Let them fill the area in the stencil shape with glitter glue, then sprinkle on the glitter. Repeat all over the paper provided to each child, so they have lots of glitter stars of different colours.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Night Sky. You will need Styrofoam cups, torches, and ball point pens to make holes in the base of the cups. Let each child make a couple of holes in the base of their cup. Make the room dark, then let the children make a night sky on the ceiling by using the torches inside the cups. A low ceiling would be best, some spare cups will be needed for the children who make holes that are too big.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">Make a rain gauge by cutting off the top of the bottle to a point where it has straight sides, then glue a cheap ruler inside to measure the water collected. Let the children take the rain gauges home and place them in their gardens where there’s an open space. Read the raingauge after some rain.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Hot and cold. Make 20 red circles (20 cm diameter) and 20 blue circles and 5 yellow ones. Have a picture of a hot day and one of a cold day. Place the circles in rows of five with the yellows in the middle and the reds to one side and blues to the other, Place the picture of the hot day on the red side and the cold day on the blue side. In a tray or envelope have weather pictures (sun, clouds, rain etc). Let five children start, one standing on each of the yellow circles. In turn they take a picture at random, or from the top of a stack. If it is a weather picture that makes people warmer they move one row in the red direction, if colder they move one row to the blue side. As each child reaches either the hot or cold picture another child can go to the yellow row and start.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">• Wind Art. Mix three paint colours to a milky consistency. Each child needs a piece of paper and a straw. An adult puts a drop of paint on the paper for the child, and the child blows through the straw to spread the paint. Extra drops of colour are added as the child works.</span><br>

The simplest puppet would be to stick the outline on the left on a craft stick, though fancier ones can be made, or the plate lambs might be used. Let the puppets act out a play. The NAD manual suggest the story Mary had a Little Lamb, but the story of the lost sheep, or a story about David and his lambs would be more appropriate. Adults will need to guide with this.</span><br>

Let each child takes a turn to secretly take a toy from the bag, then come back and act as that baby animal until the others guess what they are. Alternatively if a child is too shy let the whole group act out the animal.</span><br>

Buy or make lion masks (to make a mask take a paper plate, colour it yellow, draw on a cat face with cut out eyes, glue yarn round the edges for a mane. Fix a string via holes on each side to hold it to the face). Find pictures of the dens of big cats, and make with boxes, trees and imagination. Let the children pretend they are big cats at home.</span><br>

While it would be nice if each child were able to “make up” any items they missed this will minimise problems.</span><br>
                                                   <span style="line-height:24px;">The class group of which the child is a member, must cover the material; each child must have an 80% attendance record. Items to be covered at home should be vouched for separately. There are now two ways of recording for the Little Lambs class.</span><br>

This is signed of by the class teacher as soon as the Little Lambs have completed the requirements. The card is designed so that a record can be kept of the Diamonds that the Little Lambs completes.</span><br>

Write the names of the Little Lambs and the dates for the meetings.The work record could then be kept for each group to make sure that each group covers the necessary requirements.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. <br>
                                                      <br>
5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. <br>
                                                      <br>
9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. <br>
                                                      <br>
12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. <br>
                                                      <br>
14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. <br>
                                                      <br>
17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. <br>
                                                      <br>
21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. <br>

30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. <br>
                                                      <br>
31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. <br>
                                                      <br>
8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. <br>
                                                      <br>
14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. <br>
                                                      <br>
16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: <br>
                                                      <br>
17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. <br>
                                                      <br>
18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. <br>
                                                      <br>
19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. <br>
                                                      <br>
21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? <br>
                                                      <br>
2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:<br>
                                                      <br>
3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<br>
                                                      <br>
5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <br>
                                                      <br>
8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. <br>
                                                      <br>
9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. <br>
                                                      <br>
17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;<br>
                                                      <br>
18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; <br>
                                                      <br>
19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. <br>
                                                      <br>
21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<br>
                                                      <br>
23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <br>
                                                      <br>
3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: <br>
                                                      <br>
5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?<br>
                                                      <br>
7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. <br>
                                                      <br>
8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. <br>
                                                      <br>
11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;<br>
                                                      <br>
12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. <br>
                                                      <br>
14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. <br>
                                                      <br>
18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. <br>

19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.<br>

25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. <br>
                                                      <br>
26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</span><br>

2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.<br>

5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. <br>
                                                      <br>

12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>

15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.<br>

4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. <br>

13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;<br>
                                                      <br>
14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:<br>
                                                      <br>
22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;<br>
                                                      <br>
9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. <br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,<br>
                                                      <br>
16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:<br>
                                                      <br>
19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. <br>
                                                      <br>
22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:<br>
                                                      <br>
13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      <br>
16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. <br>
                                                      <br>
19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. <br>
                                                      <br>
27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. <br>

                                                      <br>
10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. <br>
                                                      <br>
11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, <br>
                                                      <br>
12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, <br>
                                                      <br>
16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. <br>
                                                      <br>
25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. <br>
                                                      <br>
26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,<br>
                                                      <br>
29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.<br>
                                                      <br>
30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. <br>
                                                      <br>
2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. <br>
                                                      <br>
3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      <br>
15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: <br>
                                                      <br>
17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: <br>
                                                      <br>
21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: <br>
                                                      <br>
25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.<br>
                                                      <br>
29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.<br>
                                                      <br>
30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. <br>
                                                      <br>
10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:<br>
                                                      <br>
12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?<br>
                                                      <br>
19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;<br>
                                                      <br>
4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. <br>
                                                      <br>
9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:<br>
                                                      <br>
15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;<br>
                                                      <br>
9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. <br>
                                                      <br>
14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. <br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,<br>
                                                      <br>
23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:<br>
                                                      <br>
24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. <br>
                                                      <br>
18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      <br>
20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,<br>
                                                      <br>

2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. <br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. <br>
                                                      <br>
12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?<br>
                                                      <br>
14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. <br>
                                                      <br>
2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,<br>
                                                      <br>
4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. <br>
                                                      <br>
5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. <br>
                                                      <br>
9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. <br>
                                                      <br>
13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. <br>
                                                      <br>
16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her. <br>
                                                      <br>
17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; <br>
                                                      <br>
2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:<br>
                                                      <br>
4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?<br>
                                                      <br>
14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;<br>
                                                      <br>
18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?<br>
                                                      <br>
19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;<br>
                                                      <br>
21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?<br>
                                                      <br>
24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?<br>
                                                      <br>
25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:<br>
                                                      <br>
28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.<br>
                                                      <br>
29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.<br>
                                                      <br>
30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.<br>
                                                      <br>
33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;<br>
                                                      <br>
2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:<br>
                                                      <br>
13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. <br>
                                                      <br>
16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:<br>
                                                      <br>
19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:<br>
                                                      <br>
20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. <br>
                                                      <br>
22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.<br>
                                                      <br>
29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.<br>
                                                      <br>
30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:<br>
                                                      <br>
32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.<br>
                                                      <br>
33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.<br>
                                                      <br>
34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.<br>
                                                      <br>
35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.<br>
                                                      <br>
36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.<br>
                                                      <br>
37 And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.<br>
                                                      <br>
38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?<br>
                                                      <br>
5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. <br>
                                                      <br>
16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:<br>
                                                      <br>
23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 And Abraham said, I will swear.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.<br>
                                                      <br>
29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?<br>
                                                      <br>
30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. <br>
                                                      <br>
32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.<br>
                                                      <br>
33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. <br>
                                                      <br>
34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. <br>
                                                      <br>
2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? <br>
                                                      <br>
8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:<br>
                                                      <br>
17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; <br>
                                                      <br>
18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;<br>
                                                      <br>
21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,<br>
                                                      <br>
4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,<br>
                                                      <br>
6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,<br>
                                                      <br>
9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. <br>
                                                      <br>
10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, <br>
                                                      <br>
11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,<br>
                                                      <br>
15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure<br>
                                                      <br>
18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:<br>
                                                      <br>
4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. <br>
                                                      <br>
11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. <br>
                                                      <br>
12 And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. <br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.<br>
                                                      <br>
29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.<br>
                                                      <br>
30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.<br>
                                                      <br>
33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.<br>
                                                      <br>
34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.<br>
                                                      <br>
35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.<br>
                                                      <br>
36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.<br>
                                                      <br>
37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:<br>
                                                      <br>
38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.<br>
                                                      <br>
39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.<br>
                                                      <br>
40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:<br>
                                                      <br>
41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.<br>
                                                      <br>
42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:<br>
                                                      <br>
43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;<br>
                                                      <br>
44 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.<br>
                                                      <br>
45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.<br>
                                                      <br>
47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.<br>
                                                      <br>
48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.<br>
                                                      <br>
49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.<br>
                                                      <br>
50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.<br>
                                                      <br>
51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.<br>
                                                      <br>
52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. <br>
                                                      <br>
54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.<br>
                                                      <br>
55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. <br>
                                                      <br>
56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.<br>
                                                      <br>
57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.<br>
                                                      <br>
58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.<br>
                                                      <br>
59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.<br>
                                                      <br>
60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.<br>
                                                      <br>
61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.<br>
                                                      <br>
62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.<br>
                                                      <br>
63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. <br>
                                                      <br>
64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.<br>
                                                      <br>
65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.<br>
                                                      <br>
66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.<br>
                                                      <br>
67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;<br>
                                                      <br>
10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,<br>
                                                      <br>
15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: <br>
                                                      <br>
16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren. <br>
                                                      <br>
19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. <br>
                                                      <br>
29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:<br>
                                                      <br>
30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. <br>
                                                      <br>
31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? <br>
                                                      <br>
33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.<br>
                                                      <br>
34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:<br>
                                                      <br>
3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;<br>
                                                      <br>
5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. <br>
                                                      <br>
13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: <br>
                                                      <br>
14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. <br>
                                                      <br>
21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. <br>
                                                      <br>
22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; <br>
                                                      <br>
29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. <br>
                                                      <br>
30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.<br>
                                                      <br>
33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. <br>
                                                      <br>
34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:<br>
                                                      <br>
35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:<br>
                                                      <br>
3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; <br>
                                                      <br>
4 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,<br>
                                                      <br>
7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:<br>
                                                      <br>
12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: <br>
                                                      <br>
16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. <br>
                                                      <br>
21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:<br>
                                                      <br>
28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:<br>
                                                      <br>
29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.<br>
                                                      <br>
33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed. <br>
                                                      <br>
34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.<br>
                                                      <br>
35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.<br>
                                                      <br>
36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? <br>
                                                      <br>
37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? <br>
                                                      <br>
38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.<br>
                                                      <br>
39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; <br>
                                                      <br>
40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.<br>
                                                      <br>
41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.<br>
                                                      <br>
42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;<br>
                                                      <br>
44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;<br>
                                                      <br>
45 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?<br>
                                                      <br>
46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; <br>
                                                      <br>
4 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. <br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; <br>
                                                      <br>
9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. <br>
                                                      <br>
10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. <br>
                                                      <br>
11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,<br>
                                                      <br>
21 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. <br>
                                                      <br>
5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. <br>
                                                      <br>
9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. <br>
                                                      <br>
12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. <br>
                                                      <br>
14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. <br>
                                                      <br>
17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. <br>
                                                      <br>
21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. <br>
                                                      <br>
30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. <br>
                                                      <br>
31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. <br>
                                                      <br>
8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. <br>
                                                      <br>
14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. <br>
                                                      <br>
16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: <br>
                                                      <br>
17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. <br>
                                                      <br>
18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. <br>
                                                      <br>
19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. <br>
                                                      <br>
21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:<br>
                                                      <br>
3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<br>
                                                      <br>
5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <br>
                                                      <br>
8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. <br>
                                                      <br>
9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. <br>
                                                      <br>
17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;<br>
                                                      <br>
18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; <br>
                                                      <br>
19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. <br>
                                                      <br>
21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<br>
                                                      <br>
23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <br>
                                                      <br>
3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: <br>
                                                      <br>
5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?<br>
                                                      <br>
7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. <br>
                                                      <br>
8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. <br>
                                                      <br>
11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;<br>
                                                      <br>
12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. <br>
                                                      <br>
14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. <br>
                                                      <br>
18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. <br>
                                                      <br>
19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. <br>
                                                      <br>
24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. <br>
                                                      <br>
26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.<br>

4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.<br>

                                                      <br>
16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.<br>

                                                      <br>
4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,<br>
                                                      <br>
9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. <br>
                                                      <br>
12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;<br>
                                                      <br>
14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:<br>
                                                      <br>
22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;<br>
                                                      <br>
2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;<br>
                                                      <br>
9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. <br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,<br>
                                                      <br>
16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:<br>
                                                      <br>
19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. <br>
                                                      <br>
22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</span><br>

2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:<br>
                                                      <br>
13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.<br>

                                                      <br>
17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. <br>
                                                      <br>
19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.<br>

20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.<br>
                                                      <br>
25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. <br>
                                                      <br>
27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. <br>

28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. <br>
                                                      <br>
5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. <br>
                                                      <br>
11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, <br>
                                                      <br>
12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, <br>
                                                      <br>
16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. <br>
                                                      <br>
20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. <br>
                                                      <br>
23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. <br>
                                                      <br>
25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. <br>
                                                      <br>
26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,<br>
                                                      <br>
27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,<br>
                                                      <br>
29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.<br>
                                                      <br>
30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. <br>
                                                      <br>
2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. <br>
                                                      <br>
3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. <br>
                                                      <br>
4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: <br>
                                                      <br>
17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: <br>
                                                      <br>
21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:<br>
                                                      <br>
23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: <br>
                                                      <br>
25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
                                                      <br>
26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.<br>
                                                      <br>
27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.<br>
                                                      <br>
28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.<br>
                                                      <br>
29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.<br>
                                                      <br>
30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.<br>
                                                      <br>
31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.<br>
                                                      <br>
32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. <br>
                                                      <br>
10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:<br>
                                                      <br>
12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?<br>
                                                      <br>
19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;<br>
                                                      <br>
4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. <br>
                                                      <br>
9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:<br>
                                                      <br>
15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.<br>
                                                      <br>
3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, <br>
                                                      <br>
6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;<br>
                                                      <br>
9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. <br>
                                                      <br>
14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.<br>
                                                      <br>
18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.<br>
                                                      <br>
19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:<br>
                                                      <br>
20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.<br>
                                                      <br>
21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. <br>
                                                      <br>
22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,<br>
                                                      <br>
23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:<br>
                                                      <br>
24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.</span><br>

                                                      <br>
2 And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?<br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.<br>
                                                      <br>
7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.<br>
                                                      <br>
12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;<br>
                                                      <br>
14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.<br>
                                                      <br>
15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.<br>
                                                      <br>
17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. <br>
                                                      <br>
18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:<br>
                                                      <br>

20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;">1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.<br>
                                                      <br>
2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. <br>
                                                      <br>
3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.<br>
                                                      <br>
4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.<br>
                                                      <br>
5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.<br>
                                                      <br>
6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. <br>
                                                      <br>
7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.<br>
                                                      <br>
8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.<br>
                                                      <br>
9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.<br>
                                                      <br>
10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.<br>
                                                      <br>
11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. <br>
                                                      <br>
12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.<br>
                                                      <br>
13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?<br>
                                                      <br>
14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. <br>
                                                      <br>
15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.<br>
                                                      <br>
16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.</span><br>

The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of God, given by divine inspiration. The inspired authors spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to humanity the knowledge nec¬essary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the supreme, authoritative, and the infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the test of experience, the definitive revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God’s acts in history. (Ps. 119:105; Prov. 30:5, 6; Isa. 8:20; John 17:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 4:12; 2 Peter 1:20, 21.) </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three coeternal Persons. God is immortal, all-powerful, all-know¬ing, above all, and ever present. He is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet known through His self-revelation. God, who is love, is forever worthy of worship, adoration, and service by the whole creation. (Gen. 1:26; Deut. 6:4; Isa. 6:8; Matt. 28:19; John 3:16 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 13:14; Eph. 4:4 6; 1 Peter 1:2.) <br>

God the eternal Father is the Creator, Source, Sustainer, and Sovereign of all creation. He is just and holy, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers exhibited in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also those of the Father.

God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became also truly hu¬man, Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced tempta¬tion as a human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. <br>
                                                      <br>
By His miracles He manifested God’s power and was attested as God’s promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to heaven to minister in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in glory for the final deliverance of His people and the restoration of all things. (Isa. 53:4-6; Dan. 9:25-27; Luke 1:35; John 1:1 3, 14; 5:22; 10:30; 14:1 3, 9, 13; Rom. 6:23; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4; 2 Cor. 3:18; 5:17-19; Phil. 2:5 11; Col. 1:15-19; Heb. 2:9-18; 8:1, 2.)</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in Creation, incarnation, and redemption. He is as much a person as are the Father and the Son. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ’s life with power. He draws and convicts human beings; and those who respond He renews and transforms into the image of God. Sent by the Father and the Son to be always with His children, He extends spiritual gifts to the church, empowers it to bear witness to Christ, and in harmony with the Scriptures leads it into all truth.

God has revealed in Scripture the authentic and historical account of His creative activity. He created the universe, and in a recent six-day creation the Lord made “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” and rested on the seventh day. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual memorial of the work He performed and completed during six literal days that together with the Sabbath constituted the same unit of time that we call a week today. The first man and wom¬an were made in the image of God as the crowning work of Creation, given dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. When the world was finished it was “very good,” declaring the glory of God. (Gen. 1-2; 5; 11; Exod. 20:8-11; Ps. 19:1 6; 33:6, 9; 104; Isa. 45:12, 18; Acts 17:24; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2; 11:3; Rev. 10:6; 14:7.)</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

Man and woman were made in the image of God with individuality, the power and freedom to think and to do. Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity of body, mind, and spirit, dependent upon God for life and breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their dependence upon Him and fell from their high position. <br>
                                                      <br>
The image of God in them was marred and they became subject to death. Their descendants share this fallen nature and its con¬sequences. They are born with weaknesses and tendencies to evil. But God in Christ reconciled the world to Himself and by His Spirit restores in penitent mortals the image of their Maker. Created for the glory of God, they are called to love Him and one another, and to care for their environment.

All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, endowed with freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, God’s adversary, and led into rebellion a portion of the angels. He introduced the spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. <br>
                                                      <br>
This human sin resulted in the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the disordering of the created world, and its eventual devastation at the time of the global flood, as pre¬sented in the historical account of Genesis 1-11. Observed by the whole creation, this world became the arena of the univer¬sal conflict, out of which the God of love will ultimately be vindicated. To assist His people in this controversy, Christ sends the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect, and sustain them in the way of salvation. (Gen. 3; 6-8; Job 1:6-12; Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:12 18; Rom. 1:19-32; 3:4; 5:12-21; 8:19-22; 1 Cor. 4:9; Heb. 1:14; 1 Peter 5:8; 2 Peter 3:6; Rev. 12:4 9.)</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
In Christ’s life of perfect obedience to God’s will, His suffering, death, and resurrection, God provided the only means of atonement for human sin, so that those who by faith accept this atonement may have eternal life, and the whole creation may better understand the infinite and holy love of the Creator. This perfect atonement vindicates the righteousness of God’s law and the graciousness of His character; for it both condemns our sin and provides for our forgiveness. <br>
                                                      <br>
The death of Christ is substitutionary and expiatory, reconciling and transforming. The bodily resurrection of Christ proclaims God’s triumph over the forces of evil, and for those who accept the atonement assures their final victory over sin and death. It declares the Lordship of Jesus Christ, before whom every knee in heaven and on earth will bow. (Gen. 3:15; Ps. 22:1; Isa. 53; John 3:16; 14:30; Rom. 1:4; 3:25; 4:25; 8:3, 4; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4, 20-22; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15, 19-21; Phil. 2:6-11; Col. 2:15; 1 Peter 2:21, 22; 1 John 2:2; 4:10.)<br>

In infinite love and mercy God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, so that in Him we might be made the righ¬teousness of God. Led by the Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of our transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Saviour and Lord, Substitute and Example. This saving faith comes through the divine power of the Word and is the gift of God’s grace. <br>
                                                      <br>
Through Christ we are justified, adopted as God’s sons and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin. Through the Spirit we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews our minds, writes God’s law of love in our hearts, and we are given the power to live a holy life. Abiding in Him we become partakers of the divine nature and have the assurance of salvation now and in the judgment. (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 45:22; 53; Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 33:11; 36:25-27; Hab. 2:4; Mark 9:23, 24; John 3:3-8, 16; 16:8; Rom. 3:21-26; 8:1-4, 14-17; 5:6-10; 10:17; 12:2; 2 Cor. 5:17-21; Gal. 1:4; 3:13, 14, 26; 4:4-7; Eph. 2:4-10; Col. 1:13, 14; Titus 3:3-7; Heb. 8:7 12; 1 Peter 1:23; 2:21, 22; 2 Peter 1:3, 4; Rev. 13:8.)<br>

By His death on the cross Jesus triumphed over the forces of evil. He who subjugated the demonic spirits during His earthly ministry has broken their power and made certain their ultimate doom. Jesus’ victory gives us victory over the evil forces that still seek to control us, as we walk with Him in peace, joy, and assurance of His love. <br>
                                                      <br>
Now the Holy Spirit dwells within us and empowers us. Continually committed to Jesus as our Saviour and Lord, we are set free from the burden of our past deeds. No longer do we live in the darkness, fear of evil powers, ignorance, and meaninglessness of our former way of life. In this new freedom in Jesus, we are called to grow into the likeness of His character, communing with Him daily in prayer, feeding on His Word, meditating on it and on His providence, singing His praises, gathering together for worship, and participating in the mission of the Church. <br>
                                                      <br>
We are also called to follow Christ’s example by compassionately ministering to the physical, mental, social, emotional, and spiritual needs of humanity. As we give ourselves in loving service to those around us and in witnessing to His salvation, His constant presence with us through the Spirit transforms every moment and every task into a spiritual experience.

The church is the community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. In continuity with the people of God in Old Testament times, we are called out from the world; and we join together for worship, for fellowship, for instruction in the Word, for the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, for service to humanity, and for the worldwide procla¬mation of the gospel. The church derives its authority from Christ, who is the incarnate Word revealed in the Scriptures. <br>
                                                      <br>
The church is God’s family; adopted by Him as children, its members live on the basis of the new covenant. The church is the body of Christ, a community of faith of which Christ Himself is the Head. The church is the bride for whom Christ died that He might sanctify and cleanse her. At His return in triumph, He will present her to Himself a glorious church, the faithful of all the ages, the purchase of His blood, not having spot or wrinkle, but holy and without blemish.

The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but in the last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This remnant announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent. This proclamation is symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14; it coincides with the work of judgment in heaven and results in a work of repentance and reform on earth. Every believer is called to have a personal part in this worldwide witness. (Dan. 7:9-14; Isa. 1:9; 11:11; Jer. 23:3; Mic. 2:12; 2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Peter 1:16-19; 4:17; 2 Peter 3:10-14; Jude 3, 14; Rev. 12:17; 14:6-12; 18:1-4.)<br>

The church is one body with many members, called from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. In Christ we are a new creation; distinctions of race, culture, learning, and nationality, and differences between high and low, rich and poor, male and female, must not be divisive among us. We are all equal in Christ, who by one Spirit has bonded us into one fellowship with Him and with one another; we are to serve and be served without partiality or reservation. Through the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Scriptures we share the same faith and hope, and reach out in one witness to all. This unity has its source in the oneness of the triune God, who has adopted us as His children. (Ps. 133:1; Matt. 28:19, 20; John 17:20-23; Acts 17:26, 27; Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-14; 2 Cor. 5:16, 17; Gal. 3:27 29; Eph. 2:13-16; 4:3 6, 11-16; Col. 3:10-15.)<br>

By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our death to sin and of our pur¬pose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings.

The Lord’s Supper is a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour. In this experience of communion Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people. As we partake, we joyfully proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes again. Preparation for the Supper includes self-examination, repentance, and confession. The Master ordained the service of foot-washing to signify renewed cleansing, to express a willingness to serve one another in Christlike humility, and to unite our hearts in love. The communion service is open to all believing Christians. (Matt. 26:17-30; John 6:48-63; 13:1 17; 1 Cor. 10:16, 17; 11:23-30; Rev. 3:20.)</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

God bestows upon all members of His church in every age spiritual gifts that each member is to employ in loving minis¬try for the common good of the church and of humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who apportions to each member as He wills, the gifts provide all abilities and ministries needed by the church to fulfill its divinely ordained func¬tions. <br>
                                                      <br>
According to the Scriptures, these gifts include such ministries as faith, healing, prophecy, proclamation, teaching, ad¬ministration, reconciliation, compassion, and self-sacrificing service and charity for the help and encouragement of people. Some members are called of God and endowed by the Spirit for functions recognized by the church in pastoral, evangelis¬tic, and teaching ministries particularly needed to equip the members for service, to build up the church to spiritual matu¬rity, and to foster unity of the faith and knowledge of God. <br>
                                                      <br>
When members employ these spiritual gifts as faithful stewards of God’s varied grace, the church is protected from the destructive influence of false doctrine, grows with a growth that is from God, and is built up in faith and love. (Acts 6:1-7; Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:7-11, 27, 28; Eph. 4:8, 11 16; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; 1 Peter 4:10, 11.)<br>

The Scriptures testify that one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and we believe it was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Her writings speak with prophetic authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction to the church. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Num. 12:6; 2 Chron. 20:20; Amos 3:7; Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 12:17; 19:10; 22:8, 9.)<br>

The great principles of God’s law are embodied in the Ten Commandments and exemplified in the life of Christ. They express God’s love, will, and purposes concerning human conduct and relationships and are binding upon all people in every age. These precepts are the basis of God’s covenant with His people and the standard in God’s judgment. Through the agency of the Holy Spirit they point out sin and awaken a sense of need for a Saviour. <br>
                                                      <br>
Salvation is all of grace and not of works, and its fruit is obedience to the Commandments. This obedience develops Christian character and results in a sense of well being. It is evidence of our love for the Lord and our concern for our fellow human beings. The obedience of faith demonstrates the power of Christ to transform lives, and therefore strengthens Christian witness. (Exod. 20:1-17; Deut. 28:1-14; Ps. 19:7-14; 40:7, 8; Matt. 5:17-20; 22:36-40; John 14:15; 15:7-10; Rom. 8:3, 4; Eph. 2:8-10; Heb. 8:8-10; 1 John 2:3; 5:3; Rev. 12:17; 14:12.)<br>

The gracious Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of Creation. The fourth commandment of God’s unchangeable law requires the observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the Sab-bath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one another. <br>
                                                      <br>
It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our eternal future in God’s kingdom. The Sabbath is God’s perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and His people. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, sunset to sunset, is a celebration of God’s creative and redemptive acts.

We are God’s stewards, entrusted by Him with time and opportunities, abilities and possessions, and the blessings of the earth and its resources. We are responsible to Him for their proper use. We acknowledge God’s ownership by faithful ser¬vice to Him and our fellow human beings, and by returning tithe and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and the support and growth of His church. Stewardship is a privilege given to us by God for nurture in love and the victo¬ry over selfishness and covetousness. Stewards rejoice in the blessings that come to others as a result of their faithfulness.

We are called to be a godly people who think, feel, and act in harmony with biblical principles in all aspects of personal and social life. For the Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we involve ourselves only in those things that will produce Christlike purity, health, and joy in our lives. This means that our amusement and entertainment should meet the highest standards of Christian taste and beauty. <br>
                                                      <br>
While recognizing cultural differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat, befitting those whose true beauty does not consist of outward adornment but in the imperishable ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit. It also means that because our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we are to care for them intelligent¬ly. Along with adequate exercise and rest, we are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures. <br>
                                                      <br>
Since alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and the irresponsible use of drugs and narcotics are harmful to our bodies, we are to abstain from them as well. Instead, we are to engage in whatever brings our thoughts and bodies into the discipline of Christ, who desires our wholesomeness, joy, and goodness. (Gen. 7:2; Exod. 20:15; Lev. 11:1-47; Ps. 106:3; Rom. 12:1, 2; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 10:31; 2 Cor. 6:14-7:1; 10:5; Eph. 5:1-21; Phil. 2:4; 4:8; 1 Tim. 2:9, 10; Titus 2:11, 12; 1 Peter 3:1 4; 1 John 2:6; 3 John 2.)<br>

Marriage was divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be a lifelong union between a man and a woman in loving companionship. For the Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, and should be entered into only between a man and a woman who share a common faith. Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility are the fabric of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, closeness, and permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church. Regarding divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. <br>
                                                      <br>
Although some family relationships may fall short of the ideal, a man and a woman who fully commit themselves to each other in Christ through marriage may achieve loving unity through the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the church. God blesses the family and intends that its members shall assist each other toward complete maturity. Increasing family closeness is one of the earmarks of the final gospel message. <br>
                                                      <br>
Parents are to bring up their children to love and obey the Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them that Christ is a loving, tender, and caring guide who wants them to become members of His body, the family of God which embraces both single and married persons.

There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle that the Lord set up and not humans. In it Christ ministers on our behalf, making available to believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice offered once for all on the cross. At His ascension, He was inaugurated as our great High Priest and, began His intercessory ministry, which was typified by the work of the high priest in the holy place of the earthly sanctuary. <br>
                                                      <br>
In 1844, at the end of the prophetic period of 2300 days, He entered the second and last phase of His atoning ministry, which was typified by the work of the high priest in the most holy place of the earthly sanctuary. It is a work of investigative judgment which is part of the ultimate disposition of all sin, typified by the cleansing of the ancient Hebrew sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. In that typical service the sanctuary was cleansed with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things are purified with the perfect sacrifice of the blood of Jesus. <br>
                                                      <br>
The investigative judgment reveals to heavenly intelligences who among the dead are asleep in Christ and therefore, in Him, are deemed worthy to have part in the first resurrection. It also makes manifest who among the living are abiding in Christ, keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and in Him, therefore, are ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. This judgment vindicates the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus. It declares that those who have remained loyal to God shall receive the kingdom. <br>
                                                      <br>
The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of human probation before the Second Advent.

The second coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the grand climax of the gospel. The Saviour’s coming will be literal, personal, visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be glorified and taken to heaven, but the unrighteous will die. <br>
                                                      <br>
The almost complete fulfillment of most lines of prophecy, together with the present condition of the world, indicates that Christ’s coming is near. The time of that event has not been revealed, and we are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times. (Matt. 24; Mark 13; Luke 21; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-18; 5:1-6; 2 Thess. 1:7-10; 2:8; 2 Tim. 3:1-5; Titus 2:13; Heb. 9:28; Rev. 1:7; 14:14-20; 19:11-21.)<br>

The millennium is the thousand-year reign of Christ with His saints in heaven between the first and second resurrections. During this time the wicked dead will be judged; the earth will be utterly desolate, without living human inhabitants, but occupied by Satan and his angels. At its close Christ with His saints and the Holy City will descend from heaven to earth. The unrighteous dead will then be resurrected, and with Satan and his angels will surround the city; but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the earth. The universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever.

church of God” (Acts 20:28), “the body of Christ” (Eph. 4:12), and “the<br>
church of the living God” (1 Tim. 3:15).<br>
                                                      <br>
To belong to the church of God is a unique and soul-satisfying<br>
privilege. It is God’s purpose to gather out a people from the far corners of the earth to bind them into one body, the body of Christ, of which He is the living head. All who are children of God in Christ Jesus are members of this body, and in this relationship they may enjoy fellowship with each other and fellowship also with their Lord.<br>
                                                      <br>
The Bible uses the word <em>church </em>in at least two senses: a general sense<br>
applying to the church in all the world (Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 12:28) and a<br>
particular sense applying to the church in a city or a province, such as to<br>
those at Rome (Rom. 1:6, 7), Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and Thessalonica<br>
(1 Thess. 1:1) and of Galatia (1 Cor. 16:1), Asia (1 Cor. 16:19), and Syria<br>
and Cilicia (Acts 15:41).<br>
Christ, being the head of the church and its living Lord, has a deep love<br>
for the members of His body. In the church He is to be glorified<br>
(Eph. 3:21). Through the church He will reveal the “manifold wisdom of<br>
God” (Eph. 3:10). Day by day He nourishes the church (Eph. 5:29), and His longing desire is to make of it “a glorious church, not having spot or<br>
wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish”<br>
(Eph. 5:27).<br>

there was to be no dividing wall between Israel and other nations<br>
(John 4:4-42; 10:16; Luke 9:51-56; Matt. 15:21-28). The apostle Paul<br>
writes, “The Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and<br>
partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel” (Eph. 3:6).<br>
Nor is there to be among Christ’s followers any preference of caste or<br>
nationality or race or color, for all are of one blood. The elect of God are a universal brotherhood, a new humanity, “all one in Christ Jesus”<br>
(Gal. 3:28).<br>
                                                      <br>
“Christ came to this earth with a message of mercy and forgiveness. He<br>
laid the foundation for a religion by which Jew and Gentile, black and<br>
white, free and bond, are linked together in one common brotherhood,<br>
                                                      <em>CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD 21</em><br>
recognized as equal in the sight of God. The Savior has a boundless love for<br>
every human being.”—7T 225.<br>
“No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste is recognized<br>
by God. He is the Maker of all mankind. All men are of one family by<br>
creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ came to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open every compartment of the temple, that every soul may have free access to God. . . . In Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free. All are brought nigh by His precious blood.”—COL 386.<br>

of the church” (1 Tim. 3:5), to “shepherd the church of God” (Acts 20:28),<br>
and to show “concern for all the churches” (2 Cor. 11:28).<br>
                                                      <br>
“I testify to my brethren and sisters that the church of Christ, enfeebled<br>
and defective as it may be, is the only object on earth on which He bestows His supreme regard. While He extends to all the world His invitation to come to Him and be saved, He commissions His angels to render divine help to every soul that cometh to Him in repentance and contrition, and He comes personally by His Holy Spirit into the midst of His church.”—TM 15.<br>
                                                      <br>
As the bride of Christ and the supreme object of His regard, the church<br>
is expected in all its functions to represent the order and the character of the<br>
divine.<br>
“At this time the church is to put on her beautiful garments—‘Christ<br>
our righteousness.’ There are clear, decided distinctions to be restored and<br>
exemplified to the world in holding aloft the commandments of God and the<br>
faith of Jesus. The beauty of holiness is to appear in its native luster in<br>
contrast with the deformity and darkness of the disloyal, those who have<br>
revolted from the law of God. Thus we acknowledge God, and recognize<br>
His law, the foundation of His government in heaven and throughout His<br>
earthly dominions. His authority should be kept distinct and plain before the<br>
world, and no laws are to be acknowledged that come in collision with the<br>
laws of Jehovah. If in defiance of God’s arrangements the world be allowed<br>
to influence our decisions or our actions, the purpose of God is defeated.<br>
However specious the pretext, if the church waver here, there is written<br>
against her in the books of heaven a betrayal of the most sacred trusts, and<br>
treachery to the kingdom of Christ. The church is firmly and decidedly to<br>
hold her principles before the whole heavenly universe and the kingdoms of<br>
                                                      <em>22 CHURCH MANUAL</em><br>
the world; steadfast fidelity in maintaining the honor and sacredness of the<br>
law of God will attract the notice and admiration of even the world, and<br>
many will, by the good works which they shall behold, be led to glorify our Father in heaven.”—TM 16, 17.<br>
                                                      <br>
The apostle Peter writes, “But you are a chosen generation, a royal<br>
priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim<br>
the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light”<br>
(1 Peter 2:9).<br>

they may present to the world an image of His own sufficiency, and that His church may be complete in Him, a continual representation of another, even the eternal world, of laws that are higher than earthly laws. His church is to be a temple built after the divine similitude, and the angelic architect has brought his golden measuring rod from heaven, that every stone may be hewed and squared by the divine measurement and polished to shine as an emblem of heaven, radiating in all directions the bright, clear beams of the Sun of Righteousness. . . .<br>
                                                      <br>
“The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts through the<br>
exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is effecting transformations<br>
so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting, with all his<br>
confederacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government,<br>
stands viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and<br>
delusions. They are to him an incomprehensible mystery. The angels of<br>
God, seraphim and cherubim, the powers commissioned to cooperate with<br>
human agencies, look on with astonishment and joy that fallen men, once<br>
children of wrath, are through the training of Christ developing characters<br>
after the divine similitude, to be sons and daughters of God, to act an<br>
important part in the occupations and pleasures of heaven.<br>
“To His church, Christ has given ample facilities, that He may receive a<br>
large revenue of glory from His redeemed, purchased possession. The<br>
church, being endowed with the righteousness of Christ, is His depository,<br>
in which the wealth of His mercy, His love, His grace, is to appear in full<br>
and final display. . . .<br>
“In their untainted purity and spotless perfection, Christ looks upon His<br>
people as the reward of all His suffering, His humiliation, and His love, and<br>
the supplement of His glory—Christ, the great center from which radiates<br>

                                                      <br>
The church is committed to the foregoing principles of the spiritual unity of Christ’s church. By the peace and power which Christ’s righteousness brings, the church pledges to conquer every barrier that sin has erected between human beings. <br>

organization, wonderful alike for its completeness and its simplicity. The<br>
order so strikingly displayed in the perfection and arrangement of all God’s created works was manifest in the Hebrew economy. God was the center of authority and government, the sovereign of Israel. Moses stood as their visible leader, by God’s appointment, to administer the laws in His name.<br>
                                                      <br>
From the elders of the tribes a council of seventy was afterward chosen to<br>
assist Moses in the general affairs of the nation. Next came the priests, who<br>
consulted the Lord in the sanctuary. Chiefs, or princes, ruled over the tribes.<br>
Under these were ‘captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and<br>
captains over fifties, and captains over tens,’ and, lastly, officers who might<br>
be employed for special duties.”—PP 374.<br>
The New Testament church showed the same perfection in its<br>
organization. Christ Himself, who formed the church (Matt. 16:18), “set the<br>
members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased” (1 Cor. 12:18).<br>
He endowed them with gifts and talents adequate for the functions<br>
devolving upon them and organized them into a living, working body, of<br>
which He is the head.<br>
“For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do<br>
not the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and<br>
individually members of one another” (Rom. 12:4, 5). “And He [Christ] is<br>
the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from<br>
the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence” (Col. 1:18).<br>
“There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences<br>
of ministries, but the same Lord” (1 Cor. 12:4, 5). “For as the body is one<br>
                                                      <em>ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY 25</em><br>
and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ” (1 Cor. 12:12). “Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues” (1 Cor. 12:27, 28).<br>

are organically united and functioning together, so there can be no living,<br>
growing, prospering church unless its members are organized into a united spiritual body, all performing their God-given duties and functions under the direction of a divinely constituted authority. Without organization no institution or movement can prosper. A nation without organized government would be chaos. A business enterprise without organization would fail. A church without organization would disintegrate and perish.<br>

For the sake of the Church’s healthy development and for the<br>
accomplishment of its task of carrying the gospel of salvation to all the<br>
world, Christ gave it a simple but effective system of organization. Success<br>
in its endeavors to achieve its mission depends on loyal adherence to this<br>
divine pattern.<br>
“Some have advanced the thought that as we near the close of time,<br>
every child of God will act independently of any religious organization. But<br>
I have been instructed by the Lord that in this work there is no such thing as<br>
every man’s being independent.”—TM 489.<br>
“Oh, how Satan would rejoice if he could succeed in his efforts to get<br>
in among this people and disorganize the work at a time when thorough<br>
organization is essential and will be the greatest power to keep out spurious uprisings and to refute claims not endorsed by the Word of God! We want to hold the lines evenly, that there shall be no breaking down of the system of organization and order that has been built up by wise, careful labor.<br>
                                                      <br>

organization there would be great confusion, and the work would not be<br>
carried forward successfully. To provide for the support of the ministry, for carrying the work in new fields, for protecting both the churches and the ministry from unworthy members, for holding church property, for the<br>
publication of the truth through the press, and for many other objects,<br>
organization was indispensable.”—TM 26.<br>

“As members of the visible church, and workers in the vineyard of the<br>
Lord, all professed Christians should do their utmost to preserve peace,<br>
harmony, and love in the church. Mark the prayer of Christ: ‘That they all<br>
may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.’ The unity of the church is the convincing evidence that God has sent Jesus into the world as its Redeemer.”—5T 619, 620.<br>

world (Matt. 28:19, 20; Mark 16:15) meant not only preaching the gospel<br>
but ensuring the welfare of those who accepted that message. This involved shepherding as well as housing the flock, and also meeting relationship problems. Such a situation called for organization.<br>
                                                      <br>
At first the apostles constituted a council that directed the activities of<br>
the church from Jerusalem (Acts 6:2; 8:14). When the company there<br>
became so large that the administration of its practical affairs became a<br>
problem, the church appointed deacons to care for its business (Acts 6:2-4).<br>
                                                      <br>
Later other congregations grew up, not only in Asia but also in Europe,<br>
and this called for further organizational steps. In Asia Minor elders were<br>
ordained “in every church” (Acts 14:23). Extension of the work throughout the various provinces of the Roman Empire called for organization of churches into what might be called conferences (Gal. 1:2). Thus, step by step, organization grew in the early church. As needs arose, God directed the leaders of His work so that, in counsel with the church, they developed a form of organization that safeguarded the interests of the work.<br>

recognizes that authority rests in the membership and is expressed through duly elected representatives at each level of organization, with executive responsibility delegated to representative bodies and officers for the governing of the Church at each separate level. The <em>Church Manual </em>applies this principle of representation to the operations of the local congregation.<br>
                                                      <br>
Issues of representation in organizations with mission status are defined by operating policies and in organizations with conference status by their<br>
constitution and bylaws. This form of governance recognizes also that<br>
ordination to the ministry is recognized by the Church worldwide.<br>
“Every member of the church has a voice in choosing officers of the<br>
church. The church chooses the officers of the state conferences. Delegates<br>
chosen by the state conferences choose the officers of the union<br>
conferences, and delegates chosen by the union conferences choose the<br>
officers of the General Conference. By this arrangement every conference,<br>
every institution, every church, and every individual, either directly or<br>
through representatives, has a voice in the election of the men who bear the<br>
chief responsibilities in the General Conference.”—8T 236, 237.<br>
The present organizational system of the Church resulted from a<br>
developing theological understanding of the mission of the Church,<br>
membership growth, and the Church’s geographic spread. Representatives<br>
of conferences met in 1863 to organize the General Conference of<br>
Seventh-day Adventists.<br>
There are several organizational levels within the Church leading from<br>
the individual believer to the worldwide organization of the work.<br>
Membership units in each of these levels periodically convene formal<br>
business sessions known as constituency meetings or sessions. (The<br>
constituency meeting or session of a local church is generally referred to as a business meeting.) In Seventh-day Adventist Church structure, no<br>
organization determines its own status, nor does it function as if it had no obligations to the Church family beyond its boundaries.<br>

5. General Conference and Its Divisions—The General Conference<br>
represents the worldwide expression of the Church. Its constituent<br>
membership is defined in its Constitution. To facilitate its worldwide<br>
activity, the General Conference has established regional offices, known as<br>
divisions of the General Conference, which have been assigned, by action<br>
of the General Conference Executive Committee at Annual Councils,<br>
general administrative oversight for designated groups of unions and other<br>
Church units within specific geographical areas.<br>
The Bible is the foundation and source of belief and practice; on this<br>
basis, the General Conference in Session determines the stated fundamental<br>
beliefs of the Church. The General Conference in Session also authorizes<br>
establishment of unions and the attachment of field units, revises the<br>
                                                      <em>Church Manual</em>, elects General Conference and division leadership,<br>
performs other functions as outlined in its Constitution and Bylaws, and<br>
considers items referred to it by its Executive Committee. The General<br>
Conference Executive Committee between Sessions is empowered by the Constitution and Bylaws to act on behalf of the constituents. Thus Church organizations around the world recognize the General Conference in<br>
Session as the voice of the Church.<br>

God alone is the source of authority for the Church. He delegated authority to His prophets and apostles (2 Cor. 10:8). They, therefore, occupied a crucial and unique position in the transmission of the Word of God and the edification of the church (Eph. 2:20).<br>
                                                      <br>
The early church bore responsibility for purity in doctrine and practice.<br>
The elders (or bishops) held great authority. One of their main functions<br>
was general pastoral care and oversight (Acts 20:17-28; Heb. 13:17;<br>
1 Peter 5:1-3), with special tasks such as giving instruction in sound<br>
doctrine and refuting those who contradicted it (1 Tim. 3:1, 2; Titus 1:5, 9).<br>
They were instructed to “test the spirits, whether they are of God”<br>
(1 John 4:1) or, in Paul’s terms, to “test all things” and “hold fast what is<br>
good” (1 Thess. 5:21).<br>
                                                      <br>
The same was true regarding its exercise of discipline (Matt. 18:15-17),<br>
which ranged from private and caring admonition (cf. Matt. 18:16; Gal. 6:1) to removal from membership (Matt. 18:18; 1 Cor. 5:11, 13; 2 Cor. 2:5-11).<br>
                                                      <br>
The Church thus has authority to settle the rules for its own<br>
governance.<br>

Conference Executive Committee between Sessions, is the highest<br>
ecclesiastical authority in the administration of the Church. The General<br>
Conference Executive Committee is authorized by its Constitution to create subordinate organizations with authority to carry out their roles. Therefore all subordinate organizations and institutions throughout the Church will recognize the General Conference Session, and the General Conference Executive Committee between Sessions, as the highest ecclesiastical authority, under God, among Seventh-day Adventists.<br>

institutions, matters that are not mutually resolved may be appealed to the<br>

other organization.<br>
“I have often been instructed by the Lord that no man’s judgment<br>
should be surrendered to the judgment of any other one man. Never should<br>
the mind of one man or the minds of a few men be regarded as sufficient in<br>
wisdom and power to control the work and to say what plans shall be<br>
followed. But when, in a General Conference, the judgment of the brethren<br>
assembled from all parts of the field is exercised, private independence and private judgment must not be stubbornly maintained, but surrendered. <br>
                                                      <br>

gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. . . . ’<br>

“Men appointed of God have been chosen to watch with jealous care,<br>
with vigilant perseverance, that the church may not be overthrown by the<br>
evil devices of Satan, but that she shall stand in the world to promote the<br>
glory of God among men.”—TM 52, 53.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Conference President</em></strong>—The conference president should be an<br>
ordained pastor of experience and good report. He stands at the head of the<br>
gospel ministry in the conference and is the chief elder, or overseer, of all<br>
the churches. He works for their spiritual welfare and counsels them<br>
regarding their activities and plans. He has access to all the churches and<br>
their services, business meetings, and boards, without vote unless granted<br>
by the church, or unless he is a member of that congregation. He may, by<br>
virtue of his office, preside over any meeting of any church when necessary.<br>
He has access to all church records.<br>
The conference president does not have authority to set aside the duly<br>
elected officers of the church, but will work in cooperation with them. They<br>
in turn are bound, in recognition of the ties of conference fellowship, to<br>
counsel with him over all that pertains to the welfare of the church. They<br>
should not attempt to exclude him from a proper discharge of his duties.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Conference Departmental Directors</em></strong>—Conference departmental<br>
directors foster important lines of denominational work under the general<br>
direction of the conference committee in consultation with the conference<br>
president. In order to successfully carry on the work assigned to them, these<br>
employees must have access to the churches so they can present and<br>
develop their plans. These employees will have sympathetic consideration<br>
for all church plans, even outside their respective departments.<br>
Departmental directors are not vested with administrative or executive<br>
authority, so their relation to local churches is advisory. Their work does<br>
not bear the same relationship to the churches as that of the conference<br>
committee or president. In the promotion of their specific kinds of work,<br>
they labor throughout the entire conference. However, they are not expected<br>
to counsel churches regarding elections and other administrative duties or<br>
any other line of service, unless especially requested to do so by the<br>
conference president.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Ordained Pastors</em></strong>—Ordained pastors appointed by the conference<br>
committee to act as pastors or district leaders do not take the place of the<br>
president in their respective fields. They are not charged with administrative<br>
powers as is the president, but they cooperate with him in carrying out the<br>
plans and policies of the conference.<br>
On assignment to a local church, the ordained pastor is assisted by the<br>
local elders. By virtue of ordination, the pastor is qualified to function in all<br>
rites and ceremonies. The pastor should be the congregation’s spiritual<br>
leader and adviser. Pastors should instruct the officers in their duties and<br>
plan with them for all lines of church work and activity.<br>
The pastor is a member of the church board and serves as its<br>
chairperson. If the pastor desires to be relieved of the responsibility of<br>
acting as chairperson of the board, an elder serves as chairperson in<br>
cooperation with the pastor. (See p. 74.) The pastor, with the assistance of<br>
the elders, is expected to plan for and lead out in all spiritual services, such<br>
as Sabbath morning worship and prayer meeting, and should officiate at the<br>
communion service and baptism. Pastors should not surround themselves<br>
with any special body of counselors of their own choosing, but always<br>
cooperate with the elected officers.<br>
When an evangelist is asked to conduct an evangelistic effort where<br>
there is a church, the conference should invite the pastor to assist the<br>
evangelist, thus giving the pastor an opportunity to become acquainted with<br>
prospective members.<br>
Pastors or assistant pastors are not nominated or elected to such<br>
positions by the church. Their connection with the church is by appointment<br>
of the conference committee, and such appointments may be changed at any<br>
time. (See p. 74.)<br>
A pastor may be removed from office by conference committee action<br>
without the individual’s church membership being affected. But when a<br>
pastor is removed from church membership and subsequently restored to<br>
membership as a layperson, the pastor’s membership restoration does not<br>
mean restoration to the ministry.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Licensed Pastors</em></strong>—To give individuals an opportunity to demonstrate<br>
their call to the ministry, especially in the area of soul winning, prospective<br>
candidates are granted pastoral licenses by the conference. The granting of<br>
such licenses confers the opportunity to develop the ministerial gift.<br>
Licensed pastors are authorized to preach, to engage in evangelism, to<br>
lead out in outreach (missionary) work, and to assist in all church activities.<br>
There are circumstances, however, where it is necessary for the<br>
conference to appoint a licensed pastor to carry responsibility as a pastor or<br>
assistant pastor of a church or group of churches. In order to open the way<br>
for a licensed pastor to perform certain pastoral functions, the church or<br>
group of churches being served must elect the pastor as a local elder. Then,<br>
since the right to permit the extension of a licensed pastor’s authority rests<br>
first with the division executive committee, it must approve the extension<br>
by specifically and clearly defining the additional functions that that<br>
licensed pastor may perform. The extended functions are limited only to the<br>
church or group of churches where the pastor is assigned and is an elder.<br>
After the division committee acts, the conference committee may act.<br>
(See p. 74.)<br>
The conference committee shall not extend the functions of a licensed<br>
pastor beyond what has been authorized by the division committee. It also<br>
shall not authorize a licensed pastor to perform the extended functions in<br>
any church beyond where the licensed pastor is assigned and is an elder. A<br>
conference committee action cannot be substituted for church election or<br>
ordination to gospel ministry.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Bible Instructors</em></strong>—The conference may employ Bible instructors and<br>
assign them to work with evangelistic efforts or with local congregations.<br>
Though the instructors work under the general direction of the conference,<br>
an instructor assigned to an evangelistic effort works under the direction of<br>
the evangelist conducting the campaign, and an instructor assigned to a<br>
church works under the direction of the pastor. An instructor should not,<br>
except by special arrangement with the conference, be asked to carry a<br>
church office, but should be left free to carry on soul-winning work.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Conference Directs Church Employees</em></strong>—The conference president<br>
in counsel with the conference committee directs all conference employees,<br>
                                                      <em>34 CHURCH MANUAL</em><br>
such as pastors, Bible instructors, and departmental directors, who receive<br>
their credentials from and are responsible to the conference, not the local<br>
church. A church may ask the conference president for the services or help<br>
of conference employees, but appointments in all cases rest with the<br>
conference committee. The conference committee may change employee<br>
assignments whenever it believes they are needed. The employee or the<br>
church may appeal to the conference committee for a hearing on the<br>
decision to remove the employee, and the committee will carefully consider<br>
the appeal in light of the needs of the entire conference. If the employee<br>
refuses to cooperate with the committee and declines to work in harmony with its decisions, the committee may regard the employee’s conduct as insubordination and may deal with it accordingly. In no case should the employee appeal to the church regarding such decisions. If a local church supports an employee’s refusal to cooperate, it also becomes subject to conference discipline.<br>

the local church to the General Conference. Official credentials and licenses are issued to all authorized full-time Church employees and are granted by controlling committees for limited periods.<br>

In a local conference, the committee confers authority upon individuals<br>
to represent the Church as pastors and gospel workers. This authority is<br>
represented by the granting of credentials and licenses, which are written<br>
commissions, properly dated and signed by the officers of the conference.<br>
The authority thus conveyed is not personal or inherent in the individual but<br>
is inherent in the granting body, which may recall the credentials for cause<br>
at any time. Credentials and licenses granted employees are not their<br>
personal property and must be returned when employment is terminated or<br>
at the request of the organization that issued them.<br>
No one should be allowed to speak to any congregation unless he/she<br>
has been invited by the church in harmony with guidelines given by the<br>
conference. It is recognized, however, that there are times when<br>
congregations may be addressed by government officials or civic leaders;<br>
but all unauthorized persons shall not be given access to the pulpit.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">A church is organized by an ordained pastor on the recommendation of<br>
the conference executive committee. (For the procedure for organizing a<br>
company, see pp. 37, 38.) Since so much is involved in the organization of a church, the local conference president should be invited to be present.<br>
                                                      <br>
When a company of baptized believers is prepared to assume the<br>
responsibilities of an organized church, it must consult with the conference president and obtain approval from the conference executive committee prior to seeking a date for the organization to take place.<br>
When the baptized believers assemble on the agreed-upon date, the<br>
individual officiating should first present a brief review of the fundamental<br>
beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists.<br>
Then the one presiding should make a call asking all who are in<br>
agreement with these principles and who desire to unite in church<br>
fellowship to come forward. The name of each person should be recorded.<br>
If any are already members of the conference church or another<br>
congregation, the one officiating should present the letters of transfers they<br>
have secured. Those transferring form the nucleus of the congregation.<br>
If, however, there are no transferring members, then three members<br>
(preferably established Sabbathkeepers among those present) should be<br>
selected as a nucleus. They may be asked these questions: Do you accept<br>
Christ as your personal Savior? Are you in full harmony with the principles<br>
of faith that have just been presented? Have you been baptized by<br>
immersion? Are you in regular standing and enjoying one another’s<br>
confidence?<br>
If they answer these questions in the affirmative, the three are declared<br>
the nucleus of the new church. Then one after another the names that were<br>
recorded are called, each person is asked the questions listed in the<br>
preceding paragraph, and the presiding person takes a vote among the<br>
nucleus to receive each individual into church fellowship. Each person thus<br>
received becomes a member of the church and is qualified to vote on the<br>
next name. Care should be taken to see that full fellowship and brotherly<br>
love exist among those received into membership. Should any difficulty<br>
arise in any case over a question either of doctrine or of fellowship, action<br>
should be deferred unless the matter can be adjusted kindly and tactfully.<br>
When the nucleus has voted on all potential members, the church is a<br>
complete entity and ready for election of officers. Members then should<br>
choose a nominating committee, with the officiating pastor serving as<br>
chairperson. The nominating committee brings in nominations to fill the<br>
various church offices. When these have been elected, the elders should be<br>
ordained, unless they have already been ordained as elders. A similar but<br>
shorter service should take place for ordination of deacons and deaconesses.<br>
The church then is fully organized and ready for service.<br>
Before the organizing meeting ends, the members should vote to<br>
request the conference to receive the newly organized church into the<br>
sisterhood of churches at the next conference session.<br>
To maximize success of the new congregation, conference and local<br>
leaders should see that all officers are fully instructed concerning their<br>
duties. The church also should have the materials needed for the<br>
communion service, which, if possible, should be celebrated as part of the<br>
organizational meeting. The treasurer, the clerk, and the other officers<br>
should receive all the necessary records or equipment needed to carry out<br>
their responsibilities.<br>

they belong to a small group, house church, or church planting core group,<br>
they should consider forming a company of believers for fellowship,<br>
worship, and mission with the objective of growing into an organized<br>
church or multiplying house churches in that geographical area.<br>
Company status is approved by vote of the conference committee,<br>
which, should it become necessary, may subsequently dissolve the<br>
company. The division and/or conference should have written guidelines for<br>
organizing companies within its territory.<br>
Church members who are part of small groups or house groups may<br>
form the nucleus of a new company. Membership of all those who want to<br>
be part of a company should be held in either the conference church or a<br>
local church (mother church). If membership for those who want to be part<br>
of a company is to be held in the conference church, the conference<br>
committee will vote their membership transfers to the conference church<br>
and indicate that they are part of the new company.<br>
When the conference committee approves establishment of a company,<br>
a leadership team should be appointed, including a leader, a clerk, and a<br>
treasurer. The appointment should be carried out by the district pastor, or<br>
other pastor appointed by the conference committee, in counsel with the<br>
group being established as a company.<br>
All other company appointments should be made by vote of those who<br>
are part of the group that is forming the company. The district pastor or<br>
other person authorized by the conference committee shall preside at such a<br>
meeting. Only members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in regular<br>
standing shall be appointed.<br>
The leader of a company shall not be ordained to that office and does<br>
not have the authority to perform those functions that are vested in an elder<br>
of a church. However, where exceptional circumstances warrant, the<br>
conference committee may appoint a person of church experience and<br>
leadership ability to serve as elder of the company.<br>
The clerk of the company shall keep record of all activities and<br>
meetings of the company and shall send regular statistical reports to the<br>
mother church or the conference executive secretary. These reports should<br>
include statistics on attendance and activities of the company, including<br>
outreach ministries conducted during the week or on Sabbath.<br>
The treasurer of the company shall keep record of all money received<br>
and disbursed and shall send promptly, at the time established by the<br>
conference, all tithes and offerings, other than funds collected for local<br>
purposes, to the conference treasurer, who also is treasurer of the<br>
conference church.<br>
If the members of an organized company are members of the<br>
conference church, the company does not possess the right to administer<br>
discipline or transfer or receive members. All such matters must be referred<br>
to the conference committee, which constitutes the board of the conference<br>
church. The conference president is the elder of the conference church.<br>
If the conference organizes a company through a neighboring mother<br>
church instead of through the conference church, the functions listed above (such as reporting and membership) would be cared for by/through the mother church.<br>
                                                      <br>
Since a company should want to grow and eventually be recognized as<br>
a church, its leadership should prepare members for church status by<br>
promoting all activities generally carried on by a church.<br>

should recommend such a course. In a duly called meeting, presided over by the conference president or the pastor or other ordained pastor, each church should vote on the question of union. When favorable action has been taken by both churches, a joint meeting of the two churches should be arranged, with the conference president presiding or in his absence an ordained pastor appointed by the conference.<br>
                                                      <br>
A carefully written statement of agreement should be prepared setting<br>
forth the reasons for uniting and stating any special matters or conditions<br>
involved, such as the disposal of property and responsibility for financial<br>
obligations. It should provide for the new name of the united church and for<br>
the release from service of all officers of the two churches.<br>
Adoption of the agreement by the united body consummates the union<br>
of the two churches. Members of the new congregation then should choose<br>
a nominating committee to nominate officers to serve for the remainder of<br>
the current year.<br>
A copy of the agreement should then be filed with the conference.<br>
The entire membership of both churches unites in the new organization.<br>
It is not permissible to remove any members by failing to include them in<br>
the membership list at the time of uniting. The united body becomes<br>
responsible for the order and discipline of all members. Members under<br>
discipline should be dealt with as provided elsewhere in this manual.<br>
All records of both churches become a part of the records of the united<br>
body. The local conference should be notified so that it may take suitable actions at its next session.<br>

sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He<br>
might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle<br>
or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. . . . For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church. For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones” (Eph. 5:25-30).<br>
                                                      <br>
This spirit should permeate all efforts to help an erring church and all<br>
aspects of any discipline that may be applied—always to help and save for<br>
the cause of God.<br>
Church status is not necessarily perpetual. A church may be dissolved<br>
or expelled from the sisterhood of churches for the following reasons:<br>
                                                      <br>
1. <strong><em>Loss of Members</em></strong>—Occasionally, despite efforts to preserve a<br>
church, so many members are lost by moving away or by death or by<br>
apostasy that the existence of the church is threatened. Under such<br>
circumstances the conference committee should recommend possible<br>
dissolution of the church.<br>
Before a church takes final action to dissolve, the remaining members<br>
shall be invited to transfer their memberships to other churches.<br>
If enough members remain, the congregation may call a business<br>
meeting, presided over by the conference president or by a pastor<br>
designated by him, to vote to approve letters requesting transfer of all<br>
members in regular standing to unite with other churches. In this way the<br>
church dissolves itself upon recommendation of the conference committee,<br>
and the way is opened for the conference committee to take action recording<br>
dissolution of the church.<br>
If, in the judgment of the conference committee, there are too few<br>
members available to call a business meeting, the conference committee<br>
shall have the authority to recommend transfer of members in regular<br>
standing to other churches or to the conference church. In this way the<br>
church is dissolved.<br>
If at the time of dissolution there are members who are under discipline<br>
and therefore cannot be granted letters saying they are in regular standing,<br>
their memberships shall be provisionally held in the conference church<br>
while conference administration ensures that every effort is made as soon as<br>
possible to help such members to a satisfactory Christian experience. If the<br>
efforts are successful, their memberships may then be confirmed in the<br>
conference church or letters granted to them for transfer to other churches.<br>
If they cannot be reclaimed, they should be removed from membership by<br>
vote of the conference committee.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. <strong><em>Discipline</em></strong>—Occasions for expelling churches for disciplinary<br>
reasons are rare because the mission of the church is to seek and to save.<br>
Where serious problems such as apostasy, refusal to operate in harmony<br>
with the <em>Church Manual</em>, or rebellion against the conference persist, earnest<br>
efforts should be made to avert the need for expulsion. The pastor should<br>
seek to deepen the spiritual life of the church through preaching and<br>
personal visitation ministries. The conference should encourage a series of<br>
revival meetings to lead the members to renew their covenant with their<br>
Lord. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the pastor, in cooperation with the<br>
conference committee, should counsel with the church and its leadership,<br>
seeking to bring healing and reconciliation and to preserve the church.<br>
Such remedial measures are preferable to permitting the deterioration<br>
of relationships, which could lead to expulsion of the church.<br>
However, if all efforts to preserve the church fail, the conference<br>
committee should give careful study to the question of expulsion. If such<br>
action is decided upon, the conference shall follow the following procedure:<br>
a. The decision to recommend expulsion, with supporting<br>
reasons, shall be presented to the church itself in a business meeting for its<br>
information and consideration.<br>
b. If the church does not accept the recommendation, it may<br>
respond in one of the following ways:<br>
1) Eliminating the causes for discipline and accepting the<br>
conference specifications, request the conference to rescind the<br>
recommendation to dissolve or expel.<br>
2) Appeal to the union executive committee, or to the<br>
division in case of a union of churches, to arbitrate on behalf of the church.<br>
c. If the church remains in rebellion, the conference executive<br>
committee makes a recommendation to a regular or specially called<br>
constituency meeting that the church be dissolved.<br>
d. If the constituency takes action to expel, the conference shall<br>
enforce the decision.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Care of Members, Records, and Funds</strong><br>
Loyal members of a dissolved or expelled church may desire to retain<br>
their memberships in the Church. To ensure their welfare, their<br>
memberships shall be provisionally held for up to one year in the<br>
conference church to allow opportunity for those who desire to have their<br>
memberships in the conference church confirmed or transferred to another<br>
church. Their standing shall be evaluated by the conference committee, and,<br>
if satisfactory, the conference committee may recommend them for<br>
membership in the conference church or churches of their choice.<br>
The names of members of a dissolved or expelled church who are<br>
under discipline shall be referred to the conference secretary for early<br>
attention by the conference committee as set out in “Loss of Members,”<br>
above.<br>
On dissolution or expulsion of a church for loss of members or for<br>
disciplinary reasons, all offerings, financial accounts, and all property real<br>
or personal, whether held in the name of the local church or the conference<br>
or other denominational legal association, are held in trust for the<br>
conference. The conference therefore has the right, the authority, and the<br>
duty to administer, protect, or dispose of such property and funds. All<br>
records of the church are to be held in the custody of the conference<br>
secretary and/or treasurer.<br>
In cases where discipline is not involved, an alternative to dissolving or<br>
expelling a church is to return it to company status. Such a decision will be<br>
made by a majority vote of the conference committee, following<br>
consultation with the district pastor and members, and conveyed to the<br>
church by the pastor or conference representative.<br>
At a business meeting (see pp. 40, 41), letters of transfer may be voted<br>
to all remaining members in regular standing to the conference church or to<br>
other churches in the cases of any members who wish to transfer. At the<br>
same meeting, the pastor, in counsel with the local members, shall appoint from the members of the new company a leadership team, including a leader, a clerk, and a treasurer. For details of other organizational matters relating to a company, see “Organizing a Company” on pp. 37, 38.<br>

impressed on everyone desiring Church membership. Only those giving<br>
evidence of having experienced the new birth and enjoying a spiritual<br>
experience in the Lord Jesus are prepared for acceptance into membership. <br>
                                                      <br>
Pastors must instruct candidates in the fundamental teachings and related practices of the Church so they will enter the Church on a sound spiritual basis. While there is no stated age for baptism, it is recommended that very young children who express a desire to be baptized should be encouraged and entered into an instruction program that may lead to baptism.<br>
The apostle Paul writes: “Or do you not know that as many of us as<br>
were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we<br>
were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was<br>
raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk<br>
in newness of life” (Rom. 6:3, 4).<br>
Luke also reports: “Then Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and let every one<br>
of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.’ . . . Then those who gladly<br>
received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls<br>
were added to them” (Acts 2:38-41).<br>
“The members of the church, those whom He has called out of darkness<br>
into His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory. The church is the<br>
repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church will<br>
eventually be made manifest, even to ‘the principalities and powers in<br>
heavenly places,’ the final and full display of the love of God.”—AA 9.<br>

of entrance to His spiritual kingdom. He has made this a positive condition with which all must comply who wish to be acknowledged as under the authority of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. . . .<br>
“Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who are<br>
baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, at<br>
the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that they have<br>
forsaken the service of Satan and have become members of the royal<br>
family, children of the heavenly King. They have obeyed the command:<br>
‘Come out from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the<br>
unclean thing.’ And to them is fulfilled the promise: ‘I will receive you, and<br>
will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the<br>
Lord Almighty.’ 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.”—6T 91.<br>
Baptism is the avenue of induction into the Church. It is fundamentally<br>
the pledge of entrance into Christ’s saving covenant and should be treated<br>
as a solemn and yet joyful welcome into the family of God.<br>
Membership in the Church is possible only in those churches included<br>
in the sisterhood of churches recognized by a conference.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Mode of Baptism</em></strong>—The Church believes in baptism by immersion and<br>
accepts into membership only those who have been baptized in this manner.<br>
(See Chapter 14, “Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists.”) Those<br>
who acknowledge their lost state as sinners, sincerely repent of their sins,<br>
and experience conversion may, after proper instruction, be accepted as<br>
candidates for baptism and Church membership.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Thorough Instruction and Public Examination Before Baptism</em></strong>—<br>
Candidates individually or in a baptismal class should be instructed from<br>
the Scriptures regarding the Church’s fundamental beliefs and practices and<br>
the responsibilities of membership. A pastor should satisfy the church by a<br>
public examination that candidates are well instructed, are committed to<br>
taking this important step, and by practice and conduct demonstrate a<br>
willing acceptance of Church doctrines and the principles of conduct which<br>
are the outward expression of those doctrines, for “by their fruits you will<br>
know them” (Matt. 7:20).<br>
If public examination is impractical, then candidates should be<br>
examined by the board or a committee appointed by the board, such as the<br>
board of elders, whose report then should be given to the church before the<br>
baptism.<br>
“The test of discipleship is not brought to bear as closely as it should be<br>
upon those who present themselves for baptism. It should be understood<br>
whether they are simply taking the name of Seventh-day Adventists, or<br>
whether they are taking their stand on the Lord’s side, to come out from the<br>
world and be separate, and touch not the unclean thing. Before baptism<br>
there should be a thorough inquiry as to the experience of the candidates.<br>
                                                      <br>
Let this inquiry be made, not in a cold and distant way, but kindly, tenderly, pointing the new converts to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. Bring the requirements of the gospel to bear upon the candidates for baptism.”—6T 95, 96.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Baptismal Covenant</em></strong>—The Church has adopted its 28 fundamental<br>
beliefs, together with the baptismal vow and Certificate of Baptism and<br>

A printed copy of this covenant, with the Certificate of Baptism and<br>
Commitment properly completed, should be given to all accepted into<br>
membership by baptism. An appropriate certificate also should be given<br>
those accepted on profession of faith.<br>
The Certificate of Baptism and Commitment contains a space for the<br>
new member to sign as an affirmation of commitment. Following the<br>
baptism, the Certificate of Baptism and Commitment should be presented to<br>

baptism of converts, an evangelist should invite the pastor or elder to visit<br>
the baptismal class to become acquainted with the candidates. Such contacts<br>
will enable the church to be better prepared to receive the new members.<br>

should make necessary preparations and also assist male candidates into and<br>
out of the water. The deaconesses should assist female candidates.<br>
Care should be exercised to see that proper attire is provided for the<br>
candidates, preferably robes of suitable heavy material. If robes are not<br>
available, the candidates should dress in modest attire.<br>
The baptism should be followed by a short welcoming ceremony.<br>

                                                      <strong>Rebaptism</strong><br>
Rebaptism is specifically mentioned only in Acts 19:1-7, where the<br>
apostle Paul endorsed it for a group of believers whose previous baptism of<br>
repentance had been by John. In addition to repentance, Christian baptism is<br>
associated with an understanding of and personal commitment to the gospel<br>
and the teachings of Jesus and a reception of the Holy Spirit. With this<br>
increased understanding and commitment, rebaptism is acceptable.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Individuals From Other Christian Communions</em></strong>—On biblical<br>
grounds, individuals from other Christian communions who have embraced<br>
Seventh- day Adventist beliefs and who have previously been baptized by<br>
immersion may request rebaptism.<br>
The following examples, however, suggest that rebaptism may not be<br>
required. Evidently the instance of Acts 19 was a special one, for Apollos is<br>
reported to have received John’s baptism (Acts 18:25), and there is no<br>
record that he was rebaptized. Apparently some of the apostles themselves<br>
received John’s baptism (John 1:35-40), but there is no record they were<br>
rebaptized.<br>
If a new believer has accepted significant new truths, Ellen G. White<br>
supports rebaptism as the Spirit leads the new believer to request it. This<br>
follows the developmental pattern of Acts 19. An individual who has<br>
previously experienced baptism by immersion should evaluate his/her new<br>
religious experience and determine whether he/she desires rebaptism. There<br>
is to be no urging.<br>
“This [rebaptism] is a subject which each individual must<br>
conscientiously take his position upon in the fear of God. This subject<br>
should be carefully presented in the spirit of tenderness and love. Then the<br>
duty of urging belongs to no one but God; give God a chance to work with<br>
His Holy Spirit upon the minds, so that the individual will be perfectly<br>
convinced and satisfied in regard to this advanced step.”—Ev 373.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Apostasy and Rebaptism</em></strong>—Although apostasy existed in the<br>
apostolic church (Heb. 6:4-6), Scripture does not address the question of<br>
rebaptism. Ellen G. White supports rebaptism when members have<br>
apostatized and then are reconverted and wish to rejoin the Church.<br>
(See pp. 66, 67, 154.)<br>

“The Lord calls for a decided reformation. And when a soul is truly<br>
reconverted, let him be rebaptized. Let him renew his covenant with God,<br>
and God will renew His covenant with him.”—Ev 375.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Inappropriate Rebaptism</em></strong>—On the basis of biblical teaching and the<br>
guidance of Ellen G. White, rebaptism should occur only in special<br>
circumstances and should be relatively rare. To administer baptism<br>
repeatedly or on an emotional basis lessens its meaning and represents a<br>
misunderstanding of the gravity and significance that Scripture assigns to it.<br>
A member whose spiritual experience has become cold needs a spirit of<br>
repentance which leads to revival and reformation. This experience will be<br>
followed by participation in the communion service to signify renewed<br>
cleansing and fellowship in the body of Christ, making rebaptism<br>
unnecessary.<br>

                                                      <strong>Profession of Faith</strong><br>
Individuals who have accepted the fundamental beliefs of the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church and who desire membership in the Church<br>
on profession of faith may be accepted under any of the following four<br>
circumstances:<br>
1. A committed Christian coming from another Christian communion<br>
who has already been baptized by immersion as practiced by the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church. (See p. 44.)<br>
2. A member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who, because of<br>
world conditions, is unable to secure a letter of transfer from his/her home<br>
church. (See p. 53.)<br>
3. A member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church whose request for<br>
membership transfer has received no response from the church where he/she<br>
is a member. In such a case the church shall seek assistance of the<br>
conference or conferences involved.<br>
4. An individual who has been a member, but whose membership has<br>
been misplaced or has been withdrawn because he/she was a missing<br>
member, yet who has remained faithful to his/her Christian commitment.<br>
Great care should be exercised in receiving members if they have<br>
formerly been members of another congregation. When a person applies for<br>
membership on profession of faith, inquiries should be made concerning the<br>
applicant’s former experience. Church officers should seek the advice and<br>
help of the conference president. Sufficient time should be taken to<br>
investigate the facts.<br>
                                                      <em>MEMBERSHIP 51</em><br>
When a person applies for membership on profession of faith and it is<br>
found that he/she still is a member of another congregation, no steps should<br>
be taken to receive that person into membership until the church holding the<br>
membership grants a letter of transfer. If, after the process of transfer is<br>
followed (see pp. 51, 52), a church refuses to grant a letter of transfer and<br>
the member feels the letter has been unjustly denied, the member may<br>
appeal to the conference committee. Following this procedure will result in<br>
a higher appreciation of the sacredness of Church membership and in<br>
wrongs being made right. No church has the right to withhold transfer<br>
unless the person is under discipline.<br>
When an individual whose membership has been removed seeks<br>
readmission to church membership, readmission is normally preceded by<br>
rebaptism. (See pp. 67, 68.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Transferring Members</strong><br>
When members move to a different area, the clerk of the church<br>
holding their membership records should write to the secretary of the<br>
relevant conference requesting that a pastor in the new locality visit them<br>
and help facilitate their membership transfer to the new congregation.<br>
The clerk of the church holding the membership records also should<br>
notify the transferring members of the intention to give their new addresses<br>
to the conference.<br>
Members who move to another locality for longer than six months<br>
should make immediate applications for letters of transfer. Members<br>
moving to an isolated area with no church within a reasonable distance<br>
should apply to join the conference church.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Method of Granting Letters of Transfer</em></strong>—Members should apply<br>
for their letters of transfer to the clerk of the church with which the<br>
members desire to unite (the receiving church). That clerk sends the request<br>
to the clerk of the church from which the members desire to transfer (the<br>
granting church). (For alternative method, see p. 52.)<br>
When the clerk of the granting church receives the request, the clerk<br>
brings it to the pastor or elder, who in turn presents it to the board. After<br>
due consideration, the board votes to recommend, favorably or otherwise, to<br>
the church. (See pp. 36-38, 40, 49-55, 65-68, 82.) The pastor or elder then<br>
brings the recommendation to the attention of the church for a first reading.<br>
Final action is taken the following week, when the request is presented to<br>
the church for a vote.<br>
The purpose of the one-week interval is to give members an<br>
opportunity to object to the granting of the letter. Objections ordinarily<br>
should not be publicly stated but be lodged with the pastor or elder, who<br>
then refers them to the board for consideration. The board should give each<br>
objector opportunity to appear to present his/her objection. If the objection<br>
is not based on valid grounds, the person raising objection should be<br>
admonished to withdraw it. If the objection is based on valid grounds, it is<br>
the duty of the board to investigate. Final action on granting the letter is<br>
deferred until the matter has been satisfactorily settled.<br>
If the objection involves personal relationships, every effort should be<br>
made to effect reconciliation. If public offenses are involved, disciplinary<br>
measures may be called for. If there is some spiritual lapse, efforts should<br>
be made to restore the member.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Clerk to Prepare Letter</em></strong>—When the church has granted the letter of<br>
transfer, the clerk fills out the regular transfer form and forwards it to the<br>
clerk of the receiving church. The clerk of the receiving church then passes<br>
the letter to the pastor or elder, who presents it first to the board for<br>
recommendation, after which the request is presented to the church at its<br>
next regular service. The vote accepting the person into membership usually<br>
is taken at the regular service one week later. The clerk of the receiving<br>
church then adds the member’s name and date of admittance to the<br>
membership record. The clerk also fills out the return portion of the letter of<br>
transfer, certifying that the member has been accepted, and returns it to the<br>
clerk of the granting church. (See p. 82.)<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Letter Valid Six Months</em></strong>—A letter of transfer is valid for six months<br>
from date of issue.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Alternative Method for Membership Transfer</em></strong>—A division may<br>
approve alternative methods for transferring members between churches<br>
within the division, but when members request transfers to a church in<br>
another division, the above “Method of Granting Letters of Transfer” must<br>
be followed.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Membership During Transfer</em></strong>—Under no circumstances shall the<br>
clerk of the granting church remove a member’s name from the membership<br>
record until the return portion of the transfer letter has been received,<br>
certifying that the member has been voted into the fellowship of the<br>
receiving church. To do so deprives the person of membership during the<br>
transfer. The clerk, the elders, the pastor, and the conference president are<br>
all responsible for seeing that all churches adhere to this procedure.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Receiving Members Under Difficult Conditions</em></strong>—World conditions<br>
sometimes prevent communications concerning a membership transfer. In<br>
such situations, the receiving church, in counsel with the conference, should<br>
satisfy itself as to the applicant’s standing and then receive him/her into<br>
membership on profession of faith. If the way later opens to communicate<br>
with the granting church or to the conference where it is located, the<br>
receiving church should send a letter stating what it has done.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Counted in Statistical Reports</em></strong>—When quarterly and annual<br>
statistical reports are made, a member to whom a letter has been granted,<br>
but whose return certificate has not been received, is counted as a member<br>
of the granting church. When the return certificate has been received, the<br>
name is then removed from the membership record of the granting church<br>
and not included in subsequent reports.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>If Member Is Not Accepted</em></strong>—The receiving church must receive the<br>
member unless it knows a valid reason it should not extend the privilege of<br>
membership. If a church does not receive the member, the clerk should<br>
return the letter to the granting church with a full explanation of the reasons.<br>
The person’s membership then remains with the granting church, which<br>
should cooperate with the member to resolve the matter.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Letters Granted Only to Those in Regular Standing</em></strong>—Letters of<br>
transfer are granted only to members in regular standing, never to a member<br>
under discipline. Qualifying statements are out of order except when the<br>
pastor or board of the granting church has factual or proven knowledge that<br>
the member has been involved as a perpetrator of child abuse. In that case,<br>
for the safety of children, the pastor or elder should provide a confidential<br>
statement alerting the pastor or elder of the congregation to which the<br>
member is transferring.<br>
If a member who has moved to a new location has grown indifferent,<br>
the pastor or elder of the granting church may, to be clear in the matter<br>
before the transfer is granted, take up the question with the pastor or elder<br>
of the receiving church.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>No Letter Without Member’s Approval</em></strong>—In no case should a church<br>
vote a letter of transfer contrary to the desire of the member, nor should a<br>
                                                      <em>54 CHURCH MANUAL</em><br>
church accept a member by a letter granted under such circumstances.<br>
Membership is the personal relationship of an individual to the body of<br>
Christ, and a church should recognize this relationship and avoid any action<br>
that might be construed as arbitrary.<br>
On the other hand, a member is under obligation to recognize the<br>
welfare of the church and to make every effort to relieve the church of<br>
problems incident to absentee members. When a member moves, he/she<br>
should promptly request a letter of transfer.<br>
When a church is expelled from the sisterhood of churches by action of<br>
a conference session, the memberships of all loyal members, except those<br>
who refuse, are considered moved to the conference church on a provisional<br>
basis. The conference church then may issue letters of transfer for loyal<br>
members and deal with other memberships as may be necessary. (See<br>
pp. 39-42.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Church Board Cannot Grant Letters</em></strong>—A board has no authority to<br>
vote letters of transfer or to receive members by letter. The board’s<br>
authority is limited to making recommendations to the church. Action on all<br>
transfers of membership, favorable or otherwise, must be taken by the<br>
church. (See pp. 51, 52.) The clerk has no authority to remove names from<br>
or add names to the membership record except by vote of the church, unless<br>
a member requests in writing to be removed from church membership, in<br>
which case the church board must act on the request. Efforts should be<br>
made to restore the individual to the church family. When a member dies,<br>
the clerk records the date of death in the membership record, and no action<br>
by the church is necessary.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Membership in the Conference Church</em></strong>—Isolated members should<br>
unite with the conference church, which is a body organized for the benefit<br>
of believers who otherwise would be without church privileges. Aged and<br>
infirmed members who live near a church and conference officers and other<br>
employees, including pastors, should be members of a local church, not the<br>
conference church.<br>
The conference president is the presiding elder of the conference<br>
church, and the work normally carried by the clerk and the treasurer is<br>
handled by the conference secretary and treasurer. Since the church has no<br>
board, all business normally conducted by a local church board is conducted<br>
by the conference committee, which also appoints delegates from the<br>
conference church to the conference session.<br>
                                                      <strong><em><br>
Membership Record</em></strong>—The church should have one membership<br>
record. Names are added or removed only on the vote of the church or at<br>
death. (See pp. 81, 82.) Under no circumstances should a church keep a retired membership list.<br>

Jim once asked an atheist if he had ever wrestled, even for a few moments, with the thought that maybe God does exist.<br>
“Absolutely!” the atheist said, to Jim’s surprise. “Years ago when our first child was born I almost became a believer in God. As I looked down at that miniature-but-perfect little human being in the crib, as I watched the flexing of those tiny fingers and saw the dawning of recognition in those little eyes, I went through a period of several months during which I almost ceased to be an atheist. Looking at that child almost convinced me there had to be a God.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The design of the human body demands the existence of a designer. Scientists tell us that the brain stores and remembers thousands of mental images, integrates and solves problems, appreciates beauty, comprehends self, and desires to develop the best in each person. Electrical charges originating from the brain control all the muscular activity of our bodies.<br>
Computers also function through electrical impulses. But it took a human mind to invent the computer and a human being to build the computer and tell it what to do.<br>
No wonder the psalmist concluded that the human body speaks loud and clear of a wonderful Creator:<br>
“I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.”-Psalms 139:14. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
We don’t have to go far to find the “works” of God. The intricate design of the human brain and the other organs of our body are the “works” of God, and point to an infinitely skillful designer.<br>
No pump built by man can compare with the human heart. No computer network can equal our nervous system. No television system is as efficient as the human voice, ear, and eye. No central air conditioning and heating system can match the work done by our nose, lungs, and skin. The complexity of the human body suggests that someone designed it, and that Someone is God.<br>
The human body is a complete system of organs-all are interrelated, all thoroughly designed. The lungs and heart, nerves and muscles, all perform incredibly complicated tasks that depend on other incredibly complicated tasks.<br>
If you were to mark ten coins from one to ten, put them in your pocket, shake them around, and then pull them out and put them back in your pocket one by one, what is the likelihood you could do so in exact numerical sequence? By mathematical law you have only one chance in ten billion of taking them out in order from one to ten.<br>
Now consider the chances of a stomach, brain, heart, liver, arteries, veins, kidneys, ears, eyes, and teeth all developing together and beginning to function at the same moment in time.<br>
What is the most reasonable explanation for the design of the human body?<br>
“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,’… SO GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE… male and female he created them.”-Genesis 1:26, 27.<br>
The first man and woman could not just have happened. The Bible affirms that God designed us in His image. He thought us up and brought us into being.<br>

But evidence for God is not confined to the design of our bodies; it’s also spread across the heavens. Leave the lights of the city, and look up into the night sky. That milky cloud beyond the stars that we call the Milky Way is really a galaxy of billions of blazing suns similar to our sun. In fact, our sun and its planets are a part of the Milky Way. And our Milky Way is but one of an estimated more than one hundred billion galaxies that can be seen through giant telescopes on earth and through the Hubble telescope in space.<br>
No wonder the psalmist concluded that the stars speak of a glorious Maker:<br>
“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.”-Psalms 19:1-3.<br>
What may we reasonably conclude by looking at the intricate design and vast size of the universe?<br>
“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” - Genesis 1:1<br>
“[God] is before all things, and in him all things hold together.” - Colossians 1:17.<br>
All creation testifies about God the Master Designer and Infinite Creator. In the simple words, “in the beginning God”, we find the answer to the mystery of life. There is a God who created everything.<br>
Many great scientific minds today believe in God. Dr. Arthur Compton, Nobel Prize-winning physicist, commenting on this verse of Scripture, once said:<br>
“For myself, faith begins with a realization that a supreme intelligence brought the universe into being and created man. It is not difficult for me to have this faith, for it is plain that where there is a plan there is a divine intelligence. An orderly, unfolding universe testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered- ‘In the beginning God.’”<br>
The Bible does not attempt to prove God-it declares His existence. Dr. Arthur Conklin, a noted biologist, once wrote: “The probability of life originating from an accident is comparable to the probability of an unabridged dictionary resulting from an explosion in a print shop.”<br>
We know that human beings can’t make something from nothing. We may build things, invent things, put things together, but we have never brought into being from scratch even the tiniest frog or the simplest flower. The things about us cry out that God designed, God created, God sustains. The only believable answer to the origin of the universe, this world, and human beings-is God.<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The God who designed the starry heavens, who created the universe, seeks a personal relationship with us. He had a personal relationship with Moses: “The Lord would speak to Moses…as a man speaks with his friends” (Exodus 33:11). And God wants to enter into a personal relationship with you and become your friend. Jesus promised those who follow Him: “You are my friends” (John 15:14)<br>
We have all wrestled with the idea of God, for humans are naturally religious. No animal ever builds an altar for worship. Yet everywhere you find men and women, you find them worshiping. Deep within every human heart is a natural desire to worship, an awareness of God, a desire to become a friend of God. When we respond to our longing and find God, there is no longer a doubt about His existence and our need.<br>
During the 1990s millions of atheists in Russia renounced atheism and turned to God. A university professor in St. Petersburg made a statement that typifies the comments made by many transformed atheists in the former Soviet Union:<br>
“I have searched for a meaning to life in my scientific research, but found nothing to have confidence in. The scientists around me have the same empty feeling. As I looked at the vastness of the universe in my study of astronomy, and the emptiness of my soul, I felt there must be some meaning. Then, when I received the Bible you gave me and began reading it, the vacuum in my life was filled. I have found the Bible to be the only source of confidence to my soul. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior and have found true peace and satisfaction in life.”<br>
A Christian believes in God because he or she has met Him and discovers that He satisfies the heart’s deepest needs. The God whom Christians have joyfully found to exist, gives us a new perspective, new meaning, new motives, and new joys.<br>
God doesn’t promise a life free from trouble and conflict, but He does assure us that He will guide and sustain us if we come into a personal relationship with Him. And millions of Christians will testify that they would give up everything rather than go back to a life without God.<br>
This is the greatest wonder of all-that the Almighty God who designed, created, and sustains the universe also desires a personal relationship with every man and woman, boy and girl. David marveled at this, when he wrote:<br>
“When I consider heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of Him?”-Psalms 8:3, 4.<br>
Our Creator is “mindful” of each one of us. He takes a personal interest in you as if you were the only one being He had created.<br>
So we can believe in God: (1) Because of the intricate design in everything He created about us. (2) Because of the longing for God within us that leaves us restless till we find our rest in Him. And, (3) Because when we seek and find Him, God satisfies our every need and longing-to the full!<br>

It is only reasonable that a personal God would want to reveal Himself to His created beings just as a father desires that his children know him. And in the Bible God tells us who He is and what He is like.<br>
What pattern did God use for creating men and women?<br>
“So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him.” - Genesis 1:27.<br>
Since we are made in God’s image, our abilities to reflect and feel, to remember and hope, to ponder and analyze-all are derived from Him. <br>
What is God’s dominant trait?<br>
“God is love.” - 1 John 4:8.<br>
God relates to human beings out of His own heart of love. There is nothing He has done or ever will do which is not motivated by a selfless, sacrificial love.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
In the Bible God repeatedly speaks of Himself as a father.<br>
“Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us? - Malachi 2:10.<br>
Some of the father images we see today are anything but desirable. There are neglectful dads, abusive dads. God is not like that. He is a caring, sensitive Father. He is the kind of Dad who loves to play games with his son or daughter, the kind of Dad who charms his kids by telling wonderful bedtime stories.<br>
Our loving Father wanted to do more than reveal Himself through the words of Scripture. He knew that a person we live with is much more real to us than someone we only hear about or read about in a book. So He came to our world as a real person-the person of Jesus.<br>
“[Jesus] is the image of the invisible God.”-Colossians 1:15.<br>
So if you have seen Jesus, you have seen God. He came down on our Level-He became like us-so He could teach us how to live and be happy, and so we could see what God is really like. Jesus is God made visible. He Himself said, “Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father” (John 14:9).<br>
As you read the story of Jesus in the four Gospels, the first four books of the New Testament, you will discover a fascinating portrait of our heavenly Father. Rough Fishermen dropped their nets to follow Christ, and small children flocked to receive His blessings. He could comfort the most devastated sinner and disarm the most self-righteous hypocrite. He healed everything from blindness to leprosy. In all His actions Jesus demonstrated that God is love! He met human need in a way no one had ever done before Him-or has since!<br>
Jesus’ final glorious revelation of what God is like happened at the cross.<br>
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”-John 3:16.<br>
Jesus died not only to give us a happier life now, but also to give us eternal life. For long ages people wondered, and hoped, and dreamed about God. They saw His handiwork in the sky and in the beauties of nature. Then at the cross, Jesus broke the silence of the ages, and people found themselves looking into the very face of God, seeing Him as He really is-love, eternal and immortal love!<br>
You can discover God right now as Jesus reveals Him. That discovery will lead you to make a very personal affirmation: “Father, I love you!”<br>

The famous mutineers who sank the British ship Bounty ended up settling with their native women on the lonely island of Pitcairn in the South Pacific. The group consisted of nine British sailors, six Tahitian men, ten Tahitian women, and a girl of fifteen. One of the sailors discovered how to distill alcohol, and soon drunkenness corrupted the island colony. Fighting among the men and women grew into violent exchanges.<br>
After a while only one of the original men who reached the island survived. But this man, Alexander Smith, discovered a Bible in one of the chests taken from the ship. He began to read it and to teach the others what is said. As he did so his own life changed, and finally the lives of all on the island.<br>
The islanders were completely isolated from the outside world until the arrival of the United States ship Topaz in 1808. Its crew found the island a thriving, prosperous community with no whisky, no jail, no crime. The Bible had changed the island from a hell on earth to an example of what God wants the world to be. And so it remains today.<br>
Does God still speak to people through the pages of the Bible? He certainly does. As I write this, I’m looking at the answer sheet sent to us by a student of one of our Bible courses. A note at a bottom states, “I am in prison, on death row, sentenced to die for a crime. Before I took this Bible courses, I was lost, but now I have something to look forward to, and I have found a new love.”<br>
The Bible possesses a power that can actually transform people’s lives. When people really begin to study the Bible, lives are dramatically changed.<br>

After creating Adam and Eve, the first man and woman on earth, God spoke to them face-to-face. But when God came to visit them after they sinned, what did the couple do?<br>
“The man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and THEY HID FROM THE LORD GOD among the trees of the garden.”-Genesis 3:8 (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Sin interrupted face-to-face contact with God.<br>
After sin came to our world, how did God communicate with people? <br>
“Surely the sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.”-Amos 3:7.<br>
God has not left us in the dark about life and its meaning. Through His prophets-persons God called to speak and write for Him-He has revealed His answers to life’s great questions.<br>

The prophets gave God’s messages by voice and pen while they lived, and when they died, their writings lived after them. These prophetic messages were then gathered together, under God’s leading, in the book we call the Bible.<br>
But how reliable are their writings?<br>
“You must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation. For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”-2 Peter 1:20, 21.<br>
The writers of the Bible wrote not according to their own will or desire, but only as they were moved, or inspired by the Spirit of God. The Bible is God’s own Book!<br>
In the Bible God tells us about Himself and reveals His purposes for the human race. It shows God’s view of the past, and also opens up the future, telling us how the problem of evil will finally be resolved and how peace will come to our world.<br>
Is all the Bible a message from God?<br>
“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”-2 Timothy 3:16, 17.<br>
The Holy Bible affects human beings so profoundly because “all” the Bible is “God-breathed,” an inspired document, God’s Book. The prophets related what they saw and heard in human language, but their message came directly from God. So if you want to know what life is all about, read the Holy Scriptures. Reading the Bible will transform your life. The more you prayerfully read it, the more peace of mind you’ll experience.<br>
The same Holy Spirit who inspired the prophets to write the Bible, will make the Bible’s teachings, its gospel, effective in transforming your life if you invite the Spirit to be present as you read the Bible.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The Bible is actually a library of 66 books. The 39 books of the Old Testament were composed from about 1450 B.C. to about 400 B.C., the 27 books of the New Testament between A.D. 50 and A.D. 100.<br>
The prophet Moses began the first five books of the Bible sometime before 1400 B.C. The apostle John penned the last book of the Bible, Revelation, about A.D. 95. During the 1,500 years between the writing of the first and last books of the Bible, at least 38 other inspired writers made their contributions. Some were businessmen, others shepherds, fishermen, soldiers, physicians, preachers, kings-human beings from all walks of life. They often lived within contrasting cultures and philosophies.<br>
But here is the wonder of it all: When the 66 books of the Bible with their 1,189 chapters made up of 31,173 verses are brought together, we find perfect unity and harmony in the message they convey. <br>
Suppose a man should knock at your door and, when invited in, place an oddly shaped piece of marble on your living room floor, then leave without a word. Other visitors follow in succession until about 40 individuals have each deposited their numbered marble piece into place.<br>
When the last one has gone, you see with surprise that a beautiful statue stands before you. Then you learn that most of the “sculptures” had never met each other, coming, as they did, from South America, China, Russia, Africa, and other parts of the world. What would you have to conclude? That someone had planned the statue and had sent to each man accurate specifications for his particular piece of marble.<br>
The Bible as a whole communicates one coherent message-just like a perfect marble statue. One mind planned it all, the mind of God. Scripture’s remarkable unity gives evidence that though human beings wrote down the thoughts, they were inspired by God.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
(1) The preservation of the Bible is remarkable. All of the early manuscripts of the Bible were copied by hand-long before there were printing presses. Scribes made copies of the original manuscripts and distributed them. Thousands of copies of such manuscripts or portions of them still survive.<br>
Hebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament that go back 150 to 200 years before Christ were found near the Dead Sea in 1947. It’s amazing that these two-thousand year-old scrolls contain exactly the same truth as we find in the Old Testament of Bibles printed today. This is powerful evidence of how reliable God’s Word is.<br>
                                                      <br>
The apostles first wrote much of the New Testament as letters they sent to Christian churches established after the death and resurrection of Christ. More than 4,500 manuscripts of all or a part of the New Testament are on display in the great museums and libraries of Europe and America. Some of them date back to the second century. By comparing these early manuscripts with today’s Bible, we can readily see that the New Testament has also remained essentially unchanged since it was first written.<br>
Today the Bible or portions of it have been translated into over 2,060 languages and dialects. It is world’s best-seller: over 150 million Bibles and Bible portions are sold each year.<br>
(2) The historical accuracy of the Bible is remarkable. Many archaeological discoveries have dramatically confirmed the accuracy of the Bible. Historians have discovered clay tablets and stone monuments which have brought to light names, places, and events previously known only from the Bible.<br>
For example, according to Genesis 11:31, Abraham and his family “set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to [the land of] Canaan.” Because only the Bible spoke of Ur, certain scholars stated that no such city had ever existed. Then archaeologists uncovered a temple tower in southern Iraq with a cylinder at the base written in cuneiform that contained the name Ur. Later finds revealed Ur as the thriving metropolis of a highly developed civilization. That city’s identity had been forgotten, only the Bible preserved its name-until the spade of the archaeologist confirmed its authenticity. And Ur is only one of many examples of archaeology confirming the accuracy of the Bible.<br>
(3) The accurate fulfillment of Bible predictions shows that you can trust the Bible. Scripture contains many remarkable predictions of future events now being fulfilled before our eyes. We examine some of these exciting prophecies in future lessons.<br>

As you explore God’s Word, keep these principles in mind:<br>
(1) Study the Bible with a prayerful heart. If you approach Scripture with a heart and mind opened through prayer, it becomes a personal contact with Jesus (John 16:13-14).<br>
(2) Read the Bible daily. Daily Bible study is a key to power in our lives, an encounter with the mind of God (Romans 1:16).<br>
(3) As you read it, let the Bible speak for itself. Ask: what did the Bible writer intend to say? By grasping what a text means we can apply it intelligently to our life today.<br>
(4) Study the Bible by subject. Compare scripture with scripture. Jesus used this method to prove that He was the Messiah:<br>
“And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in ALL the Scriptures concerning himself.”-Luke 24:27.<br>
By putting together all that the Bible has to say on a certain subject we gain a balanced perspective.<br>
(5) Study the Bible to receive power to live for Christ. The Word of God is described in Hebrew 4:12 as a sharp, double-edged sword. It’s more than words on a page, it’s a living weapon in our hands to fight off temptations to sin.<br>
(6) Listen as God speaks to you through His Word. If a person is to know the Bible truth about a certain subject, he or she must be willing to follow what it teaches (John 7:17), not what some person thinks, or what some church teaching asserts.<br>

“The unforgiving of [God’s] words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.”-Psalms 119:130<br>
Studying the Bible will strengthen your “understanding” give you the strength to overcome destructive habits, and enable you to develop physically, mentally, morally, and spiritually.<br>
The Bible speaks to the heart. It deals with the experiences of humanity- birth, love, marriage, parenthood, and death. It heals the deepest wound in human nature, sin and the misery resulting from it.<br>
God’s Word is not a book of one race, one age, one nation, or one culture. Although written in the East, it also appeals to men and women in the West. It enters the homes of the humble and the mansions of the wealthy. Children love its exciting stories. Its heroes inspire young people. The sick, the lonely, and the aged discover in it comfort and hope for a better life. <br>
Because God works through the Bible, it has great power. It breaks even hearts hardened against all human emotion, softening and filling them with love. We have seen the Bible change a former bandit and opium smoker into a zealous preacher. We have seen the Bible turn a liar and a cheat into an honest and upright teacher. And we have seen this Book snatch people from the brink of suicide and give them a hopeful new beginning. The Bible awakens love among enemies. It makes the proud humble and the selfish generous. The Bible strengthens us in weakness, cheers us in despondency, comforts us in sorrow, guides us in uncertainty, and soothes us when weary. It shows us how to love courageously and how to die without fear. <br>
God’s Book, the Bible, can change your life! You’ll see that more and more clearly as you continue studying the DISCOVER guides.<br>
Why was the Bible written for us? Jesus answers:<br>
“But these [Bible truth] are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that by believing you may have life in his name.”-John 20:31<br>
The greatest reason we should become acquainted with the Holy Scriptures is that it is full of pictures that reveal Jesus Christ and assure us of eternal life. By looking at Christ throughout the Bible, we are changed and become more like Him. So why not begin now to discover the power of God’s Word that can make you more like Jesus?<br>

Some mornings, the world seems a paradise. You wake up, take a deep breath by the window, and look out on golden sunshine reflecting on the trees, leaf by leaf. Some moments make life seem so precious: the face of a beloved friend as you say good-bye, a sublime piece of music that perfectly matches your mood, the unexpected affection of a small child.<br>
But other mornings, the world seems a place of horror. You wake up to newspaper headlines screaming about yet another terrorist bombing that maimed or blinded a child, yet another serial killer claiming his tenth victim, yet another famine or flood or war or earthquake. These are moments when nothing makes sense, nothing seems fair.<br>
What does it all mean? Can we make sense of our wonderful and terrible world? Why are we here? Does my life really matter to God or am I just a minor cog in some vast cosmic machine?<br>

God is the Creator, the architect and designer of everything from supernovas to butterfly wings.<br>
“By the word of the Lord were the heavens made-their starry host by the breath of his mouth…. For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.”-Psalm 33:6-9 (Unless otherwise noted all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
God has only to speak and the elements obey His will.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
“In six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it Holy.”-Exodus 20:11<br>
The eternal, all-powerful Creator could have formed the world in a moment “by the breath of His mouth.” But God chose to take six days to do it-six minutes, or even six seconds would have been sufficient. The first chapter in the Bible, Genesis 1, describes what God created on each day of the creation week.<br>
What crowning masterpiece did God create on the sixth day?<br>
“GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE, in the image of God he created him; MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM.”-Genesis 1:27.<br>
God decided to create individuals like Himself who could reason and feel and love. Every person is made in God’s “image.”<br>
By the sixth day, the world was filled with plants and animals, and then God introduced His masterpiece of creation. According to Genesis 2:7, the Almighty formed Adam’s body from the dust of the ground. So when God breathed “the breath of life” into his nostrils, man became “a living being”-that is, he came to life. God named the first man created in His image, Adam, a word that simply means “man,” and the first woman, Eve, which means “living” (2:20; 3:20). A loving Creator saw the need for human companionship.<br>
Fresh from the hand of God, Adam and Eve both reflected His image. God could have programmed beings like robots to wander contentedly about the Garden of Eden and raise their voices in adoration to Him. But God wanted more: real relationships. Robots can smile, speak, even do the dishes, but they can’t love.<br>
God created us in His image, with the capacity to think and choose, and to remember, understand, and love. Adam and Eve were God’s children, and inexpressibly dear to Him.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Adam and Eve had everything to make them happy. They enjoyed perfect physical and mental health, living in a beautiful garden home in a flawless world (Genesis 2:8; 1:28-31). God promised them children and the ability to do creative thinking, and to find satisfaction in the work of their hands (Genesis 1:28; 2:15). They experienced face-to-face fellowship with their Maker. No trace of worry, fear, or sickness marred their blissful days.<br>
How did the world change so drastically into a place of suffering and tragedy? The second and third chapters of Genesis tell the entire story of how sin entered our world. Read them at your leisure. Here is a brief summary of their contents.<br>
Some time after God established a perfect world, the Devil came to the Garden of Eden to tempt Adam and Eve into disobeying their Creator. God limited the Devil’s sphere of influence to one tree in the garden, the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” And He warned the first human couple to stay clear of this tree and never to eat its fruit, or they would die.<br>
But one day Eve wandered over by the forbidden tree. The Devil quickly launched into his sales pitch. He claimed God had lied to her and that if she ate the tree’s fruit she wouldn’t die, but would become wise like God Himself, knowing good and evil. Tragically Eve, and then Adam, who had only known good, allowed the Devil to con them, and they sampled the forbidden fruit-thus breaking their bond of trust and obedience with God.<br>
God planned for Adam and Eve to “rule” over our world as the stewards of God’s created works (Genesis 1:26). But because they broke faith with God and chose the Devil as their new leader, the couple lost their jurisdiction. Today the Devil claims the world as his and tries his best to enslave its people.<br>
There are many times when we find ourselves doing something selfish or even cruel when we really want to do the opposite. Why? Because the invisible enemy, the Devil, works to make people fail morally.<br>
As you read chapter 3 of Genesis, you will discover that sin caused Adam and Eve to hide from God in fear. Sin affected all of creation. Thorns appeared along with the flowers. The soil suffered from drought, and labor became a burden. Disease began to strike at random. Jealousy, animosity, and greed multiplied human miseries. Most terrible of all, with sin came death!<br>

“He was A MURDERER FROM THE BEGINNING,… there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is liar and THE FATHER OF LIES.”-John 8:44.<br>
According to Jesus, the Devil is the originator of sin in the universe, the “father” of sin and thus of murder and lying.<br>
Thomas Carlyle, the great English philosopher, once took Ralph Waldo Emerson through some of the worst streets of London’s East End. As they walked along, silently observing the wretchedness and evil around them, Carlyle finally asked, “Do you believe in the Devil now?”<br>

No! A good God would not create a devil. And yet the Bible states that the Devil, along with the angels he had deceived, lost their place in heaven and came to our world.<br>
“And there was WAR IN HEAVEN. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and THE DRAGON AND HIS ANGELS FOUGHT BACK. But he was not strong enough, and they LOST THEIR PLACE IN HEAVEN. The great dragon was hurled down-that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.”-Revelation 12:7-9.<br>
How did the Devil get into heaven in the first place?<br>
“You were anointed as a Guardian CHERUB, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God;…YOU WERE BLAMELESS IN YOUR WAYS from the day YOU WERE CREATED till WICKEDNESS WAS FOUND IN YOU.”- Ezekiel 28:14, 15.<br>
God did not create the Devil, He created Lucifer a perfect angel, one of heaven’s leading angels, standing next to God’s throne. But then he sinned-“wickedness was found in” him. Expelled from heaven, and posing as Adam and Eve’s friend, he became humanity’s deadliest enemy.<br>

“How YOU HAVE FALLEN FROM HEAVEN, O morning star, son of the dawn! YOU HAVE BEEN CAST DOWN TO THE EARTH…. YOU SAID IN YOUR HEART, ‘I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God;… I WILL MAKE MYSELF LIKE THE MOST HIGH.’ “-Isaiah 14:12-14.<br>
The being who became the Devil was originally called Lucifer, meaning “day star” or “shining one.” In this angel’s heart, vanity and ambition began to take the place of devotion. The seed of pride grew into an obsession to take God’s place.<br>
Lucifer must have worked hard to persuade other heavenly beings. It’s easy to imagine Satan arguing that God was holding something back from them, and that the divine law was too restrictive, and that God was an uncaring sovereign. He slandered the One whose character defines what love is.<br>
How was this conflict in heaven resolved?<br>
“Your heart became proud,… So I threw you to the earth.”-Ezekiel 28:17<br>
Pride changed the chief of angels into the Devil or Satan. And in order to preserve the peace and harmony of heaven, he and one third of heaven’s angels who joined him in rebellion, had to be expelled (Revelation 12:4, 7-9).<br>

Why didn’t God create beings incapable of sinning? If He had, there would be no problem of evil in our world. But God wanted people who could have meaningful relationships. So “God created man in His own image” (Genesis 1:27). This means we are free and responsible. We can decide to love God or turn our backs on Him.<br>
God gave the angels and human beings of every generation, a spiritual nature and a capacity to make real choices.<br>
“Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.”-Joshua 24:15.<br>
God challenges the beings He created in His image to choose to do right because their reasoning powers tell them “God’s way is best.” And to turn from wrong because their reasoning powers warn against the results of disobedience and sin.<br>
Only beings with the power to reason and choose can experience real love. God longed to create individuals who could comprehend and appreciate His character, freely respond to Him in love, and be filled with love for others. God wanted to share His love so much that He was willing to take the enormous risk of creating angels and people with the power of choice. He knew it was possible that someday one of His created beings might choose not to serve Him. The Devil was the first being in the universe to make that terrible choice. The tragedy of sin began with him (John 8:44, 1 John 3:8).<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Why didn’t God destroy Lucifer before his sin-disease could spread? Lucifer had challenged the fairness of God’s government. He had told lies about God. If God had destroyed Lucifer immediately, the angels would have begun to serve Him from fear rather than from love. This would have defeated the purpose God had in creating beings with the power of choice in the first place.<br>
How did anyone really know God’s way was best? God gave Satan a chance to demonstrate his alternative system. That’s why he was given an opportunity to tempt Adam and Eve. <br>
This planet has become a testing ground where the character of Satan and the nature of his kingdom are contrasted with the character of God and the nature of His kingdom. Who is right? Who can we ultimately trust? So deceptive was Lucifer, that it has taken time for the beings of the universe to be fully convinced of how disastrous Satan’s alternative actually is. But eventually everyone will see that “the wages of sin is death” and that “the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23)<br>
Every being in the universe will then agree that:<br>
“Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the ages… All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.”-Revelation 15:3, 4.<br>
After everyone understands the deadly nature of sin and the destructive nature of Satan’s philosophy, God can destroy Satan and sin. He will also have to destroy those who stubbornly resist His grace and cling to Satan’s alternative.<br>
God is just as anxious to resolve the problem of sin and suffering as we are to have Him do so. But He is waiting until He can do it on a permanent basis, and until He can both preserve our free will and prevent evil from ever appearing again.<br>
God has promised to destroy sin forever by purifying the heavens and this earth with fire. “In keeping with his promise” we can look “forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of the righteous” (2 Peter 3:10, 13). Sin will never again infect the universe. Sin’s tragic results will stand out so clearly that disobedience to God will seem repugnant for all eternity.<br>
Who makes possible the final destruction of the Devil and sin?<br>
“Since the children have flesh and blood, he [Christ] too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death-that is, the devil- and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.” Hebrews 2:14, 15.<br>
At the cross the angels and the unfallen worlds saw Satan for what he was-a deceiver, a liar, a murderer. There he revealed his true character by compelling men to murder the innocent Son of God. The inhabitants of the entire universe saw how senseless and cruel sin really is. The cross fully unmasked Satan’s motives, and when God destroys the Devil and those who persist in sin, all will acknowledge that God is just.<br>
Jesus’ death on the cross exposed Satan’s real intent before all created beings (John 12:31, 32). The cross also revealed Christ for what He is-the Savior of the world. At Golgotha the power of love stood out in stark contrast against the love of power. The cross established beyond any question that it is self-sacrificing love that motivates God in all His dealings with Satan, sin, and sinful men and women.<br>
At the cross Christ’s eloquent demonstration of God’s unconditional love decisively defeated the Devil. The battle had been over who should rule the world, Christ or Satan. And the cross settled it for all time. It must be Christ above all!<br>
Have you discovered a relationship with the Savior who died to reveal His matchless, unchanging love? How do you feel about the One who came to our world as a human being and died in your place to save you from the results of sin? Will you bow your head just now and thank Jesus, and then ask Him to come in and take possession of your life?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
After a minister had spoken on the subject, “Why I Believe in Jesus,” a well-dressed young man paid him a visit in his study and remarked, “Your talk tonight was interesting, but everything you said about Christ came out of your Bible. Tell me, if Jesus ever lived on this earth, why doesn’t history tell about Him?”<br>
“That’s a fair question,” the minister answered as he turned and took down several books. “But as a matter of fact, history does tell Jesus Christ.”<br>
“That I’d like to see for myself,” the young man responded.<br>
“Well here is Letter 97 of Book 10 of Letter of Pliny the Younger, Roman proconsul in Bithynia, a province of old Asia Minor. Pliny wrote to the Roman Emperor, Trajan, telling him about events in his province. See, here he is asking counsel on how he should handle a new sect, the Christians. He tells of their rapid growth and of how they sang hymns composed to their leader, Christ. Pliny sent his letter about A.D.110. The letter by Pliny offers historical evidence of the man, Christ, and of the spread of His faith in the days of His apostles.”<br>
Surprised, the young man said, “Tell me more!”<br>
As the minister thumbed through another book, he added, “Another historian, contemporary with Pliny, was Tacitus. In his Annals (Book 15, chapter 44) he tells of Nero’s hatred for, and persecution of, the Christians at the time of the burning of Rome. Tacitus explains that the term ‘Christian’ comes from the name ‘Christ’. He mentions that Jesus Christ, the founder of the Christian religion, had been put to death by Pontius Pilate, Procurator of Judea, during the reign of Emperor Tiberius. All these details that Tacitus gives us match exactly the events, names, and places given in the Bible.”<br>
“Pastor, I never knew things like that were in secular history!” the visitor exclaimed.<br>
The minister added, “I want you to notice that about A.D.180 Celsus wrote a book attacking Christian, indicating that Christianity by that time had become a force to reckon with. <br>
“If you are still in doubt, remember that the four Gospels are just as much history as these secular books.”<br>
When this young man realized that both sacred and secular history agree that Jesus did live as a man on earth, he went away convinced that Jesus Christ was a real, historical figure.<br>

Jesus was not merely a good man, He was also God. What claim did Jesus Himself make concerning His divinity?<br>
“If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him…. Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.”-John 14:7-9. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
If you wish to know the answer to the questions, “Who is God? What is He like?” just look at Jesus, who declared,<br>
“I and the Father are one.” –John 10:30.<br>
God the Father and Jesus the Son have existed together from eternity (Hebrew 1:8). There never was a time when Jesus was not one with the Father. The Father shares the same love and care for each person that Jesus demonstrated during His human life on earth. <br>

Since Christ’s life story is a fulfillment of prophecy, His life story was written before He was born. Old Testament prophecies present a clear outline of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection in advance. The New Testament is His life story told in fulfillment.<br>
Living from five hundred to fifteen hundred years before Christ’s birth, the Old Testament prophets made scores of very specific predictions about the life of the Messiah. And at the very beginning of Christ’s earthly ministry, as people compared His life with Old Testament prophecies, what did they conclude?<br>
“We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote-Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”-John 1:45.<br>
Our Savior appealed to fulfilled prophecies to establish His identity:<br>
“And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the [Old Testament] Scriptures concerning himself.”-Luke 24:25-27.<br>
Fulfilled prophecies give convincing evidence that Jesus is the promised Messiah.<br>

Let’s look at a few of these prophetic passages from the Old Testament- and their fulfillment in the New Testament record.<br>
HIS PLACE OF BIRTH<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“But you, BETHLEHEM Ephrathah,… out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.”-Micah 5:2, NKJV.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“Jesus was born in BETHLEHEM in Judea.”-Matthew 2:1.<br>
HIS VIRGIN BIRTH<br>
The Old Testament prophecy:<br>
“The VIRGIN will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel [God with us].”-Isaiah 7:14.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because WHAT IS CONCEIVED IN HER IS FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus [the LORD saves].”-Matthew 1:20-23.<br>
HIS LINEAGE FROM THE TRIBE OF JUDAH<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“THE SCEPTER WILL NOT DEPART FROM JUDAH,… until he comes to whom it belongs.” Genesis 49:10.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“For it is clear that OUR LORD DESCENDED FROM JUDAH.”-Hebrews 7:14.<br>
HIS REJECTION<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
He was despised and REJECTED by men.”-Isaiah 53:3<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“He came to that which was his own, but HIS OWN DID NOT RECEIVE HIM.” <br>
-John 1:11.<br>
HIS BETRAYAL AND THE FEE PAID HIS TRAITOR<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“Even MY CLOSE FRIEND, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.”-Psalm 41:9.<br>
“I told them, ‘If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, kept it.’ So they paid me THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER.”-Zechariah 11:12.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“Then one of the Twelve-the one called Judas Iscariot-went to the chief priests and asked, ‘What are you willing to give me if I handed him over to you? ‘So they counted out for him THIRTY PIEECES OF SILVER COINS.”-Matthew 26:14, 15.<br>
HIS DEATH ON A CROSS<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“They have PIERCED MY HANDS and my feet.”-Psalm 22:16.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“When they came to the place called the Skull, there THEY CRUCIFIED him.”-Luke 23:33. (See also John 20:25.)<br>
HIS ESCAPE FROM THE TOMB<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“Because YOU WILL NOT ABANDON ME TO THE GRAVE, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.”-Psalm 16:10.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that HE WAS NOT ABANDONED TO THE GRAVE, nor did his body see decay. God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact.”-Act 2:31, 32. <br>
The evidence is strong that Jesus didn’t just happen to fit a few predictions. His biography was indeed written beforehand by supernatural means. Truly, Jesus is the Son of God.<br>
After looking at the evidence, we need to make a prayerful decision about who is going to be Lord in our lives. If you have not already done so, will you place your life in Jesus’ hands?<br>

It’s possible, of course, to assume you are living a God-directed life when you are merely following your own inclinations and impulses (Proverbs 16:25). Our feelings must harmonize with Bible teaching. It’s not safe to conclude that God is leading us unless all three of the guides harmonize.<br>
Take Jake, for example. He has a lovely wife and two children, but had an affair with another woman. He told his friends: “I’ve prayed about it and I feel it’s God’s will.”<br>
Sources for the above historical material and a more detailed history appear in the following books: Documents of the Christian Church, selected and edited by Henry Bettenson (London, Oxford University Press); Joseph Cullen Ayer, A Source Book for Ancient Church History (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1931, 1941); Origen: Contra Celsum, translated by Henry Chadwick (Cambridge: University Press, 1996); F. F. Bruce, The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? 5th edition, revised (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1960; and R. T. France, The Evidence for Jesus (Downers Groove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1986). The last two books come in inexpensive paperback editions and should be available through most religious bookstores. If the first three books are not available in your local library, those in the United States can ask the librarian to order them through inter-library loan.<br>
Jake’s emotions and “inner impressions” clearly sent him down the wrong path. He imagined that it was “providential” that he’d met this other woman and didn’t step back to look at the Bible commands against adultery. And the Bible, “the law and the testimony,” is the authoritative guidebook, the final judge for determining a right course of action (Isaiah 8:20). We must never allow any impression or apparently providential circumstance lead us away from biblical principle.<br>

When the Devil came to tempt Jesus in the wilderness, he suggested, “If you will only forego the painful sacrifices your Father has planned for you, I’ll give you the world in the palm of your hand-with fame, fortune, and a comfortable lifestyle.” Satan even quoted Scripture in an attempt to lead Jesus astray. But each time Jesus fought him off with the words, “It is written” (Matthew 4:1-11). <br>
One powerful lesson we can learn from the life of Jesus is submission to the Father’s will. Even amid the terrible agony of Gethsemane, He cried out, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will” (Matthew 26:39). After three years of His ministry, living day by day in harmony with the Father’s plan, Christ’s dying words were: “It is finished” (John 19:30). Jesus was really saying, “My God-planned life is now complete and fulfilled.”<br>
As you begin to hear God’s voice speaking <br>
coherently through His <br>
Word, providential <br>
circumstances, and direct <br>
impressions, you can learn <br>
to accept His guidance <br>
wholeheartedly. You too <br>
can discover the joy of a <br>
God-planned and a God-<br>
guided life.<br>

They found his skeleton beside a makeshift shelter on a desolate island in the mid-Atlantic. The anonymous seaman kept a journal which detailed his four-month ordeal. He’d been set ashore on Ascension Island by the Dutch fleet in 1725 for some unmentioned crime. Soon he was reduced to drinking the blood of turtles just to quench his raging thirst. The man’s physical suffering was intense, but an even greater pain stands out in his journal: his overwhelming guilt.<br>
He penned tormented words such as: “What pangs do wretched mortals feel who leave the paths of righteousness, pleased to increase the numbers of the damned.” This seaman’s greatest isolation on that lonely island came from his sense of separation from God. That is what proved unbearable in the end.<br>
Human beings have been struggling with that isolation of the heart ever since Adam and Eve “hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden” after eating the forbidden fruit (Genesis 3:8). The strange new emotions of shame, guilt, and fear compelled that first couple to run away when God came calling. Those feelings are unfortunately quite familiar to us now.<br>
What is it that causes a separation between us and God?<br>
“Your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you.”-Isaiah 59:2. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
This great gulf that isolates sinful beings from God is not His doing. God didn’t run from Adam and Eve-they ran from Him.<br>

Before sin spoiled the picture, Adam and Eve enjoyed intimacy with their Creator in a beautiful Garden home in Eden. Tragically, they bought Satan’s lie about becoming as wise as God and broke the bond of trust with their Maker (Genesis 3).<br>
                                                      <br>
After being expelled from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve found life a lot tougher on the outside. Childbearing and tilling the soil now came with blood, sweat, and tears. Their close bond with God broken, they found themselves vulnerable to unsatisfied desires and painful yearnings-the loneliness of sin.<br>
Since Adam and Eve’s first act of rebellion, “all” (the entire human race) have fallen into the same sin pattern and are subject to death, sin’s ultimate penalty.<br>
“Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way DEATH CAME TO ALL MEN, because ALL SINNED.”-Romans 5:12.<br>
                                                      <br>
We all experience a great hunger of the heart for that which we’ve lost, a longing for a kind of security which only God can give. We often try to satisfy that hunger by a shopping binge, or a mad race for promotion at work, or by simply drowning out the hunger with alcohol, drugs, or promiscuity.<br>
But all our yearnings are symptoms of a loneliness for God. And there is no cure except experiencing His love in our life.<br>
                                                      <br>
“You…will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.”-Psalm 16:11.<br>
                                                      <br>
Real satisfaction will only come when that gap between us and God is bridged and we’re able to walk over into His presence.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
People are not the only ones made lonely by sin. God’s heart ached too on the day Adam and Eve turned their backs on Him. And He still grieves over human sorrows and tragedies. God is eager to satisfy our hidden longings and to heal our emotional wounds. He wasn’t content just to look sympathetically across the chasm that separates us from Him. God decided to become a bridge across the chasm of sin and death.<br>
                                                      <br>
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”-John 3:16, 17.<br>
God gave His Son, and Jesus gave His life as sacrifice for sin, paying the death penalty Himself. His life, death, and resurrection made it possible to forgive and save sinners without trivializing sin, and gave the universe a demonstration of the true character of Christ and Satan. The bridge of Christ’s broken, bleeding body draws people back from the trap of sin. Love spans the chasm, enabling all who place their faith in Christ as Lord and Savior to walk over into eternal life.<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
These seven facts about Jesus are not true of any other man who has ever lived:<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>1. Jesus Came From Heaven to Earth</strong><br>
How long did Jesus claim to have existed?<br>
“Before Abraham was born, I am!”-John 8:58.<br>
Jesus notified the world: “I am!” I have always existed and always will. Though Jesus was born of a human mother (Matthew 1:22, 23), He is God-God in human flesh.<br>
                                                      <br>
Dwight L. Moody, the Billy Graham of the 19th century, once said of the incarnation of Jesus, “It would have been a great sacrifice for Jesus to come and be rocked in a silver cradle, be nursed by an angel, and be fed with a golden spoon. But the Creator of heaven and earth came and took man’s flesh, and was born in a stable of poor parents in the worst possible environment.”<br>
                                                      <br>
An angel told Joseph at the time of Jesus’ birth:<br>
“She [Mary] will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because HE WILL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS.”-Matthew 1:21.<br>
Jesus, the Creator of the universe (John 1:1-3, 14), was willing to come to our world to rescue us from sin and death.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>2. Jesus Lived a Sinless Life</strong><br>
“Jesus the Son of God,… has been tempted in every way, just as we are-yet was without sin.”-Hebrews 4:14, 15.<br>
                                                      <br>
God did more than try to talk us out of a life of sin and into a more satisfying one. By living here as a Man, Jesus made a life free from sin far more attractive than any sermon ever could.<br>
                                                      <br>
Satan, Christ’s adversary, plotted throughout Jesus’ earthly life to seduce Him into sin. In the wilderness the Devil unleashed his fiercest assault against His integrity (Matthew 4:1-11). In Gethsemane before His crucifixion, the pressure of temptation reached such intensity, Jesus sweat drops of blood (Luke 22:44).<br>
But Christ stood firm against everything the Devil threw at Him-“yet without sin.” Because Jesus experienced the full range of human problems and temptations, He understands our struggles. He is able “to sympathize with our weaknesses” (Hebrews 4:15).<br>
                                                      <br>
Why was it necessary for Jesus to live a sinless life?<br>
“God made Jesus who was sinless, to be sin for us; and in place of our sinful life Jesus gives us His sinless life, that we might be made sinless in Him.”-2 Corinthians 5:21, paraphrased.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus overcame temptation and lived a sinless life so He could pass it on to us in exchange for our old life of sin.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>3. Jesus Died to Take Away Sin</strong><br>
How many people have sinned?<br>
“For ALL have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”-Romans 3:23.<br>
                                                      <br>
What is the penalty for sin?<br>
“The wages of sin is DEATH; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”-Romans 6:23.<br>
                                                      <br>
Why did Jesus die?<br>
“Look, the Lamb of God, who TAKES AWAY THE SIN of the world!” (John 1:29).<br>
All of us have sinned and are subject to eternal death, but Jesus died in our place. He became “sin for us.” He paid the death penalty for us. His dying is a gift, and “the GIFT of God is ETERNAL LIFE in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus laid down His perfect, righteous life as a gift of love to us. Love like that is almost beyond human comprehension. And because of His death “we have PEACE with God” (Romans 5:1).<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>4. Jesus Arose From the Dead<br>
                                                      </strong>Jesus’ death on the cross wasn’t the end of His remarkable story. He couldn’t very well remain dead and be our Savior.<br>
                                                      <br>
“And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.”-1 Corinthians 15:17, 18.<br>
Mohammed and Buddha have presented to the world some great philosophical truths. They have inspired the lives of millions of people, but they have no supernatural power to give life since they still remain their graves. <br>
                                                      <br>
Because Jesus rose from the tomb the third day after His death, what promise is He able to make to us?<br>
“Because I live, you also will live.”-John 14:19.<br>
Jesus is alive! Because He has a power over death, He can deliver us from death and offer us life that is both abundant and eternal. He will live in our hearts if we invite Him in. The risen Christ is present to meet our needs today.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”-Matthew 28:20.<br>
Men and women all over the world are sharing stories of how Christ has delivered them from the worst addictions and the deepest emotional traumas. <br>
One of our former students wrote these words of gratitude on one of his answer sheets: “I was an alcoholic. One day while drunk, I saw a card in the gutter advertising your Bible course. I picked it up, filled it out, and received my first true knowledge of Christ. Shortly after taking the Bible course, I offered my heart to God and lost the taste for whiskey.”<br>
                                                      <br>
When Jesus took possession of this man’s life, a new power gave him the ability to overcome his addiction. Because Christ is the risen Savior, He can save all who will come to Him for help.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>5. Jesus Ascended to Heaven</strong><br>
Before Jesus returned to the Father after His resurrection (Acts 1:9), He made this promise to His followers:<br>
“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms … I am going there TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU. And … I will come back and take you to be with me… where I am.”-John 14:1-3.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>6. Jesus Ministers as Heavenly Priest</strong><br>
Jesus constantly seeks to prepare us for a place in heaven.<br>
“He had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful HIGH PRIEST in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.”-Hebrews 2:17-18.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus came into our world to “make atonement for the sins of the people,” and rescue us from the misery of enslavement to sin. He died to save us so He can ultimately eradicate the cause of sin, suffering, and death by destroying the Devil.<br>
Jesus as our High Priest was “made like his brothers in every way.” And He now appears continually in the Father’s presence on our behalf as our Mediator. The same Jesus who blessed the children, rehabilitated the woman caught in adultery, and forgave the dying thief on the cross, is working in heaven right now to minister to our needs, “to help those who are being tempted.”<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>7. Jesus Will Return</strong><br>
Before returning to heaven, what promise did Jesus make?<br>
“If I go and prepare a place for you, I WILL COME BACK and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.”-John 14:3.<br>
                                                      <br>
When Jesus returns, He will deliver us from the sin, sickness, tragedy, and death that plague this planet. And He will welcome us into a new world of eternal happiness and immortal life.<br>
                                                      <br>

The story is told of an arranged marriage in Taiwan between U Long and a young woman named “Golden Flower.” When U Long lifted the veil from his bride after the ceremony, he was shocked and disgusted. Her face had been scarred by smallpox.<br>
                                                      <br>
After that, U Long had as little to do with his wife as possible. She tried her best to make him happy; she worked hard at home, hoping her husband would eventually accept her. But he remained coldly different to all her expressions of affection.<br>

After twelve years of this sham marriage, U Long began to lose vision in both eyes. A doctor told him would go completely blind if he didn’t have a cornea transplant. But the operation was expensive and there was a long waiting list.<br>
Golden Flower began to work long hours in the evening making straw hats for extra money. One day, U Long was informed that someone’s cornea had been made available after an accident. He rushed to the hospital to have the operation.<br>
After he had recovered, he grudgingly decided to see his wife so he could thank her for raising the money. When he turned her bowed head so she could look at him, U Long gasped. She stared at him with sightless, blank eyes, the cornea gone. Overcome with emotion, he sank at her feet and sobbed. And then for the first time he whispered her name: Golden Flower.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus longs for a relationship with those who’ve been indifferent to Him for so long. He longs for us to finally whisper His name as our Savior. He was willing to sacrifice not only His eyes but His whole body in order to demonstrate His unfailing love. His love is so powerful that Christ “came into the world to save sinners” (Timothy 1:15).<br>
                                                      <br>
JESUS CAME as God in human flesh.<br>
LIVED a sinless life in our place.<br>
DIED for our sins.<br>
AROSE to deliver us from death.<br>
ASCENDED to prepare a home for us in heaven.<br>
MINISTERS each day as our high priest.<br>
IS COMING SOON to take us to be with Him forever.<br>
                                                      <br>
Christ’s great sacrifice has created a bridge that spans our indifference, that covers our alienation. Have you personally discovered that He wants to draw you<br>
over the chasm and into His arms? Will you respond and pray, “Jesus, I love You.<br>
Thank You for Your incredible sacrifice. Come into my heart and save me now-save me wholly, save me completely, save me eternally”?<br>

After living most of his life as a Buddhist, an elderly man in Singapore who had become a Christian was asked, “Mr. Lim, what difference do you find between being a Buddhist and being a Christian?<br>
“That’s easy,” he answered. “Since I’ve found Jesus as my Savior, I have such a peace in my heart.”<br>
That’s what happens when we center our lives on Christ.<br>
“You [God] will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You.”-Isaiah 26:3 NKJV. (Unless otherwise noted all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER Guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Living the Christian life results in perfect peace-a perfect sense of security and well-being.<br>
Those who have made this discovery have found the only way to a second chance at life-Jesus!<br>

It’s possible for a physically alive person to be having what some call a good time, and still be dead-that is, spiritually dead.<br>
“YOU WERE DEAD IN YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS AND SINS, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, THE [EVIL] SPIRIT WHO IS NOW AT WORK in those who are dishonest.”-Ephesians 2:1, 2.<br>
                                                      <br>
Satan leads a spiritually dead person down a descending spiral of sin and disobedience. But the wonderful truth of the gospel is that God loves such doomed people. He loves them while they are dead in their sins, and offers them a full and free deliverance from their predicament.<br>
                                                      <br>
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, MADE US ALIVE WITH CHRIST EVEN WHEN WE WERE DEAD IN TRANSGRESSIONS…[to] show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.”-Ephesians 2:4-7.<br>
                                                      <br>
God loved us when we had nothing lovable about us. His grace created in us a new life in Christ. We can't change ourselves, but God can. When we come to Him in faith and submission, He gives us a second chance at life as a free gift.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <strong>1. We need to be saved from sin.</strong><br>
“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”-Romans 3:23.<br>
To put it bluntly: we don’t live up to what we know is right. A parent under stress may blow up and wound a child emotionally. A person may become incensed at another driver and almost cause an accident. A student may grow resentful and whisper unkind things about another student. A businessman may plan to “forget” about a certain source of income at tax time. “All have sinned”; that’s the human condition.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <em>How does the Bible define sin?</em><br>
“All wrongdoing is sin.”-1 John 5:17.<br>
We need to be rescued from all kinds of unhealthy habits and compulsions: lying, abusive anger, lust, bitterness, to name a few.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.”-1John 3:4.<br>
So we need to be saved from sin-breaking God’s commandments.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>2. We need to be saved from a broken relationship with God.</strong><br>
“Your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you.”-Isaiah 59:2.<br>
                                                      <br>
Unforgiven sin cuts off our relationship with God. Christ came to restore trust in God, which Satan had undermined.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>3. We need to be saved from eternal death-sin’s penalty.</strong><br>
“Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned.”-Romans5:12.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>4. We need to be saved from a sinful, unhappy, empty life.</strong><br>
For the sinner, life is a dead-end street.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>5. We need to be saved from a sinful world.</strong><br>
We must be rescued from a world full of sin and its results-misery, heartache, loneliness, war, sickness, and death!<br>

Only Jesus can save us.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>1. Jesus can deliver us from sin.</strong><br>
“You are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”-Matthew 1:21.<br>
A Hindu told a Christian friend, “I find many things in Hinduism not found in Christianity, but there is one thing Christianity has that Hinduism does not have-a Savior.” Christianity is the only world religion offering people a Savior.<br>
(2)Jesus can save us from our broken relationship with God.<br>
“You were separate from Christ… without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.”-Ephesians 2:12, 13.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus is the perfect Friend to enjoy a relationship with. He loves to bring out the best in us. “Through the blood of Christ” our past life of sin is forgiven, and day-by-day He gives us His acceptance, power over sin, and His perfect life. We know He’ll be there to pick us up every time we fall. Our love for Him in turn produces a desire to live in a way that pleases Him. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>3. Jesus can save us from eternal death, sin’s penalty.</strong><br>
“For the wages of sin is [eternal] death; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”-Romans 6:23.<br>
We are lawbreakers sentenced to die. The penalty for sin is death. Jesus saves us from eternal death and gives us eternal life.<br>
                                                      <br>
“God demonstrates his own love for us, in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”-Romans 5:8.<br>
Because of his unfailing love, Jesus “died for us.” And because He died for us and suffered the full results of sin, God can now forgive and accept sinners without trivializing sin.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>4. Jesus can save us from a sinful, unhappy life.</strong><br>
“For if a man is in Christ he becomes a new person altogether-the past is finished and gone, everything has become fresh and new.”-2 Corinthians 5:17, Phillips. <br>
We can’t save ourselves from sin or change our nature on our own any more than a lion can decide to become a lamb (Romans 7:18). Sin is simply stronger than our willpower. But Christ is able to “strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being” (Ephesians 3:16). He works to replace our destructive habits with His healthy qualities: love, peace, joy, kindness, self-control (Galatians 5:22, 23). Christ lives His life through us, and we receive spiritual healing, restoration, and a new life.<br>
                                                      <br>
Harold Hughes had given up hope of ever changing. He’d tried desperately to stop drinking many times. He knew only too well that his battle with the bottle had put his wife and two daughters through ten years of hell. And so he stepped into his bathtub one cold morning and pointed a shotgun muzzle into his mouth. Before pulling the trigger, he decided he’d better explain things to God. That prayer turned into a long, sobbing appeal for help.<br>
                                                      <br>
And God came through. Harold Hughes made a commitment to Christ and found the spiritual strength to persevere. He quit drinking for good, became a loving, dependable husband and father, and went on to earn a seat in the U.S. Senate. Harold Hughes discovered the greatest transforming power in our world-Jesus!<br>

                                                      <strong>5. Jesus can save us from sinful world.</strong><br>

“GOD’S KINDNESS LEADS YOU TOWARD REPENTANCE.”-Romans 2:4.<br>
“YOUR SORROW LED YOU TO REPENTANCE.”-2 Corinthians 7:9.<br>
Repentance is simply being sorry for our past life of sin, and then turning away from our sins, making a break with the old habits, practices, and attitudes. It’s not sorrow just because we fear punishment, but a response to “God’s kindness” that led Jesus to die in our place for our sinfulness. We reject sin because it hurts God.<br>
When we experience a new life in Christ, we should so far as possible make past wrongs right (Ezekiel 33:14-16).<br>
                                                      <br>
HOW WE RECEIVE A NEW LIFE FROM CHRIST<br>
1.We believe in Him and receive Him as Savior and Lord.<br>
2.We establish a relationship with Him. (A regular time of prayer and Bible reading is vital.)<br>
3.Christ works through His Spirit to replace our bad habits with His good qualities.<br>
                                                      <br>
What is God’s part in getting rid of our old life of sin?<br>
Both repentance and being forgiven are a gift to us from God.<br>
“God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and SAVIOR that he might GIVE REPENTANCE and FORGIVENESS OF SINS.”-Acts 5:31.<br>
And when we repent, a loving Savior forgives our sins, cleanses us from sin, and throws them into the depths of the sea.<br>
                                                      <br>
“IF WE CONFESS our sins, HE IS FAITHFUL and just AND WILL FORGIVE US our sins and PURIFY US FROM all unrighteousness.”-1 John 1:9. (See also Micah 7:18, 19.)<br>
There is no sin so terrible that the Savior who died for our sins on Calvary’s cross can’t forgive. A person who trusts in Jesus need only ask Him for His pardon. Christ’s dying for us can’t pardon us unless we ask to be forgiven. It’s a sobering fact that our sins helped drive those nails through Christ’s hands and feet. And yet Jesus is more eager than we can imagine for us to accept His gift of pardon and reconciliation.<br>
                                                      <br>
Word reached a young man who’d run away from home that his mother was dying. The news filled him with remorse over their broken relationship. Hurrying home, he rushed into the room and threw himself oh his mother’s bed. In a flood of tears he begged her to forgive him.<br>
She drew him close and whispered, “Son, I would have forgiven you long ago if you’d only asked.”<br>
                                                      <br>
If you have drifted away from God-or have not yet come to know Him-please think about how eager your loving heavenly Father is to welcome you home. He wants more than anything else for you to accept His offer of pardon. Jesus loves you. He died for you. He is always willing to forgive you. So respond to His gracious invitation to repent. Confess your sins. Simply believe that God forgives you and he does. Trust him! Trust His promises.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Step 2. Receive a new life from Jesus.</strong><br>
Your part in receiving a new life from Jesus is to believe that Jesus has really saved you. Accept without question the fact that He has forgiven and cleansed you, taken away your old life of sin, and given you an entirely new and changed life.<br>
                                                      <br>
“All… who believed in his name, he gave the right [power, authority, privilege] to become children of God.”-John 1:12.<br>
As a child of God, you have “the right” to receive a new life from Jesus. As we have said, you can’t achieve it on your own-it’s a gift from your heavenly Father! Jesus gives such an absolute promise in order to remove our insecurities and doubts.<br>
                                                      <br>
What is God’s part in giving us a new life?<br>
“Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’”-John 3:3.<br>
                                                      <br>
According to Jesus, a believing, repentant sinner is actually born into a new life. It is a miracle that only God can perform. He promises:<br>
“I will give you a NEW HEART and put a NEW SPIRIT in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.”-Ezekiel 36:26. <br>
Jesus transforms our heart-our feelings and behavior-and dwells “in us” (Colossians 1:27). This new life is not just a nice, spiritual idea; it’s a hard, solid fact, a resurrection from spiritual death to an entirely new life and existence.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Step 3. Live for Jesus every day.</strong><br>
The Christian life involves a daily turning away from selfishness, and bonding with Jesus as our loving Friend. We grow in this new life by strengthening our relationship with Jesus. This means spending quality time with Him, building honest and open communication. God has given us five divine aids for spiritual growth: Bible study, prayer, meditation, fellowship with other Christians, and sharing our experience with others.<br>
                                                      <br>
Living in Christ doesn’t mean we never make mistakes. But when we stumble and sin, we claim Christ’s forgiveness, and keep going. We’re headed in a certain direction, and we know Christ remains a living presence in our hearts.<br>
                                                      <br>

Harold Hughes received many honors during his distinguished career as a U.S. Senator, but the one that meant the most to him came shortly after his commitment to Christ.<br>
                                                      <br>
Harold was studying the Bible alone in his living room one evening when he felt a nudge at his elbow. He looked up. It was his two small daughters standing quietly in their nightgowns. He stared at them for a moment; they had changed so much, and he had missed so much during his devastating battle with the bottle.<br>
Then Carol, the younger said, “Daddy, we’ve come to kiss you good-night.”<br>
The father’s eyes blurred. It had been so long since the children had come for his embrace. Now their beautiful clear eyes held no fear. Daddy had come home at last.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus does truly give people a second chance. He takes the most hopeless cases and creates new beginnings.<br>
                                                      <br>
The Savior longs for each one of us to come home at last. Have you accepted Christ’s loving invitation? Receiving God’s forgiveness and cleansing is as simple and profound as opening your arms for a child’s embrace.<br>
                                                      <br>
If you have not yet trusted in Christ as your personal Savior, you can do so right now by praying something like this:<br>
“Father, I am sorry for my old life of sin. Thank you for sending your Son to this world to die in my place. Jesus, please forgive my sins and come into my life and save me. I want a second chance at life- I want to be born again. Even more, I want to establish a day-by-day relationship with You. Thank you for performing this miracle in me. In Jesus name, Amen”<br>
Make this wonderful discovery: When we do the coming, Jesus does the saving.<br>

Doctors Patricia and David Mrazek saw a great deal of heartbreak in their work. As pediatric specialists they dealt with many suffering children. But they were struck by the fact that some kids bounced back from disaster while others were crushed by it. Why? Why, for example, does one child go to drugs, while another goes to college? Why do some abused children grow up become abusers themselves, while others become good parents?<br>
The Mrazeks conducted an extensive survey to find answers to these questions. In their study, one overriding trait kept popping up among those kids who survived trauma and went on to build healthy lives. The secret? “A basic life view of optimism and hope.”<br>
Hope made the difference. Hope, more than anything else, helps us beat the odds when they’re stacked against us.<br>
Human beings desperately need hope. But how do we get it? Hope is hard to find in our world-UNTIL we look at it from the perspective of Bible prophecy. This DISCOVER guide examines a remarkable prophecy that has inspired countless individuals with a vibrant hope.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
About five hundred years before the birth of Christ, God gave the world a startling glimpse into the future through the prophet Daniel. God presented an outline of world history in advance for 2,500 years, from Daniel’s time to our own day.<br>
This prophecy originated in a dream God gave Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, some 2,500 years ago. The dream deeply troubled this monarch-but he couldn’t remember the dream when he woke up! After all of Babylonian’s wise men failed to help the king recall his dream or interpret it, a young Hebrew exile named Daniel arrived on the scene, claiming that the God of Heaven could reveal all mysteries.<br>
Standing before the king, Daniel boldly declared:<br>
“You looked, O king, and there before you stood A LARGE STATUE-an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.”<br>
The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.<br>
“While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.”<br>
“Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But THE ROCK THAT STRUCK THE STATUE became a huge mountain and FILLED THE WHOLE EARTH.”-Daniel 2:31-35. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
This statue, at first glance, may seem to have little to do with finding hope in contemporary times, but hold on.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
After telling a very impressed Nebuchadnezzar exactly what he’d seen in his vision, the prophet Daniel explained:<br>
“This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.”-Daniel 2:36.<br>
THE HEAD OF GOLD: What world power did Daniel tell the king the head of gold symbolized?<br>
“You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory…. YOU ARE THAT HEAD OF GOLD.”-Verses 37, 38.<br>
Daniel was saying to the ruler of the world’s greatest empire: “Nebuchadnezzar, God is telling you that your empire, Babylon, is represented by the statues’ golden head.”<br>
THE CHEST AND ARMS OF SILVER: From a human perspective Babylon looked like an empire that would last forever. But what does the prophecy say would happen next?<br>
“After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours.”-Verse 39.<br>
In fulfillment of God’s prediction, Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom crumbled into ruins when Cyrus, the Persian general, overthrew the Babylonians empire in 539 B.C. So the chest and arms of silver represent Medo-Persia, another mighty empire.<br>
THE BELLY AND THIGHS OF BRONZE: What does this part of the great metal image represent?<br>
“Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.”-Verse 39.<br>
The belly and thighs of bronze of the image symbolize the kingdom of Greece. Alexander the Great conquered the Medes and the Persians, turning Greece into the world’s third great empire. He ruled from 331 to 168 B.C.<br>
THE LEGS OF IRON:<br>
“Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom [said the prophet], strong as iron-for iron breaks and smashes everything-and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others.”-Verse 40.<br>
After the death of Alexander, his empire weakened and split into rival factions until finally in 168 B.C., at the battle of Pydna, the “Iron Empire” of Rome crushed Greece.<br>
Caesar Augustus ruled the Roman Empire when Jesus was born about two thousand years ago (Luke 2:1). Christ and His apostles lived during the period represented by the legs of iron. Gibbon, the eighteenth-century historian, no doubt had Daniel’s prophecy in mind when he wrote: “The images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome.”-Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (John D. Morris and Company), vol. 4, p.89.<br>
Think for a moment about this prediction from a human point of view. How could Daniel, living in the time of Babylon, have any idea of how many empires would succeed each other hundreds of years in the future? We have a hard time figuring out what the stock market is going to do next week! And yet Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome followed each other exactly as predicted-like obedient schoolboys in a line.<br>
Is God in control of the future? Can we have hope on the basis of His grand plan?<br>
The answer is a resounding, Yes!<br>
THE FEET AND TOES OF IRON MIXED WITH CLAY: Would a fifth world power follow Rome?<br>
“Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so THIS WILL BE A DIVIDED KINGDOM; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.”-Daniel 2:41, 42.<br>
The prophet predicted, not a fifth world empire, but a division of the iron monarchy of Rome. Rome would fracture into ten kingdoms, as symbolized by the feet and toes of the image.<br>
Did this actually happen? It certainly did. During the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian Era Barbaric invaders from the north poured down on the decaying Roman Empire, delivering blow after blow. Finally ten of the tribes gained most of the territory of Western Rome, and ten distinct, independent nations established themselves within the boundaries of Europe. Thus the toes symbolize the modern nations of Europe today.<br>

Does Daniel’s prophecy predict that efforts would be made to unite these nations of Europe under one ruler?<br>
“And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so THE PEOPLE will be a mixture and WILL NOT REMAIN UNITED, anymore than iron mixes with clay.”-Daniel 2:43.<br>
Over and over powerful men have tried to unite Europe, but they fall short of the goal every time. Napoleon came nearer than any other man to uniting a divided Europe, but probably thinking of this prophecy, as he fled defeated from the Battlefield of Waterloo, he cried, “God Almighty is too much for me!”<br>
TEN TOES – TEN MAJOR TRIBES IN THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE<br>
Anglo-Saxons&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (England)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (France)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alamanni&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Germany)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lombards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italy)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostrogoths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Later destroyed)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visigoths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Spain)<br>
Burgundians&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Switzerland)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vandals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (North Africa, later destroyed)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Suevi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Portugal)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Heruli&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Disappeared after a few centuries)<br>
                                                      <br>
Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler created the most powerful armed forces of their day. But each failed to unite Europe under their rule. Why? Because God’s Word was at stake: “The people will be a mixture and will not remain united.” The outcome of two world wars confirm that God holds the future in His hands; He is ultimately in control. That’s certainly enough to give us hope, peace, of mind, and confidence in His plan for our lives.<br>

Only one part of Daniel’s prophecy remains unfulfilled. What is the meaning of the stone that strikes the statue on the feet, grinds it to powder, and becomes a great mountain which fills the whole earth?<br>
“IN THE TIME OF THOSE KINGS [the modern nations of Europe], THE GOD OF HEAVEN WILL SET UP A KINGDOM that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but IT WILL ITSELF ENDURE FOREVER.”-Daniel 2:44.<br>
“Those kings” could refer only to the kings symbolized by the feet and toes of the statue-the rulers of modern Europe, pointing to our day. The stone that is cut out without human hands is to strike the statue and break it into pieces, and will then fill the whole earth (verses 34, 35, 45). Soon Jesus will descend from heaven to “set up a kingdom” His kingdom of happiness and peace. Then Christ, the Rock of Ages and the King of Kings, will rule the world forever!<br>
Everything in the prediction of Daniel 2 has come to pass except the final act-the striking of the statue by the stone. According to God’s timetable, we are now approaching the grand climax, Christ’s return to our world. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is about to end the long, bloody struggle of human history and establish His eternal kingdom of love and grace.<br>

This prophecy reveals the guiding hand of God in the rise and fall of nations. God knows the past, and this Bible prophecy clearly shows that He knows the future as well. If God directs the movements of nations with such precision, surely He can guide each individual’s life. Jesus assured us: “Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid” (Matthew 10:30-31). God’s gift of faith can become the antidote to all our worries and fears. The hope He inspires can serve as an anchor for our souls (Hebrews 6:19).<br>
The sixteenth-century scholar Erasmus related an incident during a sea voyage that stayed with him the rest of his life. His sailing vessel ran aground in a storm. As violent waves smashed against the ship and it began to break up, even the sailors panicked. The passengers were near hysteria. Most shouted for help to their patron saint, sang hymns, or pleaded loudly in prayer.<br>
Erasmus noted one passenger, however, who acted very differently. “Of all of us,” Erasmus wrote, “the one who remained most composed was a young woman who was holding a baby whom she was nursing. She was the only one who did not shout, weep or bargain with Heaven. She did nothing but pray quietly to herself while clasping the baby tightly on her lap.”<br>
This prayer, Erasmus realized, was just continuation of her regular prayer life. She seemed to entrust herself to God.<br>
As the ship began to sink, this young mother was placed on a plank, given a spar to use as an oar, and sent out into the waves. She had to hold her baby with one hand and attempt to row with the other. Few thought she would survive the pounding surf.<br>
But her faith and composure stood her in good stead. The woman and her child were the first to reach shore.<br>
Hope in a trustworthy God can make all the difference-even when our world seems to be breaking up around us. We’re not out there paddling on our own. A greater hand is guiding us and holding us up.<br>
If you will come to Christ in full surrender, He will give you a faith that will see you through every storm. Discover the supernatural peace that Jesus promises:<br>
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you…. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”-John 14:27.<br>
Do you have that peace? If you do, thank Jesus, your Savior. If you don’t, why not invite Him into your life today?<br>

After years of mistreatment, Armando Valladares was an emaciated, crippled shadow of his former self. He was serving a 30-year sentence in one of Castro’s prisons for praying in a church on Christmas Day. Prison officials starved, tortured, and humiliated the man, but he refused to give up his faith.<br>
Something kept him going: a promise he’d made to a young woman named Martha. They had met and fallen in love while he was in prison. She was deeply attracted to his passionate faith. Shortly after the couple married in a civil ceremony in the prison courtyard, Martha was forced to emigrate to Miami.<br>
Their separation was very painful. But Armando managed to smuggle out a promise to his beloved. On a tiny piece of discarded paper he scribbled his pledge: “I will come to you. The bayonets in the horizon beyond my back will no longer matter.”<br>
This prisoner determined that somehow he and Martha would make their vows in a church before God. Someday their union would be complete. “You are always with me,” he told her.<br>
Armando’s promise kept him going through years of mistreatment that would have destroyed the spirit of most men. And it kept Martha going. She worked tirelessly to bring public attention to her husband’s plight. She never gave up hope.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
At times we may be tempted to wonder, will Christ really descend someday from this blue sky above us for a wonderful reunion? We’ve been separated for so long. Such a happy ending to the earth’s long, tragic history may appear just too good to be true. But there’s one thing that can keep hope alive in our hearts. And that’s simply Jesus’ promise to return. Just before departing from His disciples into heaven, Jesus made this pledge:<br>
“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms; if it were not&nbsp; so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I WILL COME BACK and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.”-John 14:1-3. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Before ascended to heaven, He assured His followers, “I WILL COME BACK!” He promised to return and take all who trust in Him to the special place He has prepared for us. Scriptures speaks of His second coming approximately 2,500 times. The fact that Jesus is coming to the world a second time is as certain as the reality that He lived on this earth two thousand years ago. <br>
Long ago God promised that a Messiah would come, a Deliverer who would take on Himself our iniquities and provide pardon for human sin. That promise seemed too good to be true to many in the ancient world who were slogging through their lives. But Jesus did come and die on the cross. The promise came true more gloriously than people imagined possible. His promise to return will also come true. We can rely on the One who loves us, to return and gather up those for whom He has paid an infinite price.<br>
Throughout his imprisonment, Armando continued to smuggle poems, messages, and drawings to Martha. And she managed to publish some of these writings. Their eloquence attracted world attention. Government began pressuring Castro to release prisoners of conscience. The French president intervened and at last in October of 1982 Armando was placed on a plane headed for Paris. He hardly dared believe he was free-even after the plane touched down. But then, after two decades of suffering and longing and waiting, Armando rushed into Martha’s arms.<br>
A few months later the happy couple stood in Miami’s St. Kieran Church and repeated their vows. At last their union was complete. The promise was fulfilled: “I will come to you.”<br>
Can you imagine what a wonderful reunion it will be when finally we are able to see Christ face-to-face? His glorious appearing will swallow up all our sorrows and frustrations, wipe away all the pain that we’ve kept hidden in our hearts. Jesus’ return will fulfill our deepest longings and most exciting expectations. And we’ll embark on an eternity of intimate union with the most wonderful personality in the Universe. <br>
Jesus is coming soon! Are you eager to meet Him?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
(1)Will Jesus come in secret?<br>
“See, I [Jesus] have told you ahead of time. So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the desert,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. FOR AS LIGHTNING that comes from the east IS VISIBLE even in the west, SO WILL BE THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.”-Matthew 24:25-27.<br>
Lightning flashes out very visibly for great distances, so the coming of Jesus will not be some secret or subjective event.<br>
(2)Will Jesus come again as a real person?<br>
“They [Jesus’ followers] were looking intently up into the sky as he [Jesus] was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. ‘Men of Galilee,’ they said, ‘why do you stand here looking into the sky? THIS SAME JESUS, who has been TAKEN from you INTO HEAVEN, WILL COME BACK IN THE SAME WAY you have seen him go into heaven.’ “-Acts 1:10-11.<br>
On the day of His departure from our world the angels assured the disciples that the “same Jesus” taken up into heaven-not someone else-would come back in person as King of Kings. The same Jesus who healed the sick and opened blind eyes. The same Jesus who spoke gently to the woman taken in adultery. The same Jesus who wiped away mourner’s tears and welcomed children into His lap. The same Jesus who died on Calvary’s cross, rested in the grave, and rose form the dead the third day. <br>
(3)Will Jesus come so we can see Him?<br>
“Look, he is coming with the clouds, and EVERY EYE WILL SEE HIM.”-Revelation 1:7 (first part).<br>
All who are alive when Jesus comes again, both the righteousness and the wicked, will witness His return.<br>
How many did Jesus Himself say would view His return?<br>
“At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH will mourn. THEY WILL SEE the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.”-Matthew 24:30.<br>
Every living person on our globe will see Jesus return.<br>
(4)Who will accompany Jesus when He comes?<br>
“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory.”-Matthew 25:31.<br>
Imagine what it will be like when Jesus returns in all His splendor surrounded by “all angels.”<br>
(5)Can we predict the exact time of Jesus’ return?<br>
“No one knows about that day of hour, not event the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father…. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”-Matthew 24:36, 44.<br>
Everyone will see Jesus’ glorious arrival, but many will be unprepared for it. Are you personally ready for Jesus to come?<br>

“And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.”-Matthew 24:31.<br>
If you have allowed Jesus to prepare you in heart and life, you will greet Him joyfully as your Savior.<br>
(2)Jesus will awaken the righteous dead.<br>
“For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL RISE FIRST.”-1 Thessalonians 4:16.<br>
Jesus descends from heaven with a shout. His mighty voice is heard around the world. It breaks open graves in every cemetery and resurrects millions of people who have accepted Jesus through the ages. What an exhilarating day that will be!<br>
(3)Jesus will transform all the righteous at His coming-not only the righteous dead, but also the righteous living.<br>
“After that, we who are still alive and are left WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.”-Verse 17.<br>
To prepare us for eternity, Christ changes our mortal bodies that are subject to death into beautiful immortal bodies.<br>
“Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but WE WILL ALL BE CHANGED-in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, AT THE LAST TRUMPET. For the trumpet will sound, THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED IMPERISHABLE, and WE WILL BE CHANGED. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.”-1 Corinthians 15:51-53.<br>
When Jesus comes “we will all be changed.” Just think: no more arthritis, paralysis, or cancer. Shut down the hospitals and close up the funeral homes. Christ has come!<br>
(4)Jesus will take all the righteous people to heaven.<br>
Jesus Himself made the promise, “I will come back and take you to be with me” in My Father’s house (see John 14:1-3). Peter speaks of the inheritance of the redeemed “kept in heaven for you” (1 Peter 1:4). We can look forward to exploring the marvels of God’s city, the New Jerusalem, and getting to know our heavenly Father.<br>
(5)Jesus will eliminate evil and suffering for all time.<br>
The wicked-those who have persistently rejected all of Jesus’ offers of mercy-actually pass sentence on themselves. As they stare at Jesus’ face coming toward them from the clouds, a sudden awareness of their sin proves too painful to bear; they cry to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!” (Revelation 6:16). They prefer death to standing before Jesus’ all-seeing gaze.<br>
They know that the voice now thundering from the sky once tenderly implored them to accept divine grace. Those who lost themselves in the mad rush after money or pleasure or position now realize they’ve neglected the only really worthwhile thing in life.<br>
It is a crushing revelation. After all, not one of them needed to be lost. God Himself finds “no pleasure in the death of the wicked” (Ezekiel 33:11). He is “not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9). Jesus implores us, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). But, incredibly, some turn aside His gracious invitation.<br>

It cost Jesus a great deal to guarantee us a glorious future with Him “in my Father’s house.” It cost Him His life!<br>
“CHRIST WAS SACRIFICED ONCE to take away the sins of many people; and HE WILL APPEAR A SECOND TIME, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.”-Hebrews 9:28.<br>
The Savior who died on the cross to take away your sins will appear “a second time,” and He will “bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.” Christ sacrificed Himself in order to offer salvation to each of us. But without the Second Coming, the cross would be a failure. Christ wants to give us an eternally secure home with Him. In order for that to happen, we must allow Him to rule in our hearts as Savior and Lord right now.<br>
On the morning of August 16, 1945 a small boy ran through the Shantung Compound in North China shouting that he’d spotted a plane in the sky. All the able-bodied internees ran outside and looked up. These men and women had suffered through years of isolation, deprivation, and anxiety, imprisoned by the Japanese as citizens of enemy nations. For many only one thing had kept them spiritually alive: the hope that someday the war would end.<br>
An electric current shot through the crowd of 1500 surviving internees as they realized this plane might be coming for THEM. As the hum of the aircraft grew louder, someone yelled, “Look, there’s the AMERICAN FLAG painted on the side!” and then in an unbelieving daze, voices cried out, “Look, they’re WAVING at us! They know who we are. They’re coming to get us.”<br>
At this point the excitement was more than these ragged, weary, homesick survivors could contain. Pandemonium broke loose. People were running in circles, shouting at the top of their lungs, waving their arms and weeping.<br>
Suddenly the crowd gasped and stared in silence. The underside of the plane suddenly opened and men began floating down in parachutes. Their rescuers weren’t just coming someday; they were coming today, NOW to be in their midst!<br>
The crowd surged toward the compound gate. No one paused to think of the machine guns pointed down from towers. After years of frustration and loneliness, they broke through the gate and rushed to where the paratroopers were landing.<br>
Soon this flood of humanity turned and poured back into camp-with the soldiers on their shoulders. The camp commander surrendered without a fight. The war was indeed over. Freedom had come. The world was brand-new again.<br>
Soon OUR God, OUR Savior, will descend from the clouds to rescue us. The long horror story of man’s cruelty to man will finally cease. There will be jubilation on that day, shouts of joy as we finally understand: “He’s coming close; I can see the angels blowing their trumpets.” The sound gets louder, the cloud of glory brighter, until we can hardly endure it. But we can’t stop looking as we realize: “He sees me. He knows who I am.” We’ll know with indescribable joy: “This is my God. He’s coming for me, not someday, but today, right now.”<br>
Are you ready to welcome the King in all His glory? If not, please invite Jesus personally into your life just now. Even as the coming of Jesus to our world will solve the world’s problems, so His coming into your heart will help you deal with your present daily problems. The great Problem Solver can deliver you from guilt and burden of sin and give you eternal life.<br>
The coming of Jesus into a life can forever change it as dramatically as the coming Jesus to our world will transform it. You can depend on Jesus. He will prepare you for His coming and give the wonderful assurance of a life of eternal happiness.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
When Marco Polo returned to his hometown of Venice after many years in the Orient, his friends thought his long journeys had driven him mad. He had such incredible tales to tell.<br>
Marco had traveled to a city full of silver and gold. He’d seen black stones that burned, but no one had ever heard of coal. He’d seen a cloth that refused to catch fire even when thrown into the flames, but no one had ever heard of asbestos. He talked of huge serpents ten paces long with jaws wide enough to swallow a man, nuts the size of a man’s head and white as milk inside, and a substance spurting from the ground that actually set lamps alight. But no one had ever seen crocodiles, coconuts, or crude oil. They just laughed at such stories. Years later, when Marco lay dying, a devout man at his bedside urged him to recant all the tall tales he’s told. But Marco refused: “It’s all true-every bit of it. In fact, I have not told half of what I saw.”<br>
The Bible writers who give us glimpses of heaven seem to echo Marco Polo’s sentiment. In vision they looked on a place so brilliant, so fantastic, that they could describe only a fraction of what they saw. And we face a challenge similar to that of Marco Polo’s friends. We must try to imagine the “crocodiles and coconuts” that we’ve never seen, because the glimpses we do get in the Bible show us that heaven is much more than sitting on clouds and playing on harps.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Jesus is preparing a very real place for us right now in a very real heaven.<br>
“Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me [Jesus]. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I GO TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I WILL COME AGAIN, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”-John 14:1-3, KJV. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Jesus is coming to our world a second time to take us to a custom-made mansion in a heavenly city that is glorious beyond our wildest dreams: the New Jerusalem.<br>
After we’ve lived there for a thousand years, Christ intends to bring this heavenly home down to planet Earth. As the New Jerusalem descends, fire will purify the entire world. Our renewed planet then becomes the permanent home of the saved. (Revelation 20:7-15. More about this in Guide 22.)<br>
What does John, who wrote Revelation, picture next?<br>
“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‘Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.’“-Revelation 21:1-3.<br>
After its transformation by fire, who does Jesus promise will occupy the new earth?<br>
“Blessed are the meek: for they will inherit the earth.”-Matthew 5:5. (See also Revelation 21:7.)<br>
Christ promises to restore His once perfect world to its original Edenic beauty, and the meek “will inherit the earth.”<br>

When Jesus appeared to His disciples in His resurrected and glorified body, how did He describe it?<br>
“Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”-Luke 24:39.<br>
Jesus had a real body; He invited Thomas to touch Him (John 20:27). On this occasion Jesus walked into a real house, talked to real people, and ate real food (Luke 24:43).<br>
Heaven isn’t inhabited by ghost, but by real people who enjoy a spiritual life, and who have a “glorious body.”<br>
“But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.”-Philippians 3: 20, 21.<br>
We can be assured that our heavenly bodies will be as solid and real as Christ’s resurrected body.<br>
Will we recognize our family and friends in heaven?<br>
“Now we see but poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.”-1 Corinthians 13:12.<br>
In heaven we “shall know fully.” We’ll understand and appreciate one another more deeply than we ever have in this present world.<br>
Jesus’ disciples recognized Him in His heavenly body, apparently because of His familiar features (Luke 24:36-43). Mary knew Him at the tomb because of the familiar sound of His voice when He called her by name (John 20:14-16). The two disciples at Emmaus identified Him because of certain familiar gestures. When they noticed the way their guest blessed the food, they recognized Him as the Lord by His manner (Luke 24:13-35).<br>
The redeemed are certain to experience thrilling “face-t-face” reunions in heaven. Imagine the joy of recognizing your spouse’s special smile, or the familiar call of a child you laid to rest long ago, or the endearing gestures of some beloved friend. We’ll have an eternity to deepen-life’s most precious bonds and to develop intimate friendship with the most fascinating personalities in the universe.<br>

We’ll have plenty of activities to challenge us in heaven. How about designing your own dream house?<br>
“Behold, I will create new heavens a new earth…. I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people…. They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit…. My chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands.”-Isaiah 65:17-22.<br>
Jesus is already preparing personalized homes for us in the Holy City, the New Jerusalem (John 14:1-3, Revelation 21). These verses suggest we’ll also design and construct other houses-perhaps beautiful country estates, landscaping them with heaven’s rich variety of plant life. And who knows what high-tech adventures await us in God’s advanced civilization? Our present scientific breakthroughs and space odysseys will seem like child’s play when we begin exploring in our “Father’s house.”<br>
Do you love the beauty of thundering waterfalls, quiet meadows, teeming rain foresees, and delicate blossoms?<br>
“The LORD will surely comfort Zion;… he will make her deserts like Eden, her wastelands like the garden of the LORD. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the sound of singing.”-Isaiah 51:3.<br>
God will transform the earth into a pristine Garden of Eden. No more oil spills or smog or drought; the lakes stay crystal clear, the trees majestic, and the mountainsides unscarred.<br>
Not only the beauties of the world, but also our capacity to absorb them will be greatly intensified. It will seem like that first day outdoors after a very long illness. And the first “twenty minutes of reality” will extend into a magical eternity.<br>
Do you enjoy experiencing new things? Learning? Creating?<br>
“There, immortal minds will contemplate with never failing delight the wonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeeming love….Every faculty will be developed, every capacity increased. The acquirement of knowledge will not weary the mind or exhaust the energies. There the grandest enterprises may be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations reached, the highest ambitions realized; and still there will arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of minds and soul and body. All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God’s redeemed.”-Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy (Nampa, Idaho; Pacific Press Publishing Association, 1950), page 677.<br>

“Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.”-Revelation 21:27.<br>
God is going to completely eliminate sin and its terrible results; they will never appear again. When Jesus appears, “we shall be like Him” (1 John 3:2). Instead of resisting impulses to kill, steal, lie, or rape, we’ll pursue heavenly graces. <br>
“[God] will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”-Revelation 21:4.<br>
Even the ultimate enemy, death, will vanish. In heaven’s land of eternal youth the redeemed are “immortal” (1 Corinthians 15:53); no inhabitant will ever suffer the ravages of old age. <br>
Heaven not only destroys the results of sin, it also reverses them. Imagine what it will be like for those who’ve struggled with lifelong handicaps:<br>
“Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy.”-Isaiah 35:5, 6.<br>

Imagine seeing the Lord of the Universe face-to-face.<br>
“Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.”-Revelation 21:3.<br>
God Almighty promises to be our companion and tutor. What a joy to sit at His feet! Think what a musician might give to be able to spend a few moments with Beethoven or Mozart. Imagine how much a physicist would treasure the chance to sit down with Albert Einstein, or how much it would mean for a painter to talk with Michelangelo or Rembrandt.<br>
Just think, the redeemed will have an infinitely greater privilege. They will converse with the Author of all music, science, and art. They will be on intimate terms with the greatest Mind and deepest Heart in the universe. And this relationship will overflow into worship.<br>
“From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,’ says the LORD.”-Isaiah 66:23.<br>
In the center of the heavenly city stands the great white throne of God. Encircled by an emerald rainbow, His face shines like a blazing sun. Below His feet a glassy sea extends in all direction. On this crystal surface reflecting God’s glory, the redeemed gather to pour out their exultant praise. <br>
“And the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.”-Isaiah 35:10.<br>
Here is Someone whose goodness never misses a beat. His faithfulness and patience and compassion just keep rolling on. Praise His holy name!<br>

Jesus longs for that face-to-face meeting. That’s why He was willing to rescue you from sin at such great cost. You must personally take advantage of this gift. You must make a commitment to Christ as Lord and Savior. You need the pardon that is offered from the cross, because:<br>
“Nothing impure will ever enter [the New Jerusalem], nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.”-Revelation 21:27.<br>
Jesus delivers us from sin, not in sin. We must come to Him through His power in us and be separated from the impure and the unholy. Jesus is our password into His soon-coming kingdom.<br>
And that kingdom can have its beginning right now in your heart. When Christ delivers us from sin, He creates a little heaven within. He can help us deal with the worry, anger, lust, fear, and guilt that plague us. The hope of heaven isn’t an escape from life’s problems; it helps create more heaven on earth. A recently conducted poll showed that “those who believe in life after death lead happier lives and trust people more than those who don’t.”<br>
Nothing will have a more dramatic impact on your life right now than a trusting relationship with Jesus Christ. Listen to how Peter describes the impact of a living faith:<br>
“Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are FILLED WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE AND GLORIOUS JOY, for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.”-1 Peter 1:8, 9.<br>
All of this-and heaven too. Have you discovered the kind of abundant life Christ wants you to experience? Please don’t turn away from His gracious invitation.<br>
“The [Holy] Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come!’ And let him who hears say, ‘Come!’ Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.”-Revelation 22:17.<br>
Jesus is with you now, speaking to your heart as you read these lines. He invites you to “Come!” “Come!” “Come!” He couldn’t be more eager, more insistent. If you have not yet done so, this moment above all others is your opportunity to explore His offer.<br>
Why not tell Him that you accept His gracious gift and want to spend eternity with Him? Tell Him that you love Him. Thank Him for all He has done for you and all He is still planning for you. If there is something between you and God, ask Him to make you willing to remove it. Today, while you hear His voice, while your heart is still responsive, give yourself to Him without reserve. Bow your head at this moment and say, “Jesus, my Lord, I come. I give my all to You. I will be Yours forever.”<br>

Most of us have an almost instinctive urge to peek into the future. We want to know what lies beyond the horizon. But accurate predictions remain terribly elusive. We have a difficult enough time forecasting tomorrow’s weather!<br>
There is Someone, however, whose prophecies have proven remarkably accurate. Jesus Christ, through His Word, can take us into the future; He’s a reliable guide. In this lesson we’re going to look at what He had to say about His second coming. After all, who could know more about the end of the world than the One who created it in the beginning?<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
After Jesus assured His disciples that He would come back to our world a second time (Matthew 23:29), what question did they ask Him?<br>
“’Tell us,’ they said, ‘when will this happen, and what will be THE SIGN OF YOUR COMING and of the end of the age?’”-Matthew 24:3. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Jesus answered clearly and positively. In chapter 24 of Matthew and chapter 21 of Luke He personally gave several “signs,” or evidences, by which we can know when His coming is near. Other Bible prophecies help fill out the picture, detailing world conditions just before Christ’s return. As we’ll see, these prophecies are being fulfilled before our very eyes; they indicate that Christ’s coming back to earth is near at hand.<br>
Let’s look at ten signposts of Bible prophecy along the highway to heaven, and examine the questions that a modern-day traveler might ask as he reads them.<br>
Signpost 1-Anguish! Terror! Perplexity!<br>
Over nineteen hundred years ago Jesus gave a prophetic description of contemporary life that sounds as if it could have been taken from the evening news:<br>
“There will be SIGNS in the sun, moon, and stars. On the earth, NATIONS WILL BE IN ANGUISH AND PERPLEXITY at the roaring and tossing of the sea. MEN WILL FAINT FROM TERROR, APPREHENSIVE OF WHAT IS COMING ON THE WORLD, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. AT THAT TIME THEY WILL SEE THE SON OF MAN COMING in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”-Luke 21: 25-28.<br>
No more accurate description of today’s world could be penned than: “Men will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world.” Stockpiled weapons are capable of destroying the entire planet. What if some terrorist gets a nuclear warhead?<br>
Jesus gives us a basis for hope in a calamitous age. The current crisis of global “anguish and perplexity” only reinforces the truth that Christ’s coming really is “drawing near.” People today often moan in frustration, “Look what the world has come to!” but the student of Bible prophecy can exclaim with hopeful voice, “Look WHO is coming to our world.”<br>
Signpost 2-World Calamities.<br>
How do natural disasters fit into last-day events?<br>
“There will be great EARTHQUAKES, FAMINES and PESTILENCES in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven…. When you see these things happening, you know that THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NEAR.”-Luke 21:11, 31.<br>
Think about famines for a moment. Images of starving kids with distended bellies persist on the news. Isn’t it rather amazing that a world which can send men to the moon, CANNOT feed all its people? Jesus knew that famines would persist, that selfish human nature would grow worse toward the end of time.<br>
But what about earthquakes? According to World Almanac of 1999, in century after century of the Christian era there has been a striking increase in major earthquakes: 18th century 6 major earthquakes, 19th century 7, 20th century more than 100. So the evidence grows more dramatic as we get nearer and nearer to our present day.<br>
These figures confirm Jesus’ prophecy. Famines and major earthquakes are reaching a crescendo—“the kingdom of God is near!” Will our 21st century bring hundreds more major earthquakes, or the coming of the King of Kings?<br>
Signpost 3-Accumulating Wealth.<br>
What is the meaning of wealth slipping into the hands of fewer and fewer while more and more fall into poverty?<br>
“You have hoarded wealth in the last days.”-James 5:3.<br>
Despite all our economic insights, the rich keep getting richer and the poor poorer. The multi-million dollar fortunes are another signpost that show us “the Lord’s coming is near” (verse 8).<br>
Signpost 4-Civil Unrest.<br>
Why have discontent and unrest among employees risen so dramatically?<br>
“Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. THE CRIES OF THE HARVESTERS [WORKERS] have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. Be patient and stand firm, because THE LORD’S COMING IS NEAR.”-James 5:4, 8.<br>
After predicting an unparalleled piling up of wealth in our day, James foresaw civil unrest arising from discontented workers. The tension between the “haves” and the “have-not’s” continues to increase. Another sign that “the Lord’s coming is near.”<br>
Signpost 5-Moral Decay. <br>
Why does the moral fiber of society seem to be shredding?<br>
“But mark this: There will be TERRIBLE TIMES IN THE LAST DAYS. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God-having a form of godliness but denying its power…. EVIL MEN AND IMPOSTORS WILL GO FROM BAD TO WORSE, deceiving and being deceived.”-2 Timothy 3:1-5, 13.<br>
Could anyone think of a more accurate description of our world? Point a camera in any direction these days and you’ll catch a picture of arrogant materialism. You’ll capture a shocking epidemic of child abuse and molestation. You’ll get countless scenes of youth out of control, kids in their early teens killing and maiming at random. All these things form a gallery of pictures loudly proclaiming that Jesus’ coming is very near.<br>
Signpost 6-Spread of the Occult.<br>
Why are we seeing an explosion of interest in the occult?<br>
“For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect-if that were possible.”-Matthew 24:24.<br>
These passages predict that the time of the end will feature all kinds of miracles and signs, a counterfeit manifestation of the supernatural. Witches and warlocks appear on talk shows. New Agers are everywhere, selling magic crystals and channeling departed spirits. Counterfeit signs and wonders are booming. All this makes it even clearer that just as Jesus predicted, we are living in the time of “the coming of the Son of Man” (verse 27).<br>
Signpost 7-An Awakened World.<br>
What is the meaning of the awakening to world-consciousness of Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the nations of the Far East?<br>
“LET THE NATIONS BE ROUSED;… Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe… so great is their wickedness!’ Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR in the valley of decision.”-Joel 3:12-14.<br>
Today in Asia and Africa, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Middle Eastern countries, we are witnessing perhaps the most widespread awakening of individual nations in all of recorded history, “for the day of the Lord is near.”<br>
Signpost 8-Peace Plans and War Preparations.<br>
We live in a strange world. Everyone agrees that we should give peace a chance. We talk peace; yet pent up hostilities, some centuries old, flare into open conflict. The prophets Micah and Joel predicted that at the very time the nations talk about their desire for peace (Micah 4:1-3), distrust for their neighbors compels them to prepare for war (Joel 3:9-13)<br>
Long ago the Bible pictured our present peace-war dilemma, and declared that permanent peace will reign on earth only when Jesus comes.<br>
Signpost 9-Modern Progress.<br>
Why, after centuries of human history have transportation and communication brought the world so close together?<br>
“UNTIL THE TIME OF THE END, many will go here and there to increase knowledge.”-Daniel 12:4.<br>
Daniel here indicates that knowledge of his prophecies would increase “in” (KJV), or “until the time of the end.” But this prediction also seems to point straight to our computerized information age. Knowledge of all kinds has increased at lightning speed these past few years. There have been more changes in the past fifty years than in the previous two thousand.<br>
“MANY WILL GO HERE AND THERE to increase knowledge.” Before 1850, people moved around by horse and buggy, pretty much as they had from the beginning of time. Now we break the sound barrier and span the globe in everything from Concorde airplanes to space shuttles.<br>
Increased travel and the recent flood of inventions give further evidence that we’re living in “the time of the end”.<br>
Signpost 10-Gospel to All the World.<br>
Jesus predicted that just before His coming the gospel would reach the whole world:<br>
“And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”-Matthew 24:14.<br>
For decades almost half the globe was locked behind an iron curtain, shut away from the Good News. But then almost overnight Eastern Europe slipped from the iron grip of communism. The Berlin Wall came crashing down, and the mighty Soviet Empire fell apart. Suddenly roughly half the planet was opening its arms to the gospel.<br>
The gospel is truly going to the “whole world” as never before. By satellite the Christian message is simultaneously being broadcast to almost every nation. We are living in the very day Jesus spoke of when He declared: “This gospel will be preached in the whole world” and “then the end will come.”<br>

After describing the events that were to characterize the time just preceding His second coming, Jesus concludes His remarks by saying,<br>
“I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.”-Matthew 24:34.<br>
The conclusion is obvious-the generation portrayed by these signposts of prophecy will see Jesus return to earth a second time. It won’t be long until He’ll sweep away sin and suffering, and establish His everlasting kingdom. Jesus cautions, “No one knows… that day or hour” (verse 36).<br>
And Jesus continues:<br>
“You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”-Matthew 24:44.<br>

Christ is the last, best hope for our world because only He can deal with the very thing that is destroying it-sin. Jesus died on Calvary to make possible the defeat of evil and deliverance for all who respond to His offer of salvation.<br>
“He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.”-1 John 3:8.<br>
Our Savior created a way out of our crumbling world by sacrificing His own flesh and blood. And the same Jesus, who will someday cure all the world’s ills by destroying sin, offers right now to erase the guilt of sin from your life. You don’t have to wait for the Second Coming to find release from guilt, and from anxiety and destructive behavior. Jesus is quite willing to give you His kind of peace this very moment.<br>
While attending a religious meeting a young woman felt strangely moved by the gospel presentation. As she heard the story of a soon-coming Savior unfold, all the pieces began to fit into place. This made sense. She decided that she’d been looking for love, happiness, and peace in all the wrong places. Jesus had to be the answer.<br>
The next day when the evangelist and his associate went to see her, she poured out the story of a bitter and broken life. She’d sunk to the bottom as an alcoholic, and was supporting herself through prostitution. After describing her problems, she sobbed out, “You were really speaking to me last night.”<br>
But the voice that had reached her heart was the voice of God. And He was speaking tenderly. She decided to lay it all on the line. She invited Christ to come into her heart as Savior and Lord, and fastened onto the hope of His soon return.<br>
In the weeks that followed, she began to notice that her many fears and insecurities, which she’d always tried to drown in drink, now found release as she spent time communicating with Jesus. He began to deliver her from the compulsions that had been wrecking her life.<br>
She had done a lot of things she wasn’t proud of. But Christ’s grace and forgiveness proved stronger than her shame. The experience of the thief on the cross meant a lot to her. In his last, desperate hours he turned to the Innocent Sufferer beside him asked, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom” (Luke 23:42).<br>
Jesus immediately answered by promising the thief a place with Him in paradise (verse 43). The same Jesus who graciously offered forgiveness to that dying thief, now offers you salvation, complete pardon, and peace of mind. Discover it for yourself today. <br>
You too can pray with the dying thief: “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” And Jesus will answer, “I will come again, and you will be with Me in paradise.”<br>

In 1929 Frank Morris boarded a ship bound for Switzerland. He’d looked forward to this voyage for some time. But it turned into a humiliating experience. A steward put in charge of his care locked Frank in his cabin each night. After a quick breakfast Frank could exercise a bit, but felt foolish being led around the deck, like an animal on a leash. Then the steward deposited Frank in a steamer chair. Whenever he met a friendly passenger who invited him for a stroll, the steward objected, saying he had to keep an eye on him.<br>
Frank was an adult, with the normal curiosities and desires of an adult. But he was also blind. The steward assumed he couldn’t take care of himself. Frank was treated like a parcel that had to be lugged around.<br>
But in Switzerland Frank’s life dramatically changed. While there he learned about dogs which had been trained to guide the blind. Bringing German shepherd named Buddy back to the United States, Frank started Seeing Eye, now a worldwide organization.<br>
Now, with Buddy at his side, Frank could go anywhere, anytime, with anyone. He felt free at last. During one demonstration to a group of reporters at a busy cross street in New York City, Buddy guided his master expertly from one lane to the other while cars whizzed past. Because he trusted Buddy, Frank made it across with ease. The sighted reporters had a much more difficult time; one actually took a cab to get to the other side.<br>
In the next few pages we’re going to learn about the Holy Spirit, a Guide who wants us to place our lives in his hands. All of us are handicapped by the same human nature, the same blindness to what’s really most important. Life rushes by us at such a frantic pace that we often find ourselves just coping instead of going anywhere. Still, we’re hesitant to trust our lives completely to this Guide. But the discovery that awaits each of us is this: we’ll find real freedom and power by depending on the Holy Spirit to guide us through life.<br>

When Christ was about to ascend into heaven, He promised His disciples a priceless gift:<br>
“But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, THE COUNSLEOR will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.... When he, THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH, comes, HE WILL GUIDE YOU into all truth…. HE WILL BRING GLORY TO ME by taking from what is mine and making it known to you.”-John 16:7, 13, 14. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
In the divine plan, Jesus needed to return to heaven as our representative before God’s throne and “appear for us in God’s presence” (Hebrews 9:24). While our crucified Lord represents us in heaven, we also have the Holy Spirit as our COUNSELOR and GUIDE right here on earth. He is Jesus’ direct representative.<br>
While here Jesus ministered within the confines of a human body, and couldn’t be present everywhere. But the Holy Spirit was no such limitations; He can serve as a personal Counselor and Guide to countless individuals in many places at the same time. Christ meets our needs through the Holy Spirit.<br>

Most of us can relate to God the Father if we imagine the most caring, nurturing parent we have ever known. And we can picture Jesus the Son, because He lived among us as a person. But the Holy Spirit is harder to picture and relate to. We have no easy human comparisons. The Bible, however, does give us specific information about the Holy Spirit:<br>
A Personality. Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as a person, a member of the Godhead, along with God the Father and God the Son:<br>
“Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the FATHER and of the SON and of the HOLY SPIRIT.”-Matthew 28:19.<br>
The Spirit has personal characteristics: a mind (Romans 8:27); wisdom (1 Corinthians 2:10); feelings of love toward us (Romans 15:30); feelings of grief when we sin (Ephesians 4:30); the ability to teach us (Nehemiah 9:20); and power to guide us. <br>
Involvement in Creation. The Holy Spirit participated in the forming of our world with the Father and the Son.<br>
“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth…. And the SPIRIT OF GOD moved upon the face of the waters.”-Genesis 1:1, 2, KJV. <br>
                                                      <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
(1)Changing the human heart. In His encounter with Nicodemus, Jesus emphasized the role of the Holy Spirit in changing the human heart:<br>
“I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is BORN OF water and THE SPIRIT.”-John 3:5.<br>
To be “born of the Spirit” means that the Spirit gives us a new beginning. It’s more than a matter of modifying our behavior a bit. The Spirit changes us from the inside out, fulfilling the promise: “I will give you a new heart” (Ezekiel 36:26).<br>
(2)Making us aware of wrongdoing and giving us a desire for holiness.<br>
“When he [the Holy Spirit] comes, HE WILL CONVICT the world of guilt in regard to SIN and RIGHTEOUSNESS and judgment.”-John 16:8.<br>
When you hear the dramatic story of someone turning from an immoral lifestyle to God and becoming a faithful spouse and nurturing parent, remember that every step toward wholeness came as a result of the prompting of the Holy Spirit.<br>
(3)Guiding us in our Christian life. Christ speaks to us directly through the “still small <br>
voice” of the Spirit.<br>
“Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, ‘This is the way; walk in it.’”-Isaiah 30:21.<br>
Through satellite transmission, our TVs regularly bring images and faces from a continent away into our living room. The Holy Spirit functions a little like God’s satellite, bringing the presence of Christ from heaven to earth, making Him close when we need Him most (John 14:15-20).<br>
(4)Aiding our prayer life.<br>
“We do not know what we ought to pray for, BUT THE SPIRIT HIMSELF INTERCEDES FOR US with groans that words cannot express… in accordance with God’s will.”-Romans 8:26, 27.<br>
When we are struggling to find the words, the Spirit is praying in our behalf. When we are so discouraged we can only groan toward God, the Spirit amplifies our faint cry for help into a powerful prayer before the very throne of God where Jesus is now ministering. <br>
(5)Developing Christian qualities and character. The Spirit makes spiritually barren <br>
individuals as fertile as a tree bearing all kinds of fruit:<br>
“BUT THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.”-Galatians 5:22-23.<br>
Having the fruit of the Spirit demonstrates that we are grafted into the true vine, Jesus (John 15:5). Jesus can actually live His abundant life through us by the power of the Spirit.<br>
(6)Preparing us as witnesses. Jesus promises:<br>
“YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER when the HOLY SPIRIT comes on you; and you will be MY WITNESSES… to the ends of the earth.”-Acts 1:8.<br>
All who are willing can be made witnesses by the Spirit. We may not have all the answers, but the Spirit can give us a story to tell that moves hearts and minds. The apostles had trouble communicating before Pentecost, but after the Spirit came they proclaimed Christ with such power that they “turned the world upside down” (Acts 17:6, KJV).<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Scripture makes a distinction between God’s gift of the Holy Spirit to every believer for victorious Christian living, and the various gifts of the Spirit provided to believers for effective ministry in different ways.<br>
“When he [Christ] ascended on high, he led captives in his train and GAVE GIFTS to men’… It was he who gave SOME to be APOSTLES, some to be PROPHETS, some to be EVANGELISTS, and some to be PASTORS and TEACHERS, to prepare God’s people for works of service.”-Ephesians 4:8, 11-12.<br>
Each Christian does not receive all the gifts, some may receive more gifts than others; the Spirit “gives them to each one, just as he determines” (1 Corinthians 12:11). The Spirit equips each believer for his or her special role in God’s plan. God knows when and where to provide the gifts that will best bless His people and His church.<br>
Another list of spiritual gifts found in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 includes wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, prophecy, speaking in different kinds of tongues, [languages, margin], and the interpretation of languages (verses 8-10).<br>
Paul urges us to “eagerly desire the greater gifts” then adds, “and now I will show you the most excellent way.” (1 Corinthians 12:31). The love chapter (1 Corinthians 13) that follows this verse emphasizes that “the most excellent way” is the way of love. And love is the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22).<br>
Our concern should be to seek the fruit of the Spirit and then let the Spirit distribute His gifts to us as “he determines” (1 Corinthians 12:11).<br>

On the Day of Pentecost, the Spirit was poured out in unlimited measure, fulfilling Jesus’ promise:<br>
“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses… to the ends of the earth.”-Acts 1:8.<br>
At Pentecost the Spirit enabled the apostles to communicate the gospel clearly in the languages of people “from every nation under heaven” (Acts 2:3-6).<br>
Some Bible students compare the coming of the Spirit to the falling of the early autumn and the late spring rains of Palestine (Joel 2:23). The Spirit falling at Pentecost was like the “early rain” of autumn which caused the seeds to sprout and provided vital nourishment for the Christian church in its infancy.<br>

Bible prophecy tells of a day coming when the Spirit of God will be poured out like a shower on the church, energizing the church’s members as witnesses (Joel 2: 28, 29). Centuries have now passed and the story of salvation has spread over a large part of the earth. It’s now time for the “latter rain” to ripen the grain, making it ready to harvest.<br>
As history moves to a climax just before Christ’s second coming, God will prepare every sincere believer for heaven through a great outpouring of His Spirit. Are you now experiencing the “early rain” that is preparing the church for the “latter rain” of the Spirit? Are you living a Spirit-filled life? As you are empowered by the Spirit, will you let God use you to communicate the news of His incredible love and soon return?<br>

At Pentecost the Holy Spirit moved those who heard the gospel to cry out, “Brothers, what shall we do?” (Acts 2:37).<br>
“Peter replied, ‘REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. AND YOU WILL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.’”-Acts 2:38.<br>
Repentance-turning away from a sinful way of life and turning to Christ-is a condition for receiving the gift of the Spirit. To have the Spirit poured out on us, we must first repent and commit our lives to Christ. Jesus also emphasized the willingness to follow Him and obey Him as a condition for receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit (John 14:15-17).<br>

Before leaving the world, Jesus instructed His followers:<br>
“Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the GIFT my Father promised… For John BAPTIZED WITH WATER, but in a few days you will be BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT.”-Acts 1:4, 5.<br>
Over and over the Scripture indicates that the Christian is to be “filled with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 2:4; 4:8, 4:31; 6:3, 6:5; 7:55; 9:17; 13:9, 13:52; 19:6). The Holy Spirit makes the life of a Christian fulfilling and beautiful because a Spirit-filled life achieves Christ’s ideal for us.<br>
While describing the Spirit-filled Christian life, Paul offered this prayer for every believer:<br>
“I pray that out of his glorious riches HE MAY STRENGTHEN YOU WITH POWER THROUGH HIS SPIRIT IN YOUR INNER BEING, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith…. Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, ACCORDING TO HIS POWER THAT IS AT WORK WITHIN US.”-Ephesians 3:16, 17, 20.<br>
Like Frank Morris with his faithful guide dog Buddy, we can, with the Holy Spirit guide inside us, do immeasurably more than we could before. With new desires and new abilities we are enabled to move forward confidently instead of just trying to cope with life’s problems.<br>
This Spirit-filled experience is renewed each day through prayer and Bible study. Prayer keeps us in close contact with Christ, and studying the Word of God keeps us focused on His resources. They break down any barrier between us and Christ that might prevent Him from pouring out His priceless Gift of the Spirit. This is how we grow and replace bad habits and attitudes with healthy qualities.<br>
Romans 8 gives an exciting description of the Spirit-filled life. Read it when you can, and note now many times Paul points to the “Spirit” as the power behind the Christian life.<br>
Have you made the wonderful discovery of the Spirit-filled life? Are you conscious of the presence of the Spirit in your life? Are you experiencing His life-giving power? Open up your life to the greatest power in the universe.<br>

When a Scottish lad named Peter got lost in a grassy wasteland on an inky black night, God called him by name: “Peter!” When the heavenly voice called out again, Peter stopped in his tracks, looked down, and discovered he was a step away from plunging into an abandoned limestone quarry.<br>
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could each hear God calling us by name? Wouldn’t it be great if He were that close a companion-if we could actually sit down together and have a long chat about our struggles and dreams?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Believe it or not, we can come nearer to Jesus now than we could if He actually lived here with us as a visible person. Having Christ in the flesh in our town would be wonderful of course, but think of the enormous crowds pressing for a closer look. Think of the demands on His time. We would do well to get a few minutes of direct conversation in lifetime.<br>
Christ wishes to cultivate a personal relationship with every one of us. That’s one reason why He left this earth for a special ministry in heaven that would allow Him to come near to each of us every day. Because Jesus is not limited to one place like when He was here on earth, through the Holy Spirit He is now near to guide the life of every willing person individually.<br>
What encouraging promise did Jesus give just before He ascended to heaven?<br>
“I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS, to the very end of the age.”-Matthew 28:20. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
What is Christ doing in heaven that makes it possible for Him to be “with you always”?<br>
“Therefore, since WE HAVE A GREAT HIGH PRIEST who has gone through the heavens, JESUS THE SONE OF GOD, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are- yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”-Hebrews 4:14-16.<br>
Note the assurances of having Jesus as our personal representative in heaven: “Tempted in every way, just as we are.” “Sympathize with our weaknesses.” “Help us in our time of need.” With Jesus as our High Priest we’re no longer cut off from a distant heaven; Christ can usher us into the very presence of God. No wonder we’re urged to “approach the throne of grace with confidence.”<br>
What place does Jesus occupy in heaven?<br>
“But when this priest [Jesus] had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD.”-Hebrews 10:12.<br>
The living Christ- someone who understands- is our personal representative on the throne “at the right hand of God.”<br>
How did the life of Jesus prepare Him to be our priest?<br>
“For this reason he had to be made like his BROTHERS in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, HE IS ABLE TO HELP those who are being tempted,”-Hebrews 2:17, 18.<br>
Our “brother” who shares our humanity and was “tempted” like we are, is now our High Priest at the Father’s right hand. “Made like” us, He knows what we’re going through. He’s been hungry, thirsty, tempted, and exhausted. He’s felt the need for sympathy and understanding.<br>
But above all, Jesus is qualified to be our High Priest because He died to “make atonement” for our sins. He paid the price for our sins by dying in our place. This is the Gospel, the Good News for all human beings everywhere and for all time.<br>
One of our Bible School directors shares this experience: “When our youngest daughter was three, she caught her finger in a folding chair, splintering the bone. As we rushed her to a doctor, her loud cries of pain really tore at our hearts. And they touched our five-year-old in a special way. I’ll never forget her words after the doctor had cared for her sister’s injury. She sobbed, ‘Oh, Daddy, I wish it could have been my finger!’”<br>
When all humanity were crushed by sin and condemned to die eternally, Jesus said, “Oh, Father, I wish it could have been Me.” And the Father gave Jesus His wish at the cross. Our Savior has experienced every agony we have suffered- and more!<br>

When the people of Israel camped at the foot of Mount Sinai, God instructed Moses to build a portable sanctuary for worship “according to the pattern shown you [Moses] on the mountain” (Exodus 25:40). Nearly 500 years later, King Solomon’s great stone temple replaced the portable sanctuary. And the temple was built on precisely the same plan as the portable sanctuary.<br>
When God gave Moses the direction for building the sanctuary, what specific purpose did He have in mind?<br>
“Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I WILL DWELL AMONG THEM.”-Exodus 25:8.<br>
Sin caused a tragic separation between human beings and their Creator. The sanctuary was God’s way of showing how He can again live among us. The sanctuary, and later the temple, became the center of religious life and worship in Old Testament times. Each morning and evening the people could gather around the sanctuary and establish contact with God in prayer (Luke 1:9, 10), claiming God’s promise: “I will meet with you” (Exodus 30:6).<br>
The Old Testament teaches the same gospel of salvation as does the New Testament. Both portray Jesus dying for us and ministering to us as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.<br>

The sanctuary and its services reveal what Jesus is doing now in the temple in heaven, and what He is doing now on earth to enrich and guide each of us in our daily lives. <br>
Since the earthly sanctuary was patterned after the temple in heaven, it reflects the heavenly sanctuary where Christ now ministers. Exodus 25-40 describes the services and ceremonies of the wilderness sanctuary in great detail. A brief summary of the sanctuary furnishings appears in the New Testament:<br>
“Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary…. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained… the stone tablets of the covenant [on which God wrote the Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 10:1-5)]. Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover [mercy seat].”-Hebrews 9:1-5.<br>
The sanctuary had two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. A courtyard was laid out in front of the sanctuary. In the court stood the brass altar on which the priests offered sacrifices, and the laver in which they washed.<br>
The sacrifices offered on the brass altar symbolized Jesus, who through His death on the cross became “the lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29). When the repentant sinner came to the altar with his sacrifice and confessed his sins, he received forgiveness and cleansing. In the same way, the sinner today obtains<br>
forgiveness and cleansing through the blood of Jesus (1John 1:9).<br>
In the first room, or Holy Place, the seven-branched lampstand burned continually, representing Jesus as the never-failing “light of the world” (John 8:12). The table of consecrated bread symbolized His satisfying our physical and spiritual hunger as the ever-present “Bread of Life” (John 6:35). The golden altar of incense represented Jesus’ prayer ministry for us in the very presence of God (Revelation 8: 3, 4).<br>
The second room, or Most Holy Place, contained the gold-covered ark of the covenant. It symbolized the throne of God. Its atonement cover, or mercy seat, represented the intercession of Christ, our High Priest, interceding on behalf of sinful human being who have broken God’s moral law. The two tablets of stone on which God wrote the Ten Commandments were kept below the mercy seat. Golden cherubim of glory hovered over the mercy seat on each end of the ark. A glorious light shone between these two cherubim, a symbol of the presence of God Himself.<br>
A curtain hid the Holy Place from the view of the people as the priests ministered to them in the courtyard. A second curtain in front of the Most Holy Place blocked this inner room from the priests who entered the sanctuary’s first room.<br>
When Jesus died on the cross, what happened to the curtain?<br>
“At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.”-Matthew 27:51.<br>
The Most Holy Place was exposed when Jesus died. After the death of Jesus no curtain can come between a holy God and a sincere believer; Jesus, our High Priest, ushers us into the very presence of God (Hebrews 10:19-22). We have access to the throne room of heaven because Jesus is our High Priest at God’s right hand. Jesus enables us to come into God’s presence-into the Father’s heart of love. So “let us draw near.”<br>

Just as the earthly sanctuary served as a miniature reproduction of the heavenly temple where Jesus now ministers for us, the services carried on in the earthly sanctuary were “a copy and shadow of what is in heaven” (Hebrews 8:5). But there is a striking difference: The priests who served in the earthly temple could not themselves forgive sin, but at the cross Jesus “appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself” (Hebrews 9:26).<br>
The Old Testament book of Leviticus describes in detail the services carried on in the sanctuary. The ceremonial rituals were divided into two parts: the daily services and the yearly services. (Guide 13 details with the yearly services.)<br>
In the daily services, the priests offered sacrifices for the individual and for the entire congregation. When a person sinned, he would bring an unblemished animal as a sin offering, “lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:29). The guilt of the sinner must be transferred to the guiltless animal by confession of sin and the laying on of hands. This symbolized Christ taking on our guilt at Calvary; the sinless One became “sin for us” (2 Corinthians 5:21). The sacrificial animal had to be killed and its blood shed because it pointed forward to the supreme penalty that Christ suffered on the cross.<br>

“Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness” (Hebrews 9:22). What happened in the Old Testament sanctuary pointed forward to Christ’s one great saving act. Having died for our sins, He entered the holy places “once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption” for us (verse 12). When Jesus’ blood was shed on the cross for our sins, “the curtain of the temple [in Jerusalem] was torn in two from top to bottom” (Matthew 27:51). Because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, animal sacrifices were no longer necessary.<br>
When Jesus spilled His blood from the cross, He was offering up His perfectly obedient life as a substitute for our failures. When the Father and Son were torn apart at Calvary, the Father turned away in anguish and the Son died of a broken heart. God the Son stepped into history to take on Himself the full results of sin and to demonstrate how tragic wrongdoing really is. He could then forgive sinners without trivializing sin. Christ made “peace through his blood, shed on the cross” (Corinthians 1:20)<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
What is Jesus’ day-to-day work in heavenly temple?<br>
“Therefore he is able also to save completely [forever, margin] those who come to God through him, because HE ALWAYS LIVES TO INTERCEDE for them.”-Hebrews 7:25.<br>
Jesus now “lives” to present His blood, His sacrifice, on our behalf. He is now working diligently to save every human being from the tragedy of sin. Some mistakenly assume that, as our Intercessor, Jesus is in heaven begging a reluctant God to forgive us. In fact, it is God who joyfully accepts His Son’s sacrifice on our behalf.<br>
As our High Priest in heaven, Christ also pleads with humanity. He works to help the indifferent take a second look at grace, to help despairing sinners grasp hope in the gospel, and to help believers find more riches in the Word of God and more power in prayer. Jesus is molding our lives in harmony with God’s commandments and helping us develop characters that will stand the test of time.<br>
God laid down His life for every person who has ever lived in this world. And now, as High Priest or Mediator, “He always lives” to lead people to accept His death for their sins. Although He reconciled the whole fallen world to Himself on the cross, He still can’t save us unless we accept His grace. People will not be lost because they are sinners, but because they refuse to accept the pardon Jesus offers.<br>
Sin destroyed the intimate relationship Adam and Eve once enjoyed with God. But Jesus, as the Lamb of God, died to free all humanity from sin and restore this lost friendship. Have you discovered Him as your High Priest, the One who ever lives to keep that relationship close and vibrant?<br>
Christ’s sacrificial death is utterly unique. Christ’s heavenly ministry is incomparable. Only Christ brings God close beside us. Only Christ makes it possible for the divine Spirit to actually dwell in our hearts. He emptied Himself in order to make us full. He deserves a similar commitment from us. Let’s accept Him fully as the Savior and Master of our lives.<br>

There were no fingerprints. No weapon was ever discovered. No one saw the murderer enter the office of the doctor. No one even heard the shots ring out. But the doctor was found sprawled behind his desk. Five bullets had pierced his shirt.<br>
It seemed the perfect crime. The police at first could find no clues. But then they noticed a tiny wire attached to a pencil holder on the doctor’s desk. The wire led to a tape recorder in a desk drawer. The pencil holder, they realized, actually concealed a microphone that the doctor used to record his conversations with the patients he was counseling.<br>
The investigators quickly rewound the tape and, to their amazement, began to listen to a replay of the actual crime. A man named Anthony had entered the office and began a heated argument with the doctor. Shots rang out. The tape ended with the terrible moans of the doctor, dying on the carpet.<br>
Every awful detail had been recorded. The murderer thought his crime would forever remain a secret. He’d been so careful to leave no clues. But the tape told the whole story.<br>
In this guide we’re going to learn about God’s final judgment when human beings are “judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books” (Revelation 20:12). For those who have not accepted Christ as their Savior, it will be bad news. But the judnment is wonderfully good news for those who’ve found security in Christ.<br>

Who will judge the world?<br>
“The Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.”-John 5:22. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
How did the cross prepare Christ to become our Judge?<br>
“God presented him [Jesus] as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice,… so as to be JUST AND THE ONE WHO JUSTIFIES those who have faith in Jesus.”-Romans 3:25, 26.<br>
Christ’s death as our substitute enables Him to act as both a just Judge and a gracious Justifier who can forgive the repentant sinner. When the watching universe asks the question, “How can an impartial judge declare a guilty person not guilty?” Christ can answer by pointing to the scars in His hands. He has received the just penalty for our sins in His own body.<br>
The books of heaven preserve a record of every individual life, and these records are utilized in the judgment (Revelation 20:12). That’s the bad news for those who imagine their secret sins and crimes will never return to haunt them. But there is wonderfully good news for all who’ve sincerely accepted Christ as their Advocate in heaven: “The blood of Jesus… purifies us from all sin” (1 John 1:7).<br>
What does Jesus offer in exchange for our life of sin?<br>
“God made him [Christ] who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”-2 Corinthians 5:21.<br>
Our life of sin is exchanged for Christ’s perfect life of righteousness. Because of Jesus’ sinless life and death, God can forgive us and treat us as if we’d never sinned.<br>
What qualifies Jesus to be our Advocate and Judge?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
At His baptism, Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit:<br>
“As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lightning on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’”-Matthew 3:16, 17.<br>
Following Christ’s anointing by the Holy Spirit at His baptism, the disciples announced:<br>
“We have found the Messiah’ [the Christ].”-John 1:41.<br>
The disciples knew that the Hebrew word “Messiah” and the Greek word “Christ” both mean “the anointed One.”<br>
Luke, a disciple of Jesus, recorded the date of Jesus’ anointing as the Messiah as the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar (Luke 3:1). To us that would be the year A.D. 27.<br>
 More than 500 years before Jesus came the prophet Daniel predicted that Jesus would be anointed as the Messiah in A.D.27:<br>
“From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One,…will be seven ‘sevens’ [weeks, Hebrew] and sixty-two ‘sevens’ [weeks].-Daniel 9:25.<br>
Seven weeks and sixty-two weeks total sixty-nine weeks or 483 days (7 X 69 = 483 days). In symbolic Bible prophecy each day equals one year (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34), so the 483 days equal 483 years. Daniel predicted that command would go forth to restore and rebuild Jerusalem and exactly 483 years after this command, the Messiah would appear.<br>
Did Jesus appear as the Messiah at the appointed time? Artaxerxes issued the decree to rebuild Jerusalem in 457 B.C. (Ezra 7:7-26). The 483 years, then, ended in A.D.27 (457 B.C. + A.D.27 = 484.) The decree went forth during the year 457 and Christ was anointed during A.D.27, making them both partial years, so the correct time would be 483 years.)<br>
At the very time appointed, in A.D.27, Jesus appeared with message: “The time has come” (Mark 1:15). The accurate fulfillment of this Bible prophecy is impressive confirmation that Jesus of Nazareth is indeed the Messiah, God in human flesh.<br>
How long was Jesus to confirm the promise?<br>
“He will confirm a covenant [a promise] with many for one ‘seven’ [week, Hebrew].”-Daniel 9:27, first part.<br>
When we apply the year-day principle, this “week” would be seven years. So, for seven years-from A.D.27 to A.D.34-Jesus would “confirm a covenant” or promise, He had made to Adam and Eve shortly after they sinned. God made a covenant, a promise, that He would save the human race from sin through the death of Someone He would send to die for our sins (Genesis 3:15).<br>
What was to happen in the middle of this seventieth week?<br>
“In the middle of the ‘seven’ [week, Hebrew] he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.”-Daniel 9:27, last part.<br>
Jesus was crucified in A.D.31, in “the middle of the week.” At the moment of Christ’s death, God tore “the curtain of the temple… in two from top to bottom” (Matthew 27:51). The sacrificial offering about to be slain (a symbol of Jesus “the Lamb of God”) escaped from the priest’s hands. This was a sign that God no longer wanted humanity to offer animal sacrifices. Fulfilling prophecy down to the letter, Jesus “put an end to” any need for further sacrifices to be offered. Since Christ’s death, people gain access to God not through animal sacrifices and human priests, but through the Messiah, the Lamb of God and our High Priest.<br>

According to Daniel’s prophecy, why did Jesus die?<br>
“The Anointed One will be cut off but not for himself.”-Daniel 9:26, margin.<br>
At his death on the cross, Jesus was “cut off.” He died, “but nor for himself.” Not to pay a penalty for His own sin, but to pay the penalty for sins of the entire world.<br>
How can we know that God has forgiven all our sins?<br>
“Righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe….ALL HAVE SINNED…, and are JUSTIFIED freely BY HIS GRACE through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus…THROUGH FAITH IN HIS BLOOD.”-Romans 3:22-25.<br>
The key points in these verses are: We “all have sinned,” but because of God’s “grace,” all “are justified” who have “faith” in the cleansing power of Christ’s “blood.” When we are justified, God declares us not guilty, taking away the guilt of our past sins. And God declares us righteousness; “righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ.”<br>
All of us who are worn out by the struggle to be good enough, to measure up on our own, can find real rest in Christ’s gracious acceptance. He promises, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). All of us who are burdened by scars from the past and by an aching sense of inadequacy and shame, can find peace and wholeness in Christ.<br>

In the eighth chapter of Daniel an angel showed the prophet a great panorama of the future. Daniel saw (1) a ram, (2) a he-goat, and (3) out of one of the horns of the he-goat, “another horn which started small and grew in power” (Daniel 9:8, 9); symbols representing (1) Medo-Persia, (2) Greece, (3) Rome (Daniel 8:1-12, 20-26).<br>
What is the fourth part of the prophecy?<br>
“’How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled-the vision concerning the daily sacrifice…?’ He said to me, ‘It will take 2,300 evening and mornings [or days, Hebrew]; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated [cleansed].’”-Daniel 8:13, 14.<br>
Daniel fainted before the angel could explain the 2,300-day part of he prophecy, and the eighth chapter closes with no interpretation of it. But later the angel reappeared and stated:<br>
“Understand the vision: seventy ‘seven’ [weeks, Hebrew] are decreed [cut off, Hebrew] for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness.”-Daniel 9:22-24.<br>
The 2,300 days are, of course, 2,300 years, each day standing for a year (Ezekiel 4:6). Seventy weeks, or 490 years, constituted the first section of the longer period of 2,300 years. Both time periods started in 457 B.C. when Persia used the decree “to restore and rebuild Jerusalem.” Subtracting 490 years from the 2,300 years, leaves 1,810. Adding 1,810 years to A.D.34, when the 490 years ended, brings us to A.D. 1844.<br>

The angel told Daniel that in 1844, at the end of the 2,300 years “the sanctuary will be cleansed” (Daniel 8:14, KJV). But what does that mean? Since A.D.70 when the Romans destroyed the temple at Jerusalem, God’s people have had no temple on earth. So the sanctuary to be cleansed, beginning in 1844, has to be the heavenly sanctuary of which the earthly temple was a replica.<br>
Now, what does the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary mean? Ancient Israel called the day for cleansing the earthly sanctuary Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It was really a day of judgment.<br>
As we discovered in Guide 12, Christ’s activity for us in the sanctuary has two phases: (1) The daily sacrifices focus on the priest’s ministry in the first room of the sanctuary, the Holy Place. (2) The yearly sacrifice concentrates on the High Priest’s ministry in the second room, the Most Holy Place (Leviticus 16).<br>
In the earthly sanctuary, as people confessed their sins day by day, the blood of slaughtered animals was sprinkled on the corner of the altar, then transferred to the Holy Place (Leviticus 4 and 6). Thus, in symbol, day after day the confessed sins were brought into the sanctuary and laid up there.<br>
Then each year, on the Day of Atonement, the sanctuary was cleansed from all sins confessed during the past year (Leviticus 16). To effect this cleansing, the High Priest made a special sacrifice of a consecrated goat. He then carried its blood into the<br>
                                                      <br>
At the end of the 2,300 years, “the sanctuary will be cleansed.”<br>
                                                      <br>
(Please refer to Guide 13 p.4 for more details.) <br>
                                                      <br>
Most Holy Place and sprinkled this cleansing blood before the atonement cover to show that the blood of Jesus, the coming Redeemer, would pay the penalty for sin. The High Priest then symbolically removed the confessed sins from the sanctuary and placed them on the head of another goat, which was led out into the wilderness to die (Leviticus 16:20-22).<br>
This ceremony on the yearly Day of Atonement cleansed the sanctuary from sin. The people regarded it as a day of judgment because those who refused to confess their sins were considered unrighteous and were “cut off from [God’s] people” (23:29).<br>
What the High Priest did symbolically once a year, Jesus does once for all time as our High Priest (Hebrews 9:6-12). In the great judgment day He removes from the sanctuary the confessed sins of all who have accepted Him as their Savior. If we have confessed our sins, He will forever blot out the record of our sins at that time (Acts 3:19). This ministry is the work of judgment that Jesus began in 1844.<br>
In 1844 when the hour of God’s judgment began in heaven, a judgment hour message began to be preached throughout the world (Revelation 14:6-7). A future DISCOVER guide will deal with this message.<br>

Since 1844 Christ, as Judge, has been investigating the record of each person who has ever lived to confirm who will be among the saved when Jesus comes. As our Judge, Jesus “wipe out” all of the sins of the righteous from their life record in heaven (Acts 3:19).<br>
When your name comes up in judgment, it will be easy to face your life record-IF you’ve accepted Christ as your Substitute. And when the judgment of the righteous is finished, Jesus returns to earth to reward them (Revelation 22:12, 14).<br>
Are you ready for Jesus to come? Or is there something you’ve been hiding from Him? Do you have an open and honest relationship with the One who promises:<br>
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.”-1 John 1:9.<br>
Confession simply means agreeing to face our sins, accept God’s forgiveness, and acknowledge our need of His power and grace.<br>
While visiting a prison in Potsdam, King Frederick William I listened to a number of pleas for pardon. All the inmates swore that prejudiced judges, perjured witnesses, or unscrupulous lawyers were responsible for their imprisonment. From cell to cell the same story of wronged innocence continued. <br>
But at one cell the inmate had nothing to say. Surprised, Frederick joked, “I suppose you are innocent too.”<br>
“No your majesty,” the man answered, “l am guilty and richly deserve all that I get.”<br>
The king turned to the guard and called out loudly, “Come and release this rascal quickly, before he corrupts this fine lot of innocent people.”<br>
How do we prepare for the judgment? How do we get ready for Christ to come? Simply by an honest confession of the truth: I richly deserve the penalty of death for my sins, but Another has taken my place and given me a wonderful pardon.<br>
Make a commitment right now that whatever happens, you’ll keep your relationship with Christ eye-to-eye honest and heart-to-heart sincere.<br>

Anatoli Levitin, a Russian writer and historian, spent years in the Siberian Gulag where petitions to God must have seemed frozen to the ground. But he came back quite spiritually fit. “The greatest miracle of all is prayer,” he wrote. “I have only to turn mentally to God and at once I feel a force that pours into me from somewhere, into my soul, my whole being. What is it? Where would I, an insignificant old man and tired of life, get this strength which renews and saves me, elevating me above the earth? It comes from outside me- and there is no force in the world which could ever resist it.”<br>
In this guide we will see how prayer can help us build a stronger relationship with God and a robust Christian life.<br>

How can we be sure God hears us when we pray?<br>
“Then you will call upon me and come and PRAY TO ME, and I WILL LISTEN TO YOU. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.”-Jeremiah 29:12, 13. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New the International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
What assurance did Jesus give that He will hear and answer our prayers?<br>
“So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.”-Luke 11:9.<br>
Prayer is a two-way conversation. That’s what Jesus promises:<br>
“Here I am! I stand at door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.”-Revelation 3:20.<br>
How is it possible to sit down and have a nice evening of dinner conversation with Christ? First, by telling Him everything that’s on our hearts in prayer. Second, by listening carefully. As we meditate in prayer, God can speak to us directly. And as we read the Word of God devotionally, God will speak to us through its pages. <br>
Prayer can become a way of life for the Christian.<br>
“PRAY CONTINUALLY; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”-1 Thessalonians 5:16-18.<br>
How can we “pray continually”? Do we have to stay on our knees all the time or constantly repeat phrases of adoration or petition? Of course not. But we are to live so closely in touch with Jesus that we feel free to speak to Him anytime, anywhere.<br>
“In the crowds of the street, in the midst of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God and plead for divine guidance…. We should have the door of the heart open continually and our invitation going up that Jesus may come and abide as a heavenly guest in the soul.”-Step to Christ, p.99.<br>
One of the best ways to develop this kind of intimate relationship is to learn to meditate as we pray.<br>
“May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.”-Psalms 104:34.<br>
Don’t just rush through a list of requests when you pray. Wait. Listen. A little prayerful reflection can greatly enrich your relationship with God.<br>
“Come near to God and he will come near to you.”-James 4:8.<br>
The closer we come to Jesus, the more we’re able to experience His presence. So keep within speaking distance of Jesus, and don’t worry about saying the right words. Just talk honestly and openly. Talk about everything. He’s gone through the agony of death itself in order to become your Intimate Friend.<br>

When we engage in prayer, we may wish to follow the outline of the Lord’s Prayer, the model prayer Jesus taught His disciples in response to their request: “Teach us to pray.”<br>
“Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one, for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.”-Matthew 6:9-13, margin.<br>
According to the pattern Jesus provided in His prayer, we are to come to God as our heavenly Father. Ask that His will take charge in our hearts just as His will prevails in all of heaven. We seek Him for our physical needs, forgiveness, and for a forgiving attitude. Remember that our ability to resist sin comes from God. Christ’s prayer concludes with expressions of praise.<br>
On another occasion Jesus instructed His disciples to pray to the Father “in my name” (John 16:23)-that is, to pray in harmony with Jesus’ principles. That’s why Christians usually close their prayers with the words: “In Jesus’ name, Amen.” Amen is a Hebrew word that means “Let it be so.”<br>
Although the Lord’s Prayer gives guidelines on what to pray for and how to formulate a prayer, our communication with God works best as a spontaneous composition of the heart.<br>
We can pray about everything. God invites us to pray about forgiveness for our sins (1 John 1:9), increased faith (Mark 9:24), the necessities of life (Matthew 6:11), healing from suffering and disease (James 5:15), and the outpouring of the Spirit (Zechariah 10:1). Jesus assures us that we can take all our needs and cares to Him; nothing is too small to pray about.<br>
“Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.”-1 Peter 5:7.<br>
Our Savior is interested in every detail of our lives. His heart warms when our hearts reach out to Him in love and faith.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Most of us have things we hesitate sharing even with our closest friends. So God invites us to unburden ourselves in private prayer: one-on-one with Him. It’s not that He needs any information. The Almighty knows our secret fears, hidden motives, and buried resentments better than we do ourselves. But we need to open up our hearts to the One who knows us intimately and loves us infinitely. Healing can begin when Jesus can touch our wounds.<br>
When we pray, Jesus, our High Priest, is near to help us:<br>
“We have one who has been TEMPTED IN EVERY WAY, JUST AS WE ARE-yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”-Hebrews 4:15, 16.<br>
Do you feel anxious, stressed-out, guilty? Lay it out before the Lord. He can then supply our every need.<br>
Should we have a special place for private prayer?<br>
“When we pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who… will reward you.”-Matthew 6:6<br>
In addition to praying when walking in the street, working on the Job, or enjoying a social gathering, every Christian should have a time set aside each day for personal prayer and Bible study. Make your daily appointment with God at the time when you feel most alert and can concentrate the best.<br>

Joining with others in prayer creates a special bond and invites God’s power in a special way.<br>
“For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.”-Matthew 18:20.<br>
One of the greatest things we can do as a family is to develop a prayer life together. Show your children that we can take our needs to Him directly. They’ll get excited about God as they see Him respond to prayer in the practical details of life. Make family worship a happy, relaxed time of sharing.<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
When Moses prayed, the Red Sea parted. When Elijah prayed, fire came down from heaven. When Daniel prayed, an angel shut the mouths of ravenous lions. The Bible presents us with many exciting accounts of answered prayer. And it recommends prayer as the way to tap into the mighty power of God. Jesus promises:<br>
“You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.”-John 14:14.<br>
Yet some prayers seem to go unheeded. Why? Here are seven principles that will help you pray more effectively:<br>
(1)Keep close to Christ.<br>
“IF YOU REMAIN IN ME and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you.”-John 15:7.<br>
When we make our relationship with God a priority and keep in touch with Him, we’ll be listening and looking for answers to our prayers that, otherwise, might go undetected.<br>
(2)Keep trusting God.<br>
“If you BELIEVE, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”-Matthew 21:22.<br>
To believe, or have faith, means that we’re really looking to our heavenly Father to supply our need. If you’re troubled by a lack of faith remember that our Savior performed a miracle for the man who pled in desperation:<br>
“I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!”-Mark 9:24.<br>
Just concentrate on exercising the faith you DO have; don’t worry about the faith you DON’T have.<br>
(3)Surrender calmly to God’s will.<br>
“This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything ACCORDING TO HIS WILL, he hears us.”-1 John 5:14.<br>
Remember that God wants to teach us, as well as give us things, through prayer. So sometimes He says. “No”; sometimes He turns us in another direction. Prayer is a means of getting more and more in touch with God’s will. We need to be sensitive to God’s responses and learn from them. Keeping track of specific requests and what happens as a result is a great help.<br>
The Holy Spirit will help you zero in on the right mark: “The Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God’s will” (Romans 8:27). Remember that our will would always coincide with God’s will if we could see as He does.<br>
(4)Wait patiently on God.<br>
“I WAITED PATIENTLY for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.”-Psalm 40:1.<br>
The main point here is to keep your focus on God, keep your focus on His solution. And don’t ask God for support one minute and then try to drown your troubles in pleasure-seeking the next. Wait patiently on the Lord; we badly need that discipline.<br>
(5)Don’t hang on to any sin.<br>
“If I had CHERISHED SIN IN MY HEART, the Lord would not have listened.”-Psalm 66:18.<br>
Known sin short-circuits the power of God in our lives; it separates us from God (Isaiah 59:1-2). You can’t hang onto sin with one hand and reach out for divine help with the other. Sincere confession and repentance solves the problem.<br>
If we’re not willing to allow God to free us from evil thoughts, words, and deeds, our prayers won’t be effective.<br>
“When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.”-James 4:3.<br>
God isn’t going to answer “yes” to selfish prayers.<br>
Keep your ears open to God’s law, His will, and He will keep His ears open to your petitions.<br>
“If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, even his prayers are detestable.”-Proverbs 28:9.<br>
(6)Feel the need of God.<br>
God responds to those who ask for His presence and power in their lives.<br>
“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.”-Matthew 5:6.<br>
(7)Persist in Prayer.<br>
Jesus illustrated the need to persist in our petitions by telling the story of a very persistent widow who kept coming to a judge with her request. At last the judge said in exasperation, “Because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice,” then Jesus concluded: “Will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?” (Luke 18:5-7).<br>
Discuss all your needs, hopes, and dreams with God. Ask for particular blessings, for help in time of need. Keep seeking, and keep listening, until you learn something from God’s response.<br>

The Psalmist rejoiced that through the ministry of the angel of the Lord his prayers were answered:<br>
“I sought the LORD, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears…The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them.”-Psalm 34:4-7.<br>
When we pray, God sends angels to answer our prayers (Hebrews 1:14). Each Christian has an accompanying guardian angel:<br>
“See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that THEIR ANGELS in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.”-Matthew 18:10.<br>
Because of our prayers:<br>
“The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace pf God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”-Philippians 4:5-7.<br>

The Bible describes a distinct Christian lifestyle. According to Ephesians 4:22-24, the Christian is to “put off” the old lifestyle that resulted from “deceitful desires,” and “put on” the new lifestyle that is “created to be like God.” In this scripture and in Guide 6 we discovered that at the new birth we are “re-created” to be a different kind of person in Christ.<br>
This guide and the six guides which follow, showcase the Christian lifestyle; they reveal the secrets of a happy Christian life. They will help you build a stronger relationship with Christ, that will result in a distinct Christian lifestyle. So fix your eyes on Jesus today and you can be part of that final victory celebration when Christ’s peace reigns unchallenged.<br>

In 1943, Japanese occupation forces ordered hundreds of American and European “enemy nationals” to an internment camp in China’s Shantung Province. They had to endure months of boredom, frustration, overcrowding, and fear. Personalities clashed, tempers flared. Petty squabbles multiplied.<br>
But one man was described by an internee as “without a doubt the person most in demand and most respected and loved in camp”-Eric Liddell, a missionary Scotland.<br>
A Russian prostitute in camp would later recall that Liddell was the only man who’d ever done anything for her without wanting to be repaid in kind. When she first came into camp, alone and snubbed, he put up some shelves for her.<br>
Another internee recalled, “He had a gentle, humorous way of soothing ruffled tempers.”<br>
At one angry meeting of the internees, everybody was demanding that someone else do something about the restless teenagers who were getting into trouble. Liddell came up with a solution. He organized sports, crafts, and classes for the kids, and began spending his evenings with them.<br>
Liddell had won fame and glory at the 1924 Olympics, taking a gold medal in the 400 meters race. But in that cramped compound he showed himself a winner in the Christian race as well, earning the admiration of the most worldly internees.<br>
What made him so special? You could have discovered his secret at 6 a.m. each morning. That’s when he tiptoed quietly past sleeping companions, settled down at a table, and lit a small lamp to illuminate this notebook and Bible. Eric Liddell sought grace and strength each day in the riches of God’s Word.<br>

The Bible was written as a guidebook for the Christian. It is full of stories of real people like us who have experienced the same challenges we face every day. Getting to know these Bible characters-their joys and sorrows, their problems and opportunities-helps us mature as Christians.<br>
The psalmist David pictures our daily dependence on the Word of God by comparing it to a flashlight [torchlight]:<br>
“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.”-Psalms 119:105. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of Bible [NIV].)<br>
The illumination we get each day from the Bible makes clear the qualities we need in our lives and the principles of spiritual growth. Above all, the Bible presents us with Jesus, the Light of the World. Life only makes sense when Jesus is shining on it.<br>

Christ wants the Bible to be as real to you as a personal letter from a close friend.<br>
“I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.”-John 15:15.<br>
Jesus wants the very best for us. His Word brings us into God’s inner circle: those He confides in and personally instructs.<br>
“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.”-John 16:33.<br>
In order to experience this peace, this secure relationship with Christ, we need to read the letters He sends us. That’s what the Bible is: correspondence from heaven. Don’t leave those letters unopened. The transforming message you need is in the Word.<br>
Here is one typical testimony about the Bible’s impact: “I needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was supplied, the hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me the revelation of Christ. I believe in Jesus because He is to me a divine Savior. I believe the Bible because I have found it to be the voice of God to my soul.”-The Ministry of Healing, p.461.<br>

A brief look at the Ten Commandments will help us understand why they and the Bible are an indispensable basis for right living.<br>
The Commandments naturally fall into two divisions, the first four define our relationship to God, and the last six define our relationship to other people. They are found in Exodus 20:3-17.<br>
The first two commandments outline our relationship to God and to His worship.<br>
I.“You shall have no other gods before me.”<br>
II.“You shall not make for yourself an idol… You shall not bow down to them or worship them….”<br>
The 3rd and 4th commandments sketch our relationship to God’s name and to His holy day.<br>
III.“You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God…”<br>
IV.“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all you work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God….”<br>
Commandments 5 and 7 safeguard family bonds.<br>
V.“Honor your father and your mother....”<br>
VII.“You shall not commit adultery.”<br>
Commandments 6,8,9, and 10 protect us in social relationships.<br>
VI. “You shall not murder.”<br>
VIII.“You shall not steal.”<br>
IX.“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.”<br>
X.“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”<br>
The Ten Commandments define our relationship both to God and to other people. They are the guidepost of a Christian lifestyle.<br>

One day as Jesus was teaching, an enthusiastic young man buried up to Him and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?” (Matthew 19:16). Christ could see that he was wrestling with a money problem and advised him to get rid of his possessions and “obey the commandments” (verse 17).<br>
The young man tried to sidestep Christ’s diagnosis of his problem by asking which commandments He was talking about. Jesus listed several of the Ten Commandments (Verse 18, 19).<br>
Finally, the “rich young ruler” turned and walked away sadly (verse 20-22). He could give mental assent to the Ten Commandments, but he couldn’t obey the spirit of the law by abandoning his selfish way of life.<br>
The Ten Commandments show us the boundaries within which healthy relationships, with God and each other, can grow. Jesus pointed to obedience as the way to real joy:<br>
“If you OBEY MY COMMANDS, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father’s commands and remain in his love. I HAVE TOLD YOU THIS SO that my joy may be in you and THAT YOUR JOY MAY BE COMPLETE.”-John 15:10, 11.<br>

The book of Ecclesiastes is a report of Solomon’s search for happiness. He records his quest for happiness in the riches of the world: magnificent houses, productive vineyards, beautiful gardens, and orchards of luscious fruit. He multiplied servants. He found himself surrounded with every material thing a person could desire. But happiness eluded him, and he wrote:<br>
“When I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind.”-Ecclesiastes 2:11.<br>
Solomon then turned to searching out the pleasure of this world in hope of finding the happiness. He was taken in by wine, women, and song. His conclusion:<br>
“Meaningless! Meaningless!...Everything is meaningless!”-Ecclesiastes 12:8.<br>
Solomon has once tasted and seen that the Lord is good. As he compared his early life of obedience to God with his reckless chase for happiness in the things of sin, his verdict: <br>
“Here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.”-Ecclesiastes 12:13.<br>
Solomon felt he could find a shortcut to happiness in a wild life. Toward the close of his life, he was man enough to admit his error. To save others from the same error, he wrote,<br>
“He that keepeth the law, happy is he.”-Proverbs 29:18, KJV.<br>

In the New Testament, James testified:<br>
“For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker. Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.”-James 2:10-12.<br>
Charles Spurgeon, the great Baptist preacher of the past century, declared: “The law of God is divine law-holy, heavenly, perfect…. There is not a command too many; there is not one too few, but it is so incomparable that its perfection is proof of its divinity.”<br>
John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist church, wrote this about the enduring nature of the law: “The moral law contained in Ten Commandments…. He [Christ] did not take away…. Every part of this law must remain in force upon all mankind and in all ages.”-Sermons, vol.1, pp.221, 222.<br>
Billy Graham, the world’s most respected evangelical evangelist, regards the Ten Commandments so highly that he has written an entire book about their importance to the Christian.<br>

The Bible and the Ten Commandments are an unchangeable, indispensable, perfect guide to happy living. Yet hearts are still in conflict. One woman expressed it like this: “I believe the Ten Commandments are binding, I am certain that keeping them leads to happiness. I have tried my very best to keep them, but I just can’t do it. I’m beginning to believe that no one else can.”<br>
The tendency of the natural person is to try to live a life of obedience to God’s commands. But in answer to such trying, over and over again from within the blackened heart of a person comes the frustrated response, “I can’t obey!” Why? Because: <br>
“The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.”-Romans 8:7.<br>
What is the purpose of the Ten Commandment law?<br>
“Through the law we become conscious of sin.”-Romans 3:20.<br>
The function of the law is to lead us to utter realization that we are hopelessly lost sinners in need of a Savior.<br>
“The law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.”-Galatians 3:24.<br>
Jesus is the answer! Once we are at Jesus’ feet in absolute helplessness, by faith we can receive forgiveness for our sins and power from Him to obey His commandments.<br>
                                                      <br>
1.LOVING OBEDIENCE TO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS<br>
Jesus tells us that obedience is the result of love:<br>
“If you love me, you will obey what I command.”-John 14:15.<br>
If we love God, we will obey the first four commandments which define our relationship to God; and if we love people, we will obey the last six which define our relationship with others.<br>
The person who tramples on the Ten Commandments sins:<br>
“Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.”-1 John 3:4.<br>
But thank God, we have a Savior who came to this world and died, was resurrected, and now lives for one purpose:<br>
“But you know that He appeared SO THAT HE MIGHT TAKE AWAY OUR SINS.”-Verse 5.<br>
Our Savior forgives and removes our sinfulness (1 John 1:9). He then promises to give us His love to love with-the great antidote to a life of selfishness and sin:<br>
“GOD HAS POURED OUT HIS LOVE IN OUR HEARTS by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.”-Romans 5:5.<br>
We have no innate ability to keep God’s law. God’s love “poured out… in our hearts” is our only hope.<br>
                                                      <br>
2.GOD’S GRACE AND OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW<br>
Salvation is a gift. We cannot earn it. We can only accept it by faith. We can receive justification (right standing with God) as a gift, solely through faith because of God’s grace.<br>
“For it is BY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED, through FAITH-and this not from yourselves, it is THE GIFT OF GOD-not by works, so that no one can boast.”-Ephesians 2:8.<br>
We cannot keep the commandments by our own works-by trying. We cannot keep the commandments to be saved. But when we come to Jesus in faith and submission and are saved, his love fills our hearts. As a result of this divine grace and acceptance, we desire to follow Him and obey Him through the power of His love in our hearts (Romans 5:5).<br>
Paul stresses the futility of human effort and indicates that we are not under the law as a way of salvation, but “under grace.”<br>
“Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!”-Romans 6:15.<br>
Why? Because a heart motivated by love produces a life of loving obedience! (Romans 13:10). To love Christ is to obey Him:<br>
“Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me.”-John 14:21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Eric Liddell demonstrated that, even in the worst of circumstances, the believer who is plugged into God’s power can live a contented, obedient life. Liddell demonstrated a winsome grace in a time of stress and fear. His love relationship with Christ energized him with the Holy Spirit, and enabled him to meet “the righteous requirements of the law” (Romans 8:1-4). A love relationship with the crucified and risen Savior can produce that <br>
Have you discovered this secret for yourself? Jesus’ love for you caused Him to give His life for your sin. He offers to empower all your relationships with His love and to “equip you with everything good for doing His will” (Hebrews 13:21). What is your response?<br>

Just a few years ago some were predicting we would soon have more leisure time than we’d know what to do with. There were good reasons for those confident predictions. In the cities of the world computers were crunching through month-long tasks in fractions of a second. And robots had begun to handle the grueling jobs of heavy industry.<br>
But after the computers have been whirring and the automation automating, we’re more out of breath than ever. People are running out of times these days. Above all, families are running out of time. Husbands and wives find it hard to schedule “quality time” with the kids, much less with each other.<br>
One study in a small community showed that the average time per day that fathers spent alone with their very young sons was-37 seconds! Families are out of time and out of touch.<br>
How can we slow down enough to get in touch again?<br>

Jesus understands the problems of families under stress and He wants us to understand that spiritual rest is part of the quality life:<br>
“COME TO ME, all you who are weary and burdened, and I WILL GIVE YOU REST…. LEARN FROM ME, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find REST FOR YOUR SOULS.”-Matthew 11:28, 29. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
The Bible suggests we experience this kind of rest into two ways: coming to Christ on both a daily and a weekly basis.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Crowds constantly clamored for Jesus’ attention. And yet Christ communicated a peaceful, tranquil spirit to everyone around Him. How? He invested time each day communing with His heavenly Father. He depended on His Father continually for resources to meet life’s challenges (John 6:57).<br>
If we are to live the serene, steady life that He did, we must continually depend on Jesus-let His Word and Spirit fill us and shape us. The best way to counter the forces burning us out as individuals and tearing us apart as families is to invest quality time with Christ. He tells us:<br>
“REMAIN IN ME, and I will remain in you…. APART FROM ME YOU CAN DO NOTHING.”-John 15:4, 5.<br>
One of the greatest needs of our time is for people to tap the spiritual resources available through forming a day-by-day relationship with Jesus. One very important point that needs to be emphasized about our relationship with Christ is His finished work on the cross. True rest, real security, can only exist because of the great accomplishment Jesus referred to when He cried out as He was dying: “It is finished” (John 19:30). In other words, His work of redeeming us was completed.<br>
“But now he [Christ] has appeared ONCE FOR ALL… TO DO AWAY WITH SIN by the sacrifice of himself.”-Hebrews 9:26.<br>
When Jesus died, He did “away with sin.” That’s why it’s said that the believer who has confessed his or her sins can “rest” in the finished work of Christ. We’re accepted. <br>
Guilt lies behind much of the frantic pace of our lives today. But Jesus solved the guilt problem once and for all at the cross. Jesus’ cry, “It is finished,” sealed His promise of “I will give you rest” as an established fact. Christ completed the work of redeeming us at Calvary (Titus 2:14), then He rested in the tomb over the Sabbath, and rose from the grave Sunday morning as the Victor over sin and death. The Christian can have no greater assurance than to rest in the finished work of Christ.<br>
“Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart IN FULL ASSURANCE OF FAITH,… Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for HE WHO PROMISED IS FAITHFUL.”-Hebrews 10:22, 23.<br>
Because He “who promised is faithful,” we can enter into the salvation-rest Jesus has promised. The stability, peace, and rest we experience in Jesus every day is a result not of anything we do, but of what He did at the cross.<br>
We can rest in Christ because our salvation is assured. That assurance motivates us to spend time with Christ each day, feeding on His Word and breathing in the atmosphere of heaven through prayer. A rendezvous with Jesus helps us turn a stressed-out lifestyle into a peaceful and purposeful life.<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
After Christ created the world in six days (Colossians 1:16-17), He provided Sabbath-rest. It is a weekly opportunity for us to cultivate our connection with Him.<br>
“God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. By the seventh day God had finished the work he has been doing; so on the seventh he RESTED from all his work. And God BLESSED the seventh day and MADE IT HOLY, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.”-Genesis 1:31-2:3.<br>
As their Creator, Jesus “rested” on the first Sabbath with Adam and Eve, and He “blessed” the Sabbath day and “made it holy.” God established a seven-day weekly cycle, not for His own benefit, but for Adam and Eve and for us today. Because He cared so much for the people He had made, He planned that every seventh day throughout their lives should be dedicated to seeking His presence. Each Sabbath, as He called it, was to be a day of both physical rest and spiritual refreshment. The entrance of sin into our world only made the need for Sabbath rest more acute.<br>
The same Savior who promised Adam and Eve “rest,” about two thousand years later gave the law to Moses on Mount Sinai (1 Corinthians&nbsp; 10:1-4). Jesus chose to place the Sabbath-rest commandment at the very heart of the Ten Commandments. The fourth commandment reads:<br>
“REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY BY KEEPING IT HOLY. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he RESTED on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD BLESSED the Sabbath day and MADE IT HOLY.”-Exodus 20:8-11.<br>
God established the Sabbath as a day to “remember” the Lord who “made the heavens and the earth.” Sabbath-rest each week links us with the Creator who blessed this day and set it apart.<br>
When Jesus lived on earth, He took advantage of every opportunity to sustain His union with the Father. He benefited from Sabbath-rest by worshipping on Sabbath, as Luke tells us:<br>
“He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and ON THE SABBATH DAY he went into the synagogue, AS WAS HIS CUSTOM.”-Luke 4:16.<br>
If the divine-human Jesus needed to rest in His Father’s presence on the Sabbath day, we human beings certainly need it more. When Jesus swept aside the legal restrictions the Jews had placed on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:1-12), He pointed out that God had made it to benefit people:<br>
“He said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.’”-Mark 2:27, 28.<br>
Jesus highlighted the importance of the Sabbath even in His death. He died on Friday, “the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin” (Luke 23:54). At that moment He declared, “It is finished,” that is, His work of coming to this world and dying as substitute for the human race was complete (John 19:30; 4:34; 5:30). Then to celebrate His finished mission, Jesus rested in the tomb over the Sabbath.<br>
Just as Christ completed His work of creation on the sixth day and then rested on the seventh day, so through dying on the cross He completed His work of redemption on the sixth day, and then rested on the seventh.<br>
On Sunday morning Jesus came out from the tomb, a victorious Savior (Luke 24:1-7). He had already asked His disciples to maintain the Sabbath encounter with Him after His resurrection. Speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem, which took place nearly forty years after His death, He charged them: <br>
“Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.”-Matthew 24:20.<br>
Our Savior wanted His disciples and their converts to continue the practices He had taught them (John 15:15, 16). He wanted them to experience both salvation-rest and Sabbath-rest. They did not disappoint Him. The disciples continued to observe the Sabbath after Christ’s death (see Luke 23:54-56; Acts 13:14; 16:13; 17:2; 18:1-4). <br>
The beloved apostle John kept up his weekly link with Christ on the Sabbath day. In his later years he wrote, “On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit” (Revelation 1:10). According to Jesus, “the Lord’s Day” is the Sabbath, “for the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:8).<br>
On the Sabbath we celebrate the Lord’s two greatest accomplishments on our behalf: creating us and saving us. This Sabbath experience will continue in heaven:<br>
“’As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,’ declares the LORD,…‘from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,’ says the LORD.”-Isaiah 66:22, 23.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
People today are trampling over each other in their frantic life. Individuals are burning out. Families are falling apart under the strain. But God presents the Sabbath as a much better way to live the good life.<br>
Let’s look at some of the specific benefits of Sabbath-rest:<br>
(1) The Sabbath is a memorial of creation, and by keeping it holy, we erect a memorial to our Creator. Its sacred hours offer a wonderful opportunity to get in touch with our roots on God’s created world. When was the last time you or your family took time to really soak in the quiet beauty of a forest path or rocky stream? The Sabbath gives us time to spend with Jesus and catch glimpse of the wonders He has made for us.<br>
(2) On the Sabbath we experience the joy of worship and fellowship with other Christians. There’s a benefit from praising God with others as a group of worshipers. The Sabbath gives us that special time of coming together as a church body to recharge our spiritual batteries.<br>
(3) The Sabbath provides occasions to perform thoughtful acts of kindness. Has a neighbor been sick during the week when you had no time to visit? When a friend needed a sympathetic ear after her husband’s death, did the pressure of daily living deprive her of your loving attention? Jesus advised: “It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:12).<br>
(4) The Sabbath is a day to strengthen family ties. Then Christ commanded, “On [the Sabbath] you shall not do any work” (Exodus 20:10). He couldn’t have given a better prescription to workaholic dads and stressed-out moms. The Sabbath is a giant STOP sign for families. Stop letting the most urgent things crowd out the most important things. The Sabbath is one day when we can replace pressure with prayer, labor with laughter, busy schedules with quiet reflection. Sabbath-rest provides the entire family with time to link up with Christ and tap into His spiritual energy.<br>
(5) The Sabbath is a time when Jesus comes especially near. Every relationship needs quality time, and our relationship with Christ is no exception. Devoting a whole day to Christ each week is a great way to keep our friendship with Him fresh and exciting. The Sabbath gives us extra time for Bible study and prayer, extra time to simply be alone with Christ in a quiet place and listen.<br>
Jesus “blessed the seventh day and made it holy” with the promise of His presence (Genesis 2:3). You can understand why it is important to observe Saturday, the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, because it is the day Christ set apart at creation to communicate with us in a special way.<br>
When Jesus created the Sabbath it almost seems that He had our generation in mind. It’s exactly what we need in our stress-filled environment: a day that is truly a complete break from everything else. A day to worship God, get in touch with creation again, and concentrate on relationships instead of things.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
We can sum up the benefits of linking up with Jesus through a daily and a weekly encounter in one word-rest. The word “Sabbath” comes from a Hebrew word that means rest, so it’s not surprising that the Scripture calls the seventh day “a Sabbath of rest” (Leviticus 23:3).<br>
“[God] has spoken about the seventh day in these words: ‘And on the seventh day God rested from all his work’…. THERE REMAINS, THEN, A SABBATH-REST FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD;…Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest.”-Hebrews 4:4-11.<br>
Experiencing “Sabbath-rest” gives us a weekly foretaste of the joy we will experience in the perfect rest of heaven. This rest isn’t just inactivity, it refers to the sense of security, peace and well-being that lie at the root of the truly abundant life. This kind of spiritual rest can be appreciated only through experience. The testimony of those who have experienced salvation-rest and Sabbath-rest is universal: “If you enter into the rest of Jesus through a daily and weekly connection with Him, you will discover the greatest joy in life.”<br>
Would you like to thank Jesus for His gift of rest? Would you like to thank Him for the promise of salvation-rest each day to meet the challenges of life, and for the promise of Sabbath-rest each week to cement your relationship with Him? If you have never done so, would you like to accept the salvation He offers? Would you like to tell Him you desire to keep His Sabbath each week? Would you like to say, “Yes Lord! I desire to find delight in the day you have established.” Why not make that commitment right now?<br>
[You may be wondering: Who changed the Sabbath from Saturday, the seventh day of the week, to Sunday, the first day of the week? When was the change made? Did God authorize the change? These questions will be answered in Guide 21.]<br>

Larry was enjoying pleasant conversation, Japanese tea, and rice crackers at Mr. Komori’s house when the other guests began taking out their Bibles. They all looked at him expectantly. “Could you please give us our study now?” Mr. Komori asked.<br>
Larry almost choked on his tea. He’d thought this get-together was just to have fun. And now he couldn’t think of a thing to say.<br>
Larry had actually taught many Bible classes at the Christian English language school in Japan where he worked. But they were all well-planned. He could give out information on the Bible with ease. But to just talk about God spontaneously… that was different.<br>
Larry had heard all the Bible stories since childhood. But they meant very little to him on a personal basis. He’d been doing things He knew were wrong in God’s eyes. How could he talk to others about a God he himself didn’t really know?<br>
Now, sitting there on the sofa, surrounded by expectant people, his charade was about to collapse. In that moment of fear, a verse flashed into his mind about the Holy Spirit giving us words to say when we are brought before people to give witness (Luke 12:12). He uttered a desperate prayer for help and latched onto the most familiar story he could think of: the Prodigal Son.<br>
As he described how much God loves even those who wander away from Him, Larry found himself speaking straight from the heart. His words were sinking in. For the first time in his life Larry realized how much God loved him.<br>
That night Larry knelt by his bed and committed his life to a God who’d finally become real. Sharing God’s love had made it much more than just a familiar abstraction. It was now a fact that overwhelmed him.<br>

The disciples had spent three and a half years taking in Christ’s words and actions, and finally His death and resurrection. As Jesus was about to return to heaven, He commissioned the disciples to be His personal representatives:<br>
“YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and YOU WILL BE MY WITNESSES… to the ends of the earth.”-Acts 1:8. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
When Christ’s followers gave their heart unreservedly to Him at Pentecost, the risen Christ transformed their lives through the power of the Spirit. They became witnesses, not only to Christ’s bodily resurrection and ascension, but also to His resurrection power that had changed their lives.<br>
As Christian we too are witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus because we have experienced His renewing power in our own lives.<br>
“But because of his great love for us, GOD, who is rich in mercy, MADE US ALIVE WITH CHRIST even WHEN WE WERE DEAD IN TRANSGRESSIONS-it is by grace you have been saved. AND GOD RAISED US UP WITH CHRIST… IN ORDER THAT… HE MIGHT SHOW THE INCOMPARABLE RICHES OF HIS GRACE, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.”-Ephesians 2:4-7.<br>
We have been made alive with Christ, so we can “show the incomparable riches of His grace.” And He asks us to take the good news of what He can do in a human life to all the world, then promises to go with us as we do so (Matthew 28:19-20).<br>
H.M.S. Richards, the founder of the Voice of Prophecy radio ministry, once testified: “I have seen the change in the hearts of people who have heard the gospel of Christ. I have traveled in lands where the name of God and of Christ was never known until His church took the gospel there. I have seen these people changed from filth to cleanliness, from disease to health, from constant fear of evil spirits to joy in Christian living. I have seen the change in the status of womanhood. I have seen true Christian homes emerge from pagan darkness. In every land that I have visited I have seen lives changed. I know that ‘the gospel of Christ… is the power of God unto salvation’ (Romans 1:16). I know that when the church proclaims the gospel message, changes take place in human hearts and in human homes, and they are visible in the lives of those who respond to its appeal.”<br>
God has given to us weak human beings a special part to play in this exciting work, because sharing is a vital part of our growth. In order for our faith to remain healthy, it must be expressed. As Larry discovered so dramatically, sharing our faith helps us experience it more fully, and caused us to grow.<br>

A young man who’d grown up in an abusive home once observed: “I looked at my parents who by their example gave me a distorted image of a God; I never had the example of someone with skin on who loves me.” People around us desperately need someone who will give them a healthy picture of God. They need someone “with skin on” who will demonstrate godly qualities. Our most powerful sermon is often simply the way we live. Before a person cares how much you know, they must know how much you care. Peter urges us<br>
“LIVE SUCH GOOD LIVES among the pagans [non-Christian] that… THEY MAY SEE YOUR GOOD DEEDS AND GLORIFY GOD…. because CHRIST SUFFERED FOR YOU, LEAVING YOU AN EXAMPLE, THAT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS-1 Peter 2:12, 21.<br>
Since “Christ suffered” for us at Calvary, we have an example of sacrificial love very close at hand. That love, reproduced in us as loving acts to others, can become a powerful force drawing unbelievers into the arms of Christ.<br>

When the Devil ambushed Jesus in the wilderness with his appeals to appetite, pride, and presumption, Jesus fought back successfully by quoting from Scripture (Mathew 4:4, 7, 10). Christ was prepared because He had filled His mind with Bible truths. That’s where the battle is won or lost-in our minds.<br>
“For as [a person] thinketh in his heart, so is he.”-Proverbs 23:7, KJV.<br>
Growing Christians think heavenward. They concentrate on the healthy qualities they are trying to acquire.<br>
“Rejoice in the Lord always,… in everything, BY PRAYER and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will GUARD YOUR HEARTS AND YOUR MINDS in Christ Jesus. Finally, my brothers, whatever is TRUE, whatever is NOBLE, whatever is RIGHT, whatever is PURE, whatever is LOVELY, whatever is ADMIRABLE-if anything is EXCELLENT or PRAISEWORTHY-think about such things…. And the God of peace will be with you.”-Philippians 4:4-9.<br>
What we feed our minds makes all the difference. Garbage in, garbage out. God’s Word in, God’s life out.<br>

As a representative of Christ, the Christian will be modest even about how he or she looks, avoiding all kinds of extremes.<br>
“If any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over… when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. Instead, it should be that of your inner self, THE UNFADING BEAUTY OF A GENTLE AND QUIET SPIRIT, which is of great worth in God’s sight. For this is the way… [those] who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful.”-1 Peter 3:1-5.<br>
Simplicity in dress and adornment has always marked genuine Christ-likeness. Ideally, others should be attracted to us as Christians not by the statement we make about fashion, but by the statement our lives make about Jesus.<br>

The historian Edward Gibbon tells us that when Galerius sacked the camp of the Persians, a shining leather bag filled with pearls fell into the hands of a looting soldier. This man carefully preserved the useful bag, but threw away the precious pearls.<br>
People who cling to the superficial thrills the world can offer up-while discarding Jesus, the Pearl of Great Price- are in even worse shape than the looting soldier. It’s not just a fortune that can slip through our hands, but eternal salvation. So Scripture warns us:<br>
“Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything in the world-the cravings of sinful man [appetite], the lust of his eyes [love of the world], and the boasting of what he has and does [pride]-comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.”-1 John 2:15-17.<br>
Satan works hard to gold-plate the most destructive sins and the worst habits. Advertising for alcoholic drinks shows only young, beautiful, hard-working, intensely happy people. We never see anyone who resembles a pathetic figure stumbling out of the liquor store with a paper sack in their hands. <br>
We have to be careful of associations that compromise our Christian principles (2 Corinthians 6:14). Christ does, of course, want us to keep reaching out to non-Christian friends. Personal relationships are the primary means through which faith is shared. Just make sure that your associates are not dragging you back into the old way of life.<br>
What we take into our lives, even the entertainment we choose, has an impact on our spiritual life. We need to be conscious of what we’re feeding our minds. <br>
“I will set before my eyes no vile thing.”-Psalm 101:3.<br>
If we feed our souls on the best, the worst won’t be able to drag us down to its level. Holding to higher standards in the things we let into our homes and minds won’t narrow our lives. The Christian has more to make him happy than anyone else.<br>
“YOU WILL FILL ME WITH JOY in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.”-Psalm 16:11.<br>

As he was about to baptize a new believer, the late Pastor H.M.S. Richards noticed that the man still had a well-filled billfold in his pocket. Richards asked if he’d forgotten to leave his money in the dressing room. “My pocketbook and I will be baptized together,” the man explained. He had caught the true spirit of Christianity-giving to help others. Christians grow by giving, and that is why “Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive’” (Acts 20:35).<br>
What we give to advance God’s kingdom retains an eternal value.<br>
“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But STORE UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES IN HEAVEN…. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”-Matthew 6:19-21.<br>
As you give, remember: “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it” (Psalm 24:1), including the silver and gold (Haggai 2:8). We ourselves belong to God, because He created us and because He rescued us from our sins by paying the price for our sins with His blood (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Everything we own belongs to God, because He gives us “the ability to produce wealth” (Deuteronomy 8:18).<br>
How much does our crucified and risen Lord invite us to share with Him for giving the gospel to others?<br>
“Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me. But you ask, ‘How do we rob you?’ ‘IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS…. Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,’ says the LORD Almighty, ‘and see if I WILL not THROW OPEN THE FLOODGATES OF HEAVEN and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.’”-Malachi 3:8-10.<br>
Tithe is a “tenth” of our “increase” (Deuteronomy 14:22, KJV; Genesis 28:22). For the farmer or merchant the increase is income after deducting business expenses. For the employee, it is the total wage. The principle of tithing is a moral principle because it involves character. By failing to tithe we “rob” God. The tithe belongs to God and is to be used exclusively for supporting Christ’s ministry (1 Corinthians 9:14), and finishing His work on earth so He can return (Matthew 24:14).<br>
When Jesus came to live among us, He gave approval to tithing in New Testament times (Matthew 23:23).<br>
How much should we give in offerings? Offerings are a matter of individual decision. Each person “should give what he has decided in his heart to give” (2 Corinthians 9:5-7). You can’t outgive God:<br>
“Give and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap.”-Luke 6:38.<br>
H.M.S Richards once related this experience:<br>
“A lifelong gambler attended my meetings in Los Angeles, and I shall never forget the time I talked with him alone in the rear of the auditorium. He took a roll of bills from his pocked, $500, and gave them all to me, saying, ‘This is my first tithe.’<br>
“The man was not well, and he had done nothing but gamble for 30 or 40 years, so I said, ‘How are you going to live?’<br>
He replied, ‘I have only five or six dollars left, but this other belongs to God.’<br>
Then I asked, ‘What will you do?’<br>
“I don’t know,’ he answered, ‘but I know that I must pay my tithe to God, and He will take care of me.’<br>
“And God certainly did. The man’s repentance was sincere. He went all the way in his consecration and was happy in his Christian life. And God provided for him to the day of his death.” God does not promise that all faithful believers will grow rich. But we have the assurance that our Maker will supply life’s necessities.<br>
Christ gave everything for us. Let’s give our hearts completely to Him now. Let’s share Christ with others by the way we live, think, look, act, and give. Why not discover the joy of sharing Christ with others and of growing in His wonderful grace?<br>

Contemporary researchers have taken pains to document a truth which the Bible first established: human beings are an integrated whole. What we often divide into the physical, mental, and spiritual parts of a person are really interrelated and inseparable. In other words, what affects the mind, affects the body. Our spiritual condition has an impact on our physical condition, and vice versa. We are a whole person.<br>
For example, scientific researchers have found in controlled studies that happy, joyful laughter produces measurable changes in a person’s immune system. You can actually help your body fight diseases better by being happy! These studies show how closely the mind and body work together.<br>
Thousand of years ago God’s Word pointed out this vital connection between the mind and the body which has only recently been accepted into medical theory:<br>
“A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.”-Proverbs 17:22. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
According to the apostle John, how closely related are the mind and body to our spiritual well being?<br>
“Dear friend, I pray that you may ENJOY GOOD HEALTH and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.”-3 John 2.<br>
Our Creator wants us to “enjoy good health.” The Word of God can serve as our fountain of health, as well as our fountain of eternal life.<br>
Since physical and mental health and our spiritual well-being go hand-in-hand, Paul makes the following appeal:<br>
“Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.”-1 Corinthians 10:31.<br>
The gospel includes both physical and spiritual restoration. A healthful lifestyle can help us be vibrant Christians.<br>
Here are eight principles to follow if you really want to live a healthier and more productive life:<br>

Pure, fresh air is essential to good health. During the day and while sleeping at night, proper ventilation of our home and workplace insures that our blood will always distribute enough oxygen to every part of the body. Taking deep breaths during a morning walk is a great way to oxygenate your body. <br>
The kind of air we breathe is obviously important. Be careful not to subject yourself to fumes, gases or air-borne bacteria from some hidden source. Smoking pollutes the air and is one of today’s big killers. Scientific research has established a causal relationship between tobacco and lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. The body’s addiction to the nicotine in cigarettes makes smoking one of the hardest habits to break. Smoking will kill 12 million people a year by the year 2020 if the present trend continues.<br>

“The benefits of sunlight are many:<br>
“1. Fifteen to 30 minutes of daily exposure to sunlight in the early morning or late afternoon helps the body synthesize of make its own vitamin D, an essential nutrient/hormone in the skin. Vitamin D helps blood to produce calcium and phosphorous, which build and repair bone mass.<br>
“2. Sunlight acts as a disinfectant and a killer of bacteria.<br>
“3. The sun provides energy by which the plant kingdom can convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates…. Without this process animals and humans would starve to death.<br>
“4. Sunlight also helps a person adjust to night work and relieves depression related to dark days where winter occurs. <br>
“A word of caution: Sunlight can also be harmful. Prolonged exposure can burn skin, increase the risk of skin cancer, speed up the aging process, damage the eyes, and cause cataracts.” [All quotations in this Guide are from Look Up and Live: A Guide to Health, Adult Lessons, First Quarter 1993, (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press Publishing Association).

The body must have rest in order to repair itself. We must have time for recreation and rest to relieve the tensions of work and family responsibilities. Without their required dosage of rest, people often experience anxiety, depression, and irritability. Such emotional stress can lead to illness, which will force us to take the rest our bodies were asking for all along. There’s simply no substitute for a good night’s sleep.<br>
Recharging our spiritual batteries on a daily basis is also important to physical health. A Christian’s daily time of meditation, Bible study, and prayer will heal the body as well as the soul. We also need a regular break from the work cycle, a weekly day of rest, and annual or semi-annual vacations.<br>

Exercise is vital to our health:<br>
“1. Exercise helps to normalize blood pressure.<br>
“2. Exercise allows more blood to reach all pars of the body, keeping the extremities warm. <br>
“3. Exercise releases both physical and emotional tension, helping you to feel better about life. Exercise is usually the best cure for worry and stress.<br>
“4. Exercise provides electrical energy to the brain and nerve cells. It promotes health by stimulating the immune system. When the body is kept in tone by proper exercise, the mind thinks more creatively and efficiently<br>
“5. It can help with your complexion and keep you trim.<br>
“6. Exercise makes you more energetic, thus delaying both physical and emotional fatigue.<br>
“7. It aids in the brain’s production of a chemical that gives you a sense of well-being and increases your tolerance for pain.”<br>
If you have not been exercising, start slowly and increase gradually as you gain endurance. It may be wise to consult your physician before starting. Your goal should be to engage in any type of exercise that is comparable to walking one mile in 15 minutes four or more times a week.<br>

Since water is essential to every cell in the body, we should drink plenty of it.<br>
“1. By weight the body is about 70 percent of water….<br>
“2. The body requires about two and one half quarts of water per day to perform all of its functions. Some of these functions include blood circulation, waste removal, nutrient transport, and digestion….<br>
“3. The average person has between 15 and 40 million brain cells. Each one of those is 70 to 85 percent water. Sufficient water to supply these cells helps keep you mentally alert and helps prevent depression and irritability.<br>
“4. It is not only the water you drink is important. A cool or tepid daily bath or shower improves circulation, thus energizing the body and mind. A shower or bath can also soothe jangled nerves, which can cause illness by weakening the immune system. Bathing also removes impurities from the skin and can reduce fever.”<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
At creation God instructed Adam and Eve to eat a diet of nuts, grains, and fruits (Genesis 1:29). After Adam and Eve sinned, vegetables were added to their diet (Genesis 3:18). After the flood, the Creator added “clean” flesh foods to the diet (Genesis 7:2-3, 9:1-6).<br>
The flesh of animals contains both saturated fat and cholesterol, which increase the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. Today many physicians advise those who eat meat to consume only lean, well-cooked meat and fish and to do so sparingly.<br>
Because people on a vegetarian diet are healthier and live longer, many experts in nutrition and health urge us to consider returning to humanity’s original diet of nuts, grains, and fruits with vegetables added.<br>
If you’d like to start a vegetarian menu, make sure you first understand how to provide a balanced diet without meat. Eat five or six servings a day of a variety of fruits, nuts, grains, legumes, and vegetables. Green and yellow vegetables, along with citrus fruits, are especially important. Use whole grain cereal flour, and use brown rice instead of white. Your intake of starches and complex carbohydrates should consist of six or more servings a day. Replace your intake of animal fats (butter, cream, lard, suet, etc.) with vegetable fats. The above diet is adequate without meat if you use dairy products.<br>
Those who choose to eat meat as a part of their diet, should eat only the meats that the Bible indicates are “clean,” or fit for humans to eat. When God gave people permission to eat meat after the flood (Genesis 7:2-3, Leviticus 11:47), He defined which of the flesh foods were clean, and which were unclean and not fit to eat.<br>
Read in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 list of birds, beasts, and fish God pronounced unfit for food. According to these chapters, clean animals must divide, or split, the hoof and also chew the cud. Clean fish must have both scales and fins. Scavenger birds are forbidden.<br>
Among the unclean animals, swine are especially mentioned and condemned (Deuteronomy 14:8). A high percentage of human bodies autopsied are infected with trichinae. These tiny worms are transmitted to people who eat infected pork. Current scientific research increasingly reveals why God declared some flesh unclean. One reason may be the danger of disease, such as the trichina worm in pork. Another reason may be the devastating effects of saturated fat on the human digestive system.<br>

What warnings does the Bible give about alcoholic beverages?<br>
“Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise.”-Proverbs 20:1.<br>
“Nor thieves nor the greedy nor the DRUNKARDS nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”-1 Corinthians 6:10.<br>
Alcohol affects the following bodily systems:<br>
“1. The immune system- Alcohol decreases the white cells’ ability to fight disease, thus increasing the risk of pneumonia, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and several cancers.<br>
“2. The endocrine system- Only two or three alcoholic drinks per day increase the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature births.<br>
“3. The circulatory system- The use of alcohol increases the risk of coronary heart disease, reduces blood sugar, and elevates blood fats and blood pressure, thus increasing hypertension.<br>
“4. The digestive system- Alcohol irritates the stomach, thereby causing gastric bleeding…. Habitual use of alcohol raises the risk of fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis of the liver.”<br>
Alcohol is responsible for a large percentage of suicides, auto deaths, child abuse cases, and home violence.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
A person haunted by fear of guilt will find it hard to benefit fully from the health practices we’ve just described. But a person enjoying a positive faith in God will experience the ultimate source of well-being:<br>
“Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits-who forgives all your sins and HEALS ALL YOUR DISEASES, who REDEEMS YOUR LIFE from the pit.”-Psalm 103:2-4.<br>
David Larson, a consultant to the National Institute of Mental Health in the United States, did extensive research on the relationship between religion and health. His study demonstrated a direct connection between a Christian commitment and health. He was surprised to learn: Those who attend church live longer than those who don’t. Church-goers have a reduced incidence of heart attack, hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, and other diseases. Those who have faith in God live more productive lives because they are less likely to be depressed, to become alcoholics, to be jailed as repeat offenders, or to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Trust in divine power is the keystone to genuine well-being and a healthy and happy life.<br>
Approximately 50,000 Seventh-day Adventists were studied, primarily in California, over 30 years. Results showed that Adventist men live 8.9 years longer and women 7.5 years longer than the general population. Studies of Adventists in Holland, Norway, and Poland show similar results. Researchers attribute the longer life span of Adventists to their following some or all of the eight health principles outlined in this guide. Those who follow these principles not only have a longer life, but also a much better quality of life.<br>
Applying the Bible’s perspective to our lives does make a difference in all kinds of practical ways, offering convincing evidence that Christianity is the most practical, reasonable religion in all the world. It changes people-their thinking and their actions-and creates a new lifestyle.<br>
Because of the close relationship between the mind, the body, and our spiritual life, Christians who live by the Word of God will want to follow the principles of a healthful lifestyle as they prepare for Jesus’ second coming (1 John 3:1-3). Christ not only wants us to be ready to meet Him when He returns, He also wants to improve the quality of our present lives. We can cooperate with Him by following God’s basic health principles.<br>
Jesus promises to deliver us from every destructive habit through His “power at work within us” (Ephesians 3:20). If your are attempting to overcome some body-destroying habit such as using tobacco or drinking alcoholic beverages, your best resolutions to quit often turn to ropes of sand. But by tapping God’s power that is “at work within” you, God can give you strength to overcome. The Word of God promises: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).<br>

Here is a thrilling letter from one of our Bible school representatives in Africa:<br>
“Five years ago I received a request from the Voice of Prophecy to visit a prisoner who was a Bible correspondence school student. I presented the request to the prison authorities, who graciously gave permission. Because the student had a deep desire to study the Bible, I visited regularly.<br>
“About six months after my initial visit, he asked to be baptized and join the church. The authorities agreed to provide facilities so the baptism could take place in the prison. The wardens and other prisoners gathered to witness one of the most moving baptisms I have ever conducted.<br>
“Shortly after this, our brother was released from jail, even though he still had considerable time to serve. When I asked why, I was told that his life had changed so drastically, and he was such a witness for his Savior and his religion that he could no longer be thought of as a prisoner, nor be treated as such. This man was united with his family and is now a leader in one of our large congregations.”<br>

When this prisoner became a Christian and his life completely changed, why was it important for him to be baptized? In a conversation with Nicodemus, the community leader who came to Jesus by night, Jesus makes clear the importance and meaning of baptism:<br>
“No one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again… unless he is born of water and the Spirit.”-John 3:3, 5. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
So according to Jesus we must be born “of water and the Spirit.” “Born of the Spirit” signifies entering a new life by undergoing a change of mind and heart. Because entering the kingdom of God involves a completely new kind of existence, not just an old life patched up, it is called the new birth. Water baptism is the outward symbolic portrayal of this inward change. Our representative baptized the prisoner as a recognition of his commitment to Christ an as a symbol of the transformation the Holy Spirit had begun in his character.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Our salvation revolves around three of Christ’s great acts:<br>
“Christ DIED for our sins according to the Scriptures,… he was BURIED,… he was RAISED on the third day according to the Scriptures.”-1 Corinthians 15:3, 4.<br>
Christ made salvation possible through His death, burial, and resurrection.<br>
“Don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were BAPTIZED INTO HIS DEATH? We were therefore BURIED WITH HIM THROUGH BAPTISM into death in order that, JUST AS CHRIST WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD through the glory of the Father, WE TOO MAY LIVE A NEW LIFE.”-Romans 6:3, 4. <br>
Christ died for our sins, was buried, then rose from the grave to give us a new life of righteousness. By being baptized we actually participate in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Baptism means that we have died to sin with Christ, buried the old life of sin with Christ, and we are rising to “live a new life” in Christ. Christ’s death and resurrection becomes our death and resurrection. God can make us dead to sin, as if we’d been crucified. He can make us alive to the things of the Spirit, as if we’d been resurrected from the dead. <br>
The physical act of baptism graphically represents the steps of conversion. First, we’re lowered into the water, we’re immersed completely, just as people who have died are lowered into the grave and covered. This says we are willing to die with Christ and bury our old lifestyle. Baptism is a funeral, a formal farewell to an existence in which sin dominated. Then, we’re lifted up out of the water by the one baptizing, just like a person being resurrected from the grave. This says that we’re a “new creation,” entirely given to the “new life” God gives us.<br>
Only immersion can accurately illustrate the true meaning of baptism-death, burial, and rebirth. “Baptism” by sprinkling doesn’t adequately symbolize the new birth.<br>
What does it really mean to die with Christ?<br>
“For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with [be rendered powerless, margin] that we should no longer be slaves to sin.”-Romans 6:6.<br>
Baptism represents outwardly what a person must do inside: surrender everything to Christ. If we hold anything back from God, then we’ll likely remain “slaves to sin.” When we surrender fully to Christ, our sinful desires are “rendered powerless,” and our transformation begins.<br>
Who is responsible for the change that takes place?<br>
“I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but CHRIST LIVES IN ME. The life I live in the body, I LIVE BY FAITH IN THE SON OF GOD, who loved me and gave himself for me.”-Galatians 2:20.<br>
When I identify with Christ’s crucifixion through baptism, I invite a powerful force into my life-“Christ lives in me.”<br>
In order to put your life fully in Christ’s hands, first look at Christ dying on the cross. Don’t look at the sin that’s threatening you, don’t look at your past record and moan; look to Jesus. Viewing Christ’s gracious and courageous death at Calvary, you can express solidarity with Him: “By the power of the cross I claim that I am dead to old habits and responsive to God. I make my stand with Christ. From now on I will ‘live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.’”<br>
As we tap into the power of Christ’s death and resurrection we see more and more of His good qualities replacing our old habits:<br>
“If anyone is IN CHRIST, he is a NEW CREATION; the OLD has gone, the NEW has come!”-2 Corinthians 5:17.<br>
Through baptism we express our desire to lock arms with Jesus and live a new and better life “in Christ.” Jesus does in us what we could never do for ourselves. We arise from the water “a new creation”; He gives us the power to live a “new” life.<br>

At Pentecost, Peter told those who were seeking release from guilt to “repent and be baptized” so Christ can forgive “your sins” (Acts 2:38). Since Jesus never committed a single sin, Why did He permit Himself to be baptized?<br>
“Then JESUS CAME from Galilee TO THE JORDAN TO BE BAPTIZED by John… TO FULFILL ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS.”-Matthew 3:13, 15.<br>
Jesus was sinless. He didn’t need to repent of any sin. He was baptized for another reason: “to fulfill all righteousness.” By being baptized, Jesus set a positive example for us weak, sinful human beings. Christ never asks His followers to go anywhere He hasn’t been. So when believers are immersed in the waters of baptism, they are following in the steps of the Master.<br>
Because Christ died for our sins, He can give us His righteousness. <br>
“God made him who has no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”-2 Corinthians 5:21.<br>
Transformed in God’s eyes from sinners into saints, we grow into that “righteousness,” and thus we live a new life in Christ.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Christ was immersed at His baptism; He was not sprinkled with water. John baptized Him in the Jordan River “because there was PLENTY OF WATER” (John 3:23). When Jesus was baptized, He went down into the water, and “as soon as Jesus was baptized [immersed, Greek], he went UP OUT OF THE WATER” (Matthew 3:16). <br>
When we understand the true meaning of baptism, we have little difficulty recognizing the authentic form of baptism. The very word “baptize” comes from the Greek word baptizo, and means to dip or immerse (put under).<br>
During John Wesley’s visit to America in 1737, a church jury of 34 men tried him on the strange charge of “refusing to baptize Mr. Parker’s child, except by dipping.” It’s evident that the father of Methodism baptized his converts by immersion.<br>
The reformer John Calvin stated: “It is certain that immersion was the practice of the ancient Church.”-Institute of the Christian Religion, Bk. 4, Chap. 15, Sec. 19.<br>
The history of the early church makes clear that baptism meant immersion. Dean Stanly, of the Church of England, wrote: “For the first thirteen centuries, the almost universal practice of baptism was that of which we read in the New Testament, and which is the very meaning of the word ‘baptize’-that those who were baptized were plunged, submerged, immersed into the water.”-Christian Institutions, p.21.<br>
Baptisteries for immersing converts appear in many of the churches which were built between the fourth and fourteenth centuries in Europe and Asia, churches like cathedral in Pisa, Italy, and St. John’s, the largest church in Rome.<br>
It was not until the Council of Ravenna early in the fifteenth century that the Catholic Church accepted sprinkling as equally valid with immersion. In questions of church practice, we are not to follow what a man teaches, but what Christ and His apostles teach.<br>
Many sincere Christians cherish the tradition of infant baptism, and giving our children to God from the very beginning is certainly commendable. The Bible, however, makes it clear that a person must be taught the way of salvation before baptism (Matthew 28:19, 20), that a person must believe in Jesus before being baptized (Acts 8:35-38), and that a person must repent of sin and be forgiven before being baptized (Acts 2:38). A baby is incapable of believing, repentance, or confession, which must precede baptism.<br>

According to Jesus, baptism is essential for those who wish to enter heaven:<br>
“No one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.”-John 3:5.<br>
Jesus gives only one exception. The thief on the cross was “born of the Spirit,” even though it was impossible for him to leave the cross and be immersed in water as a sign of his change of heart. And Jesus promised him that he would be with Him in the kingdom (Luke 23:42, 43). For the thief, being “born of water and of the Spirit” represents the blood of Jesus which was being spilt to cleanse him from his sins. Augustine observed, “There is one case of deathbed repentance recorded, that of the penitent thief, that none should despair; and only one, that none should presume.”<br>
Jesus Himself gave this solemn warning:<br>
“Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe [and therefore is not baptized] will be condemned.”-Mark 16:16.<br>
By dying in our place at Calvary, Jesus made a public demonstration of His love for us. We need to respond with a public, unashamed confession of our commitment to Christ through baptism. Have you begun a new life in Christ? Have you been baptized? If not, why not prepare for baptism in the near future?<br>

Baptism represents our commitment to a Christian lifestyle. But our surrender at baptism doesn’t automatically last a lifetime.<br>
When a child is born, a celebration is in order. After the day of birth is over and the excitement subsides, the baby requires daily feeding, daily bathing, and daily concern for its welfare. It’s much the same with baptism. Paul said of his experience, “I die every day” (1 Corinthians 15:31). By daily turning from selfishness, we become more and more responsive to Christ.<br>
The rite of baptism, like the wedding ceremony, was meant to be the formal confirmation that a wonderful and growing relationship has begun. In order to grow consistently, we need a daily giving of ourselves to Christ, a daily reception of a new life through prayer and Bible study.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Baptism is cause for great rejoicing because those who place their faith in Christ have the assurance of eternal life. “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved” (Mark 16:16). When we are baptized, we’re on an upward path leading us to eternal joy.<br>
Baptism also celebrates a present happiness with Christ. He promises the priceless gift of the Holy Spirit to those baptized (Acts 2:38). With the Spirit comes “the fruit of the Spirit”-“love,” which fills the life with “patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control” (Galatians 5:22, 23).<br>
Having Jesus living inside us by His Holy Spirit gives a profound sense of certainty.<br>
For “the Spirit Himself testifies… that we are God’s children” (Romans 8:15, 16).<br>
This secure relationship with God brings us many benefits, but is doesn’t guarantee a problem-free life. In fact, the enemy often tries to throw the most difficulties at those who’ve just made a commitment to Christ. However, when we’re in God’s hands we can know that He will use everything that happens to us, good and bad, to teach us and help us grow (see Romans 8:28).<br>
A young woman made a decision to commit her life to Christ and be baptized, in spite of her husband’s threat of divorce. He wanted no part of her new faith, but she stuck to Jesus and tried to become a more loving wife than ever before. For some time the husband made things difficult at home. But finally he was won over by and argument he couldn’t answer: her transformed life. This man surrendered his life to Christ and he too was baptized.<br>
Sticking close to Christ through “thick and thin” will make us powerful instruments in His hands. We can commit our lives to Him unconditionally because He has already made the ultimate commitment to us when He paid the price for our sins on the cross. What a privilege it is to publicly give Him our love and allegiance! If you haven’t yet done so, why not surrender your life to Christ right now. Ask Him to create a new life in you by the Holy Spirit, and then be baptized into Christ.<br>

In the early 1960s, Brother Andrew, a man from Holland, smuggled a load of Bibles in his VW across the Romanian border and past communist guards. He checked into a hotel and began praying that God would lead him to the right Christian groups-the ones who could best use his copies of the Scriptures.<br>
That weekend Andrew walked up to the hotel clerk and asked where he might find a church. <br>
The clerk looked at him a little strangely and answered, “We don’t have many of those, you know. Besides you couldn’t understand the language.”<br>
“Didn’t you know?” Andrew replied, “Christians speak a kind of universal language.”<br>
“Oh, what’s that?”<br>
“It’s called Agape.”<br>
The clerk had never heard of it, but Andrew assured him, “It’s the most beautiful language in the world.”<br>
Andrew was able to locate several church groups in the area and managed to arrange a meeting with the president and secretary of a certain denomination. Unfortunately, although both Andrew and these men knew several European languages, they found they had none in common. So there they sat staring at each other. Andrew had traveled many dangerous miles with his precious cargo, but there seemed no way of telling whether these men were genuine Christian brothers or government informants.<br>
Finally he spotted a Romanian Bible on a desk in the office. Andrew reached into his pocket and pulled out a Dutch Bible. He turned to 1 Corinthians 16:20 and held the Bible out, pointing to the name of the book, which they could recognize. Instantly their faces lit up. They quickly found the same chapter and verse in their Romanian Bibles and read: “All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.”<br>
The men beamed back at Andrew. Then one of them looked through his Bible and found Proverbs 25:25. Andrew found the verse and read: “Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land.”<br>
These men spent half an hour conversing and sharing-just through the words of Scripture. They were so happy in this fellowship that crossed all cultural boundaries that they laughed until tears came to their eyes.<br>
Andrew knew he had found his brothers. When he showed them his load of Bibles, the Romanians were overwhelmed and embraced him again and again.<br>
That evening at the hotel, the clerk approached Andrew and remarked, “Say, I looked up ‘agape’ in the dictionary. There’s no language by that name. That’s just a Greek word for love.”<br>
Andrew replied, “That’s it. I was speaking in it all afternoon.”<br>
Have you discovered that beautiful language? In this Guide you’ll learn about how God can bring all of us into His great circle of love.<br>

Jesus established the church in order to meet the basic human requirement of nurture and support. We all have needs. And that’s what the church is all about. It’s a place where we come to fellowship and help each other. Scripture reveals a dynamic apostolic church which called men and women into a joyful fellowship that extended all the way up to the Almighty:<br>
“We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have FELLOWSHIP WITH US. And OUR FELLOWSHIP IS WITH THE FATHER AND WITH HIS SON, Jesus Christ. We write this to make our JOY COMPLETE.”-1 John 1:3, 4. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
A community of hearts bonded through contact with Jesus and with one another, experience “joy” to the fullest! They’re all speaking the same language, the language of love.<br>
Christians become part of an extended family. They become brothers and sisters in Christ since all have a kindred spirit. The broader the unity of belief, the stronger the ties among Christians.<br>
The members of the churches established by Jesus’ apostles were bound together by their similar beliefs, their love of God, and their desire to serve Him and share His grace to the world. This close bond of fellowship was one of the reasons this powerless and persecuted minority turned the world upside down.<br>

Does Christ have a church, or is the whole idea of religious organization just a human invention? Jesus answers:<br>
“On this ROCK I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.”-Matthew 16:18, margin.<br>
Jesus is the anchoring Rock, the Cornerstone, of His church.<br>
What group formed a part of the foundation?<br>
“Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone.”-Ephesians 2:20.<br>
What did the Lord accomplish when the gospel was preached?<br>
“And the Lord added to the CHURCH daily such as should be saved.”-Acts 2:47, KJV.<br>
When Jesus established the church, He promised that “the gates of hell will not overcome it” (Matthew 16:18), and the Christian church still endures. It has had extremely powerful enemies-from Roman emperors to communist dictators-but the blood of martyrs has only caused it to grow stronger. When one Christian was burned at the stake or tossed to the lions, several others sprang up to take his or her place. Skeptics have done their best to reason the Christian Church away. But Christian truth competes more eloquently than ever in a scientific, secular age. <br>
One of the church’s greatest challenges came soon after its acceptance as the official religion of the Roman Empire. The church grew prosperous-and eventually was corrupted. It seemed spiritually dead in the Dark Ages. But the Lord always preserved a core of courageous and faithful believers who, in the bleak and difficult times, shone bright as stars on a moonless night.<br>
Paul compares Christ’s relationship to His church to a husband’s tender, protective relationship to His wife (Ephesians 5:23-25). The church is a family, with each member establishing relationships to the other members of the family and contributing to their well-being (Ephesians 2:19).<br>
Paul also represents the church as a living body, with Christ Himself as its head (Colossians 1:18).<br>
When we are baptized, we testify to our faith in Jesus and become members of the “body,” the church.<br>
“For we are all BAPTIZED by one Spirit INTO ONE BODY.”-1 Corinthians 12:13.<br>
The book of Revelation pictures the risen Christ walking among the churches, showing His care over them (Revelation 1:20, 12, 13). Christ has never forsaken His people, and He never will.<br>

Church attendance is vital for a Christian. We need the support of others to keep our faith alive and growing.<br>
The church also plays three other important roles:<br>
(1)The church guards the truth.<br>
As the “pillar and foundation of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15), the church upholds and defends God’s truth before the world. We need the collective wisdom of other believers to help us focus on the essential truths of Scripture.<br>
(2)The church is an example of what God’s grace can do for sinners. The changes that Christ has made in the lives of believers give acclaim to the God who calls us “into his wonderful light” (1 Peter 2:9).<br>
(3)God’s people are His witnesses to a needy world. Just before He returned to heaven, Jesus promised His disciples:<br>
“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”-Acts 1:8.<br>
It is a great privilege for the church to take the message of God’s tremendous love worldwide.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The church that Christ established has a definite organization. One could be included in, or excluded from, its membership (Matthew 18:15-18). God’s church appointed leaders and had a world headquarters as well as local meeting places (Acts 8:14; 14:23; 15:2; 1Timothy 3:1-13). When they were baptized, believers joined an organized group. (Acts 2:41 and 47).<br>
The church exists for mutual encouragement.<br>
“And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but LET US ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER-and all the more as you see the Day [of Christ’s coming] approaching.”-Hebrews 10:24, 25. <br>
This is, in a nutshell, what a healthy church group does. Its members build each other up in the faith, they encourage one another. God organized His church to strengthen God’s people and also to serve the world. We can do far more together than we can as isolated individuals. Take just one example: Seventh-day Adventist Church. We carry on an extensive medical work around the world-from inner-city health vans to clinics in remote islands of the South Pacific. Our educational institutions have brought tens of thousands of youth to a knowledge of a better life in Christ-from Loma Linda University, pioneering in heart transplants, to tiny mission schools scattered through the African interior. We carry on famine and disaster relief through ADRA. Local churches help clothe and feed the poor and homeless at thousands of Community Service Centers. And groups of Adventists believers are sharing the message of salvation in more than 200 countries. Only an organized group of dedicated Christian could have this worldwide impact.<br>
Christ and the apostles compared the church to a body, and pointed out that all parts of the body are needed (1 Corinthians 12:21-28). All body parts are not exactly alike, yet all are important and all must work together in harmony. An eye separated from the body can’t see. A hand cut off has no value. Whether we are an eye, a hand, or only a finger, we can’t be truly effective for Christ totally on our own. Belonging to a church, being united to the other members of the body, strengthens us as Christians.<br>

Deep in our hearts lies a longing to worship God, and that need can wither away unless given expression. How did the psalmist feel when he thought about going to a place of worship?<br>
“I REJOICED with those who said to me, ‘Let us go to the house of the LORD.”-Psalm 122:1.<br>
What part does music have in public worship?<br>
“Worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs.”-Psalm 100:2.<br>
The Bible tells us that giving offerings is an appropriate part of divine worship.<br>
“Bring an offering and come into his courts. Worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.”-Psalm 96:8-9.<br>
Prayer is also a vital aspect of public worship.<br>
“Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.”-Psalm 95:6.<br>
Bible study and preaching are central to New Testament worship. Beginning with Peter’s sermon on the day of Pentecost, found in Acts 2, and from the time of the Protestant Reformers to our day, every great religious revival has been based on biblical preaching. Why? Because “the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword” (Hebrews 4:12-13).<br>

Some object that the church is full of imperfect people. What Henry Ward Beecher said is true: “The church is not a gallery for the exhibition of eminent Christians, but a school for the education of imperfect ones.”<br>
Since none of us is perfect, the church will never be perfect either. In one of His parables Jesus reminded us that weeds grow among the wheat (Matthew 13:24-30). When we read the New Testament letters of Paul, we discover that the apostolic church had critical problems. And the church today often has serious defects. But please remember that no faulty congregation can ever destroy or disturb the Great Cornerstone of the church-Jesus Christ Himself. So in imperfect churches we must keep our primary gaze on the Savior who ministers to us. Despite its faults, the church belongs to Him, so focus on Christ.<br>
“CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH AND GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR HER to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.”-Ephesians 5:25-27.<br>
The church is so important to Jesus that He “gave himself up for her” when He died for each of us individually and for the church collectively. So church membership should be important to you. Are you a member of Christ’s body?<br>

How many true faiths does Jesus have in the world?<br>
“There is one body and one Spirit,…one Lord, ONE FAITH, one baptism.”-Ephesians 4:4, 5.<br>
Since Christ has only “one faith,” how can we know which one it is? Jesus gives us the key:<br>
“If anyone chooses to do God’s will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.”-John 7:17. (See also John 8:31, 32.)<br>
When we make a commitment to do God’s will, He will help us see whether the teaching is from God or is only human tradition. The key ingredient when finding a church is examining its respect for and allegiance to the Word of God. Genuine fellowship is built around Scripture, not just around a charismatic leader or a great institution.<br>
Continue making discoveries in these guides, walk in the light as God reveals it to you from the Bible, and He will make plain His will for you. A growing Christian is a person who opens heart and mind to accept the truth as God reveals it from His Word.<br>

In Guide 16 we discovered that experiencing Sabbath rest is an important antidote to today’s stressful living. Since God understands our every need, He established each seventh day for our physical rest and our spiritual refreshment. After creating our world in six days, He “rested” on the seventh day, “blessed” and “made it holy” (Genesis 2:1-3).<br>
When God gave the Ten Commandments to His people, Israel, He placed the commandments to observe the seventh-day Sabbath at the heart of His law (Exodus 20:8-11). According to this commandment, the Sabbath is a memorial of God’s creative power, a day to pause and think about the beauties and wonders of His created works, a day to relax and come close to our Creator, a day to explore in greater depth our relationship with Him.<br>
During Jesus’ human life on earth, He too kept the Sabbath (Luke 4:16) and endorsed it as a day that benefits Christians (Mark 2:27, 28). Several texts in the book of Acts make it clear that Christ’s disciples worshiped on the Sabbath after His resurrection (Acts 13:14; 16:13; 17:2; 18:1-4, 11).<br>

This brings us to a subject that many find perplexing. The Christian world has for some time observed two different days. On one hand, most Christians sincerely observe Sunday, the first day of the week, which they believe to be a memorial of Christ’s resurrection. On the other hand, a large group of Christians, equally sincere, believe that the Bible honors only the seventh-day as the Sabbath and nowhere affirms the sanctity of Sunday.<br>
Does it really make any difference which day we observe as the Sabbath? As sincere and earnest people who want to know the truth, we must always ask ourselves: “What matters to Jesus? What does Jesus desire me to do?”<br>
In coming to a decision about this, several important facts need to be made clear: Who changed the Sabbath from Saturday, the seventh day of the week, to Sunday, the first day of the week? Does the Bible authorize such a shift? If so, did God, Christ, or perhaps the apostles make the change?<br>
We’ll proceed by looking at all the possibilities.<br>

Is there any pronouncement from God that changes the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week?<br>
Most Christians accept the Ten Commandments as a valid guide to live by. They are the only message God have ever personally written out for the human race. They are so important, He wrote them on stone with His own finger (Exodus 31:18).<br>
In the fourth commandment God instructs us:<br>
“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but THE SEVENTH DAY IS THE SABBATH TO THE LORD YOUR GOD. On it you shall not do any work…. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he RESTED on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD BLESSED the Sabbath day and MADE IT HOLY.”-Exodus 20:8-11. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
When God gave the Ten Commandments to His people, He also made it clear that no human being should revise or edit the instruction from His holy lips.<br>
“DO NOT ADD to what I command you and DO NOT SUBTRACT from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you.”-Deuteronomy 4:2.<br>
God Himself pledges not to alter His commands:<br>
“I WILL NOT violate my covenant or ALTER WHAT MY LIPS HAVE UTTERED.”-Psalm 89:34.<br>
The Bible is clear that God did not change the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week.<br>

According to Jesus, the Ten Commandments are not subject to change:<br>
“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.”-Matthew 5:17-18.<br>
In guide 16 we discovered that it was Jesus’ custom to worship in the synagogue on the Sabbath (Luke 4:16). We also discovered that Jesus wanted His disciples to continue experiencing the joys of true Sabbath-keeping (Matthew 24:20).<br>
It is clear from Jesus’ teaching and example that we still need the Sabbath for rest, relaxation, and spending time with God.<br>

James, the first leader of the early Christian church, wrote concerning the Ten Commandments:<br>
“For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.”-James 2:10, 11.<br>
Luke, a physician and evangelist in the early church, reports:<br>
“On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.”-Acts 16:13.<br>
The New Testament book of Acts mentions 84 times when the Sabbath was observed by Christ’s followers, all of them more than 14 years after the resurrection of Jesus: 2 Sabbaths at Antioch (Acts 13:14, 42, 44); 1 at Philippi (Acts 16:13); 3 at Thessalonica (Acts 17:2, 3); 78 Sabbaths at Corinth (Acts 18:4, 11).<br>
John, the last of the twelve apostles to die, kept the Sabbath. He wrote:<br>
“On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit.”-Revelation 1:10.<br>
According to Jesus, the Lord’s Day is the Sabbath:<br>
“The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”-Matthew 12:8.<br>
A search of the scriptural evidence reveals that the apostles made no attempt to change God’s day of rest from the seventh to the first day of the week. The New Testament mentions the first day of the week only eight times. In none of these instances is the first day of the week spoken of as a holy day, nor is it even hinted that we should set it aside as a day of worship. A critical examination of the eight texts referring to the first day of the week points out these Sunday events:<br>
(1) The women came to the tomb on the first day of the week (Matthew 28:1).<br>
(2) “When the Sabbath was over” the women resumed their secular activities on the first day of the week (Mark 16:1, 2).<br>
(3)Jesus appeared first to Mary Magdalene early the first day of the week (Mark 16:9).<br>
(4)Jesus’ followers resumed their secular activities on the first day of the week (Luke 24:1).<br>
(5)Mary went to the grave of Jesus and found the tomb empty on the first day of the week (John 20:1).<br>
(6)The disciples gathered together “for fear of the Jews” (not worship) on the first day of the week (John 20:19).<br>
(7)Paul asked church members to take account of their funds on the first day of the week, and “set aside a sum of money” for the poor at Jerusalem (1 Corinthians 16:1, 2). The passage does not mention any religious meeting.<br>
(8)In Acts 20:7 Luke speaks of Paul’s preaching on the first day of the week at an incidental farewell meeting. Of course Paul preached every day, and the apostles broke bread daily (Acts 2:46).<br>
None of these scriptures suggest that the apostles intended to stop observing the seventh-day Sabbath. The apostles mentioned no change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week. There is clearly no New Testament evidence for a change of the Sabbath from Saturday, the seventh day of the week, to Sunday, the first day of the week. The change came after the days of Jesus and the apostles, so we must turn to history to see when and how the change came about.<br>

The apostles clearly warn us that some Christians would drift away from the doctrines of New Testament Christianity: “So be on guard!” (Acts 20:29-31). And that is exactly what happened. Credible historians clearly record how Christians began to stray from apostolic purity. Traditions and doctrines which Paul, Peter, and the other founders of the Christian church had never endorsed gradually crept into the church.<br>
The change from Sabbath observance to Sunday observance took place after the New Testament was completed and the apostles had all died. History records that Christians eventually shifted from worshiping and resting on the seventh day to the first day of the week. But of course believers didn’t stop observing the seventh-day Sabbath on a given weekend and then suddenly begin keeping Sunday as the Lord’s Day. The earliest authentic instance of Sunday observance by Christians occurred in Italy, in the middle of the second century after Christ. For a long time after that many Christians observed both days, while still others kept only the Sabbath.<br>
On March 7, A.D.321, Constantine the Great issued the first civil Sunday law, compelling all the people, except the farmers, in the Roman Empire to rest on Sunday. This, with five other civil laws decreed by Constantine concerning Sunday, set the legal precedent for all civil Sunday legislation from that time to the present. In the fourth century the Council of Laodicea prohibited Christians from abstaining from work on the Sabbath, while urging them to honor Sunday by abstaining from work if at all possible.<br>
History shows that Sunday worship and observance is a man-made custom. The Bible gives no authority for doing away with the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment. The prophet Daniel predicted that during the Christian era a deceptive power would attempt to change God’s law (Daniel 7:25).<br>

Who officially moved the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day of the week? The Catholic Church claims to have done so. In an attempt to save the crumbling Roman Empire, well-meaning church leaders compromised and attempted to change the day of worship from Saturday to Sunday.<br>
A catechism of the Roman Catholic Church reads:<br>
“Q. Which is the Sabbath day?<br>
“A. Saturday is the Sabbath day.<br>
“Q. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?<br>
“A. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church… transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.”-Peter Geiermann, The Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine (1957 edition), p.50<br>
The Catholic Church proudly announces that human church leaders made the change.<br>
“The holy day, the Sabbath, was changed from Saturday to Sunday… not from any directions noted in the Scriptures, but from the Church’s sense of its own power…. People who think that the Scriptures should be the sole authority, should logically become 7th Day Adventists, and keep Saturday holy.”-Cardinal Maida, Archbishop of Detroit, Saint Catherine Catholic Church Sentinel, Algonac, Michigan, May 21, 1995.<br>

Official documents outlining the beliefs of several Protestant denominations agree that the Bible provides no authority for Sunday observance.<br>
Martin Luther, founder of the Lutheran Church, wrote in the Augsburg Confession, Article 28, paragraph 9:<br>
“They [the Roman Catholics] allege the Sabbath changed into Sunday, the Lord’s Day, contrary to the decalogue [the Ten Commandments],… neither is there any example more boasted of than the changing of the Sabbath day. Great, say they, is the power and authority of the church, since it dispensed with one of the ten commandments.”<br>
Methodist theologians Amos Binney and Daniel Steele observed:<br>
“It is true, there is no positive command for infant baptism… nor is there any for keeping holy the first day of the week.”-Theological Compend (New York: Methodist Book Concern, 1902), pp. 180, 181.<br>
Dr. N. Summerbell, historian of the Disciples of Christ or Christian Church, wrote: “The Roman Church had totally apostatized…. It reversed the Fourth Commandment by doing away with the Sabbath of God’s Word, and instituting Sunday as a holy day.”-A True History of the Christian and the Christian Church, pp. 417, 418.<br>

This brings us face-to-face with the questions: Why do so many Christians observe Sunday without Bible authority? Even more important, Which day shall I keep? Shall I follow those who say, “I don’t think it makes any difference which day I observe as long as I keep one day in seven”? Or, shall I count as important the day Jesus, our Creator, established when He created our world, and the day God pointed out in the Ten Commandments: “the seventh day is the Sabbath”?<br>
Here we are dealing with more than just an outward observance, but which day happens to be biblically correct. The essential issue is that of obedience to Jesus. Our Creator set aside the Sabbath as a “holy” day, as a time for us and our families to come closer to Him for strength and refreshment. Whom shall I obey? Shall I obey Christ, the Son of God, or human tradition in the matter of the day I keep holy? The choice is clear: the teachings of men or the commands of God. The word of men or the Word of the God. A human substitute or a divine command.<br>
The prophet Daniel sounds a warning to those who would “try to change the set times and the laws” (Daniel 7:25, NIV) [“intend to change times and law” (Daniel 7:25, NKJV)]. God is calling His people back to obedience. He invites them to keep the Sabbath as a symbol of loyalty and love to Him.<br>
Jesus said, “If you love me, you will obey what I command” (John 14:15). And He promises fullness of joy to those who love Him enough to obey His commands (John 15:9-11). We have a wonderful Savior. He is eager for us to experience His love in all its fullness. A heart of willing obedience opens the door wide to that love.<br>
In the Garden of Gethsemane Christ submitted completely to the Father’s will-even though He faced the cross and the sins of the world were crushing out His life. As He cried out to God, “Take this cup from me,” He remained surrendered in His pleading, and added, “Yet not what I will, but what you will” (Mark 14:36).<br>
Christ longs for us to experience the fulfillment that a truly surrendered life brings. And He also wants us to experience the joy of Sabbath rest. He wants us to trust Him enough to obey Him in all the details of life. If you answer God’s call and obey all of His commandments, you will experience the promise of Jesus that His joy will “be in you” and “your joy” will “be complete” (John 15:11).<br>

The tragedies go on and on in our world. And we long so much for an answer to it all. Where is God in a world of meaningless suffering and death? The psalmist assures us that “the earth is full of his unfailing love” (Psalms 33:5).<br>
But if that is true, Why doesn’t He bring an end to suffering and tragedy? The 20th chapter of Revelation shows us how and when God will bring sin and suffering to an end.<br>

Revelation 20 zeros in on a 1,000-year period that follows the second coming of Christ. The events surrounding this 1,000-year period are the final act in the conflict between Christ and Satan that has been going on since sin entered the universe.<br>
This drama began in heaven when Lucifer became jealous of Christ, started a war with the unfallen angels, was expelled, and fled to our world. The drama continued on earth in the Garden of Eden, then down through the centuries until it reached its first climax when the Devil impelled human beings to crucify Christ. (You may wish to review this sad story in Guide 3.) The drama will reached its final climax at the close of the 1,000-year period when our sinful world is cleansed and placed under Christ’s control. Revelation 20 shows us that the 1,000-year period is separated by two resurrections.<br>
Who does God raise from the dead in the first resurrection that takes place at the beginning of the 1,000 years? <br>
“Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.”-Revelation 20:6. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
The “blessed and holy,” those who have accepted Jesus as their Savior, come up in the “first resurrection.” If the righteous are to “reign with” Christ during the 1,000 years, they must be resurrected at the beginning of the 1,000 years.<br>
Who are raised in the second resurrection at the close of the thousand-year period?<br>
“The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.”-Revelation 20:5.<br>
The “rest of the dead” can refer only to the wicked dead, because the righteous, “the blessed and holy,” are resurrected at the beginning of the 1,000 years.<br>
So the 1,000-year period is marked off by two resurrections: the resurrection of the righteous at its beginning, and the resurrection of the wicked at its close.<br>

The first resurrection, that of the righteous, takes place at the second coming of Christ.<br>
”For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with… the trumpet call of God, and THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL RISE first. After that, WE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE and are left WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM in the clouds TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR. And so we will be with the Lord forever.”-Thessalonians 4:16, 17.<br>
When Jesus comes to this earth, He raises “the dead in Christ” and takes them, along with the righteous who are alive, to heaven. Because the wicked still cling to sin, they can’t exist in God’s presence, and they are destroyed at Christ’s coming (Luke 17:26-30). (You may wish to review in Guide 8 the events surrounding Jesus’ return.)<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
When the 1,000 years begin, the righteous have all gone to heaven and the wicked are all dead. What will happen on this world during the 1,000 years?<br>
“And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended.”-Revelation 20:1-3.<br>
At Jesus’ coming Satan is bound and will remain in chains during the 1,000 years. Where is Satan imprisoned? In the “Abyss,” a Greek word that means “very deep” or “bottomless.” In Genesis 1:2 the Greek version of the Old Testament uses the word “Abyss” to describe the earth in its undeveloped state before the days of creation began. So our earth is the Abyss where God imprisons Satan.<br>
Scriptures describes Satan as bound by “a great chain.” Is this a literal chain? No, it is symbolic, a chain of circumstances. Satan would like very much to continue deceiving people during the 1,000 years. But he can find no righteous people to tempt, because they are all in heaven. And he can find no wicked to lead, because they are all dead, asleep in the dust of the earth. Unable to deceive or tempt anyone, he roams an empty world forced to ponder all the heartaches and tragedy he has caused.<br>

The thousand-year period is also a time of judgment. But remember that the judgment consists of four main stages:<br>
(1)The pre-advent judgment of the righteous before Christ’s second coming.<br>
(2)The reward of the righteous at the Second Coming.<br>
(3)The judgment of the wicked during the 1,000 years.<br>
(4)The reward of Satan and the wicked at the end of that period. (You may wish to review Guide 13 that deals with stages 1 and 2 of the judgment, the investigation and reward of the righteous.) We will now look at stages 3 and 4, the investigation and reward of the wicked.<br>
We’ve seen that the righteous dead who have been resurrected and the righteous who are alive are taken to heaven together at the second coming of Christ. They are at home in heaven during 1,000 years. What will they be doing?<br>
“Do you not know that THE SAINTS [the saved] WILL JUDGED THE WORLD?... Do you not know that we will JUDGE ANGELS?”-1 Corinthians 6:2-3.<br>
“I SAW THE THRONES ON WHICH WERE SEATED THOSE WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN AUTHORITY TO JUDGE….THEY CAME TO LIFE AND REIGNED WITH CHRIST A THOUSAND YEARS.”-Revelation 20:4.<br>
During the 1,000 years, the righteous will review the cases of wicked human beings and fallen angels, including their leader, Satan. How fitting for the martyrs, the overcomers, and battle-scarred adherents of the gospel to examine and understand God’s judgment of the wicked.<br>
God has graciously given redeemed human beings the change to evaluate His dealings with the wicked. We may have a lot of questions, like: “Why isn’t my aunt here? She seemed like such a good person.” When we go over the records and judge the dead “according to what they had done as recorded in the books” (verse 12), we will see for ourselves that in all His dealings with human beings, God has been just and fair with everyone. We’ll see how the Holy Spirit offered people chance after chance to yield to God, and the fairness of each sentence will become plain.<br>

At the close of the 1,000 years, the Bible declares:<br>
“I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.”-Revelation 21:2.<br>
This wonderful city has been our home for a thousand years. Now the Holy City-with Christ and all the people He’s redeemed inside-descends from heaven to our world. <br>
What does Satan do at the close of the 1,000 years?<br>
“When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth… to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore. They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves.”-Revelation 20:7-9.<br>
The wicked are resurrected in the second resurrection at the close of the 1,000 years (verse 5). When the righteous descend to earth in the Holy City and the wicked are resurrected, Satan will be “set free for a short time” (verse 3). He again has the wicked to lead and the righteous as his target. Not wasting a moment, he immediately begins to organize the wicked into a vast army. Satan gives the command to march against the city. As the wicked take up positions around the New Jerusalem (verse 9), they catch a glimpse of the horror of being lost-lost forever.<br>

Here, for the first time, all the human race meets together face-to-face. Jesus leads the redeemed children of God who are inside the city. Satan heads the throngs of the wicked who are outside the walls. At this critical moment, God carries out the final stage of judgment and the wicked receive their day in court. <br>
“Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it…. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and…. the dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.”-Revelation 20:11, 12.<br>
As the wicked stand before the throne of justice, their whole life opens before them. From the records contained in heaven, Jesus, the righteous Judge, formally unfolds the full story of His dealings with fallen men, women, and angels.<br>
The entire universe looks on with intense interest. Standing before the throne of God, Jesus gives everyone a comprehensive view of His redemptive work. He reveals that He came to seek and save the lost. He entered our world in human flesh, lived a sinless life amid struggles and temptations, made the ultimate sacrifice on the cross, and served as our Priest in heaven. Finally, when Christ sorrowfully steps forward and passes sentence on those who’ve persisted in rejecting His grace, every being in the universe will acknowledge the justice and necessity of this final act of divine judgment.<br>
“We will all stand before God’s judgment seat. It is written: ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.’”-Romans 14:10-11.<br>
“Christ Jesus… become obedient to death-even death on a cross!... At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth,… and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”-Philippians 2:5-11.<br>
Ever since sin began, the Devil has been slandering God’s character, accusing Him of being unfair. But now all the questions are answered, all the perplexities resolved. Now every being in the universe acknowledges that Jesus, the Lamb of God, is worthy of our love and worship. The whole plan and purpose of God is now fully revealed, and God’s character stands vindicated.<br>
Not only the saved, but also evil angels and Satan himself will confess that Satan’s&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Even though Satan and the vast throng of wicked people admit that God’s way is right, their hearts are not changed, their characters remain evil. And after judgment is pronounced, the wicked:<br>
“Marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur…. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”-Revelation 20:9-15.<br>
In final judgment the fires of the eternal God will destroy sin and those who stubbornly cling to it. Satan and all the lost perish in this “second death,” an eternal death from which there is no awakening. Their course of rebellion has left the wicked unfit for real happiness, and they are destroyed with the Devil and his angels. The heavenly fire completely cleanses the earth of the ravages of sin; God has a clean universe at last, never again to be scarred by evil. The epic struggle between good and evil, between Christ and Satan, is finally over, and Christ reigns. The curtain falls on the ancient drama of sin, and rises on the glory of a new world of limitless possibilities.<br>

From the ashes of this final, cleansing holocaust, God will create a new world:<br>
“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away…. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God… ‘Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away…. I am making everything new!’”-Revelation 21:1-5.<br>
Restored to its original beauty, the earth becomes the home of the redeemed for endless ages. Freed from selfishness, sickness, and suffering, we have a whole universe to explore, wonderful relationships to develop, and an eternity in which to sit at Jesus’ feet to listen, learn, and love. (For a full description of that new world, you may wish to again read Guide 9.)<br>
Where do you plan to be in that day? Have you decided to be with Christ inside the city and saved forever? Or will you be outside the city without Christ and lost forever?<br>
If you have placed your life in the hands of Jesus, you need never experience the unspeakable horror of those on the outside of the city who realize they are lost forever. No matter what life has brought to you, if you place your life in the hands of Jesus now, you can be inside the city with Christ and the redeemed. If you have not done so, give your heart to Jesus now, and He will surround you with His love and forgiveness. This is your opportunity. This is your day of salvation.<br>

A senseless shooting occurred when a student marched into his school and killed several of his classmates. A disgruntled man who had been fired from his job, entered the place of his former employment and shot his superior. A mother pushed her car into a lake with her two children inside and drowned them.<br>
On at least two continents many thousands have been slaughtered in ethnic cleansing. Centuries old feuds between two or more ethnic groups are the reason. Men, women, children, and even babies have been shot, cut up, beat up, and raped.<br>
Punishing these barbaric crimes with the death penalty, even for cold-blooded murderers, is condemned by many. Groups against the death penalty protest loudly, calling it an inhumane “paganistic ritual.” They ask, are these killers beyond redemption?<br>
What is the most humane way of executing condemned criminals? The electric chair? Some think an injection with a lethal drug would be the most painless. Others maintain that life would end more quickly by hanging.<br>
But in all this passionate debate over the death penalty, there is one option no one considers. No one suggests that cold-blooded killers, who have cruelly ended another’s life, pay with physical agony by being tortured to death. No one, for example, has suggested that these murderers slowly burn to death.<br>
But many sincere Christians do assume that our heavenly Father will do more than that. The wicked, they say, must be tortured in order to pay for their sins. And what’s more, they picture God’s execution grounds as a place of endless torment.<br>
Just what does happen to the wicked? How does their fate fit in with God’s love and justice? Let’s look for the Bible answer.<br>

For 6,000 years God has been pleading with men and women:<br>
“As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live.”-Ezekiel 33:11. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
The cross revealed how much God wants to rescue fallen humanity. When Jesus cried out on the cross, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing,” He laid bare His aching heart (Luke 23:34). Soon afterward Jesus yielded up His life and, some believe, died of a broken heart (John 19:30, 34).<br>
But even with this powerful demonstration of divine love, many individuals will still not turn to Jesus. And as long as sin rules in this world, it will continue to multiply human misery. So sin has to be destroyed. How does God plan to put an end to sin?<br>
“The day of the Lord will come…. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the EARTH AND EVERYTHING IN IT WILL BE BURNED UP.”-2 Peter 3:10, margin.<br>
God must finally cleanse the universe of evil and put an end to sin. Those who persist in holding on to sin will eventually destroyed by this fire that is prepared to destroy the Devil, his angels, and sin from our world. What a heartbreaking time for Jesus as He sees the fire consume the ones He Died to save.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Contrary to some popular conceptions, God doesn’t have a fire burning now in a place termed “hell” where sinners go at death. Hell happens when this earth is turned into a lake of fire. God waits to carry out the sentence on the wicked until the final judgment at the end of the 1,000 years (Revelation 20:9-15).<br>
“The Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment until THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.”-2 Peter 2:9, margin.<br>
He also cleanses our world with this purifying fire.<br>
“The present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for THE DAY OF JUDGMENT and destruction of ungodly men.”-2 Peter 3:7.<br>
God never planned for any human being to end his or her life in the fires of hell. But when people refuse to break with Satan and hold on to their sins, they must finally receive the consequences of their choices.<br>
“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS.’”-Matthew 25:41.<br>
According to Jesus, when will hell burn?<br>
“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be AT THE END OF THE AGE [WORLD, KJV]. The Son of Man will send out his ANGELS, and they will WEED OUT of his kingdom EVERYTHING THAT CAUSES SIN AND ALL WHO DO EVIL. THEY WILL THROW THEM INTO THE FIERY FURNACE, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.-Matthew 13:40-42.<br>
The weeds, the evil-doers, aren’t burned until the end of the world. Before this sentence is carried out, the whole universe must be assured that God has been fair in his dealings with every human being. As detailed in Guide 22, in the great controversy going on between Christ and Satan, Satan has been attempting to prove to the universe that the way of sin is the better way; Jesus has been demonstrating that the way of obedience is the key to a more satisfying life.<br>
At the close of the 1,000 years, this demonstration will culminate in the judgment of Satan, his angles, and the wicked. After the record books are opened which reveal the part that each person has played in this great drama, God will throw Satan, death, and the grave, along with everyone whose name “was not found written in the book of life… into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:14-15). According to the next verse, Revelation 21:1, after God cleanses the earth from sin with fire, He creates “a new heaven and a new earth.”<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Many believers accept the idea that the fires of hell last forever, resulting in eternal torment. Let’s look carefully at texts which describe God’s treatment of sin and sinners.<br>
“He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be PUNISHED WITH EVERLASTING DESTRUCTION and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power.”-2 Thessalonians 1:8, 9.<br>
Please note that “everlasting destruction” is not the same as “everlasting torment.” It is simply means, a destruction that lasts forever. The effect is everlasting death. Peter spoke of the day of judgment and “destruction of ungodly men” (2 Peter 3:7).<br>
According to Jesus, both “soul and body” are destroyed in hell (Matthew 10:28). In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus talked about the narrow gate “that leads to life,” and the broad road “that leads to destruction” (Matthew 7:13, 14). In John 3:16 Jesus explains that God “gave His one and only Son,” that those who believe might not “perish, but have eternal life.” Jesus contrasts two fates: everlasting life or perishing-not eternal burning. We must conclude that hell definitely has an ending; it results in the death and destruction of the wicked.<br>
Clear statements throughout Scripture tell us the wicked will be destroyed. “The wicked will be cut off” (Psalms 37:28), they “will perish” (2 Peter 2:12), “they will vanish like smoke” (Psalm 37:20). The fire will reduce them to ashes (Malachi 4:1-3). “The wages of sin is death,” not eternal life in hellfire; “the gift of God is eternal life” (Romans 6:23).<br>
The purpose of the final punishment in hellfire is to rid the universe of sin, not to preserve sin forever. It is extremely hard to imagine that the Christ who wept over the fate of stubborn Jerusalem and who forgave those who put Him to death, would be able to spend eternity watching over the agonies of the damned.<br>
Hell definitely has an ending. At the close of the 1,000 years, God rains fire down from the skies and eliminates the Devil, his angels, and the wicked who persist in holding on to their sins. “Fire” comes “down from heaven” and devours them (Revelation 20:9).<br>
According to Jesus, this fire is “unquenchable” (Matthew 3:12). No fire brigade will be able to put it out until it has done its work of complete destruction.<br>
God promises that, out of this cleansing fire, he will create “a new earth,” in which the “the past troubles will be forgotten;” and “the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more” (Isaiah 65: 16-19).<br>
What a day that will be! Every cause for heartache will have vanished. God will erase the wounds of sin from every heart, and our happiness will be complete.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
In Matthew 25:41 Jesus speaks of “the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” Does “eternal” here suggest hell is forever? Jude 7 presents Sodom and Gomorrah “as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.” Obviously those cities aren’t still burning. But the fire WAS eternal in the sense that it resulted in permanent destruction. <br>
In 2 Peter 2:6 once more we read of eternal fire. But this scripture also clearly points out that God “condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly.” The ungodly of Sodom and Gomorrah are not still in agony; they were reduced to ashes long ago. And yet the fire that burned them is “eternal” in its consequences-permanent destruction. Eternal means permanent punishment, not punishing.<br>
Because the book of Revelation uses such vivid, symbolic language, some of its passages have been misunderstood. For example, Revelation 14:11 says of the lost, “the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever.” This sounds like endless suffering. But, again, let’s let Scripture interpret Scripture.<br>
Exodus 21:6 in the KJV speaks of a servant’s having his ear drilled through as a sign that he was to serve his master “forever.” In this case “forever” would be as long as the servant’s life would last. Jonah, who spent only three days and three nights in the belly of the whale (Matthew 12:40), reports that he was there “forever” (Jonah 2:6). No doubt three days in the slimy darkness did seem like forever.<br>
So we must be careful to understand how and when Scripture uses symbolic, poetic language. The smoke ascending forever from the lake of fire is a vivid way of expressing eternal destruction. Revelation 21:8 tells us plainly that the lake which burns with fire and brimstone “is the second death.” Hell has an ending. The wicked are consumed; they are destroyed.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
In the beginning God created a perfect world. But sin came in and brought disaster, decay, and death. If you returned home some evening and found your house ransacked and wrecked, would you leave it that way forever? Of course not. You would sweep out the dirt and rubbish, clean the place from top to bottom, and throw away furniture ruined beyond repair. God will do the same. He will take care of the wreckage and pollution of sin once and for all, creating a new earth in its place. God’s purpose for having this world purified by fire is to prepare the way for a perfect world for the saved to live in.<br>
But God faces a serious problem because sin not only wrecked the physical world, it also infected people. Sin damages our relationship with Him and with each other. Humanity continues to be plagued by child abuse, terrorism, pornography, and a thousand other cancers of the soul. God must someday destroy sin, because sin is destroying people. God’s dilemma is this: how to eliminate the deadly virus of sin from the world and yet not destroy all the people infected by it? His solution was to take on the virus in His own body; He allowed the cancer of sin to destroy Him at the cross. As a result:<br>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and PURIFY US FROM ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.-1 John 1:9.<br>
God offers His solution to the sin problem freely to everyone. But the sad fact is, some insist on clinging to the disease of sin. And God will not force people to choose His way of eternal life. Those who reject His solution will finally be consumed by the disease. The real reason for hell is this:<br>
“For I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.”-Isaiah 65:12.<br>
Cut off from Jesus by their own choices, the wicked will discover that the only alternative is eternal death.<br>

Even though the Scriptures do not teach that the fire of hell results in endless suffering, it does give us a glimpse of what a terrible experience it is to be lost. The wicked are going to miss out on eternal life. What a horror it will be to realize that the joy of eternal life with God has slipped through their hands, that they’ll never, ever experience the bliss of perfect, loving relationships throughout the ages.<br>
When Christ hung on the cross with the world’s sins separating Him from the Father, He must have felt the agony of the eternally lost. As the wicked look into the black void ahead of them, they see only eternal destruction. They must die with no hope of a second resurrection. At the same time they see how they pushed Christ away time after time when He came near with overtures of love. In the end they fall to their knees and acknowledge God’s justice and His love (Philippians 2:10, 11). <br>
No wonder Bible writers urgently press on us the weight of our choices and the claims of Christ.<br>
“We urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. For he says, ‘In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.’ I tell you, NOW is the time of God’s favor, NOW is the day of salvation.”-2 Corinthians 6:1-2.<br>
I can think of no greater tragedy than someone wasting the priceless sacrifice of Jesus by choosing to be lost. The alternatives facing us are starkly clear: eternal destruction-an eternity excluded from the presence of God, or an eternal friendship with Christ that fulfills our deepest longings. Which do you choose for yourself? Why not discover your destiny in Christ today?<br>

We cringe when a child first asks, “What does it mean to die?” We shrink from talking about or even thinking about someone we love dying. Death is the common enemy of people everywhere.<br>
What are the answers to the hard questions about death? Is there life after death? Will we see our dead loved ones again?<br>

All of us at certain moments, perhaps right after the passing of a friend or loved one, have felt that emptiness in the pit of our stomachs, that lonely feeling that sweeps over us, as we catch a glimpse of the end of life.<br>
In a matter so important, so packed with emotion, where can we learn the truth about what happens when we die? Fortunately, part of Christ’s mission on earth was to “free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death” (Hebrews 2:15). And in the Bible, Jesus presents comforting messages, and answers clearly all our questions about death and a future life.<br>

To understand from the Bible the real truth about death, let’s start at the beginning and see how our Creator made us.<br>
“The LORD God formed the man [adam, Hebrew] from the DUST OF THE GROUND [adamah, Hebrew] and breathed into his nostrils THE BREATH OF LIFE, and the man became A LIVING BEING [SOUL, Hebrew].”-Genesis 2:7. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].) <br>
At Creation God fashioned Adam from “the dust of the ground.” He had a brain in his head ready to think; blood in his veins ready to flow. Then God breathed into his nostrils “the breath of life,” and Adam became “a living being” [Hebrew, “a living soul”]. Note carefully, the Bible does not say Adam received a soul; rather it says that “man became a living soul.” As God breathed into Adam, life began to flow from God. The combination of the body and “the breath of life” made Adam “a living being,” “a living soul.” So we might write the human equation like this:<br>
“Dust of Ground” + “Breath of Life” = “A living Soul”<br>
Lifeless Body + Breath from God = A Living Being<br>
Each of us has a body and a reasoning mind. As long as we continue to breathe, we will be a living being, a living soul.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                   <span class="blogsubject">3. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PERSON DIES?</span>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
At death the reverse of the creative process described in Genesis 2:7 takes place:<br>
“And the DUST returns to the ground it came from, and the SPIRIT [BREATH OF LIFE] returns to God who gave it.”-Ecclesiastes 12:7.<br>
The Bible often uses the Hebrew words for “breath” and the “spirit” interchangeably. When people die, their body becomes “dust” and the “spirit” (the “breath of life”) returns to God, its source. But what happens to the soul?<br>
“As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD,… every LIVING SOUL belongs to me…. THE SOUL WHO SINS IS THE ONE WHO WILL DIE.”-Ezekiel 18:3-4.<br>
The soul dies! It is not now immortal-it can perish.<br>
The equation derived from Genesis 2:7, when God made us, reverses itself at death. <br>
“Dust of Earth” – “Breath of Life” = “A Dead Soul”<br>
Lifeless Body – Breath from God = A Dead Being<br>
Death is the cessation of life. The body disintegrates to dust, and the breath, or spirit, goes back to God. We are a living soul in life, but in death only a corpse, a dead soul, dead being. So the dead are not conscious. When God takes back the breath of life He gave to us, our soul dies. But as we will see later in this lesson, with Christ there is hope.<br>

After death the brain disintegrates; it can’t know or remember anything. All human emotions cease at death.<br>
“Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished....”-Ecclesiastes 9:6.<br>
The dead are not conscious, so they are not aware of anything that takes place. They have absolutely no contact with the living:<br>
“For the living know that they will die, but THE DEAD KNOW NOTHING.”-Ecclesiastes 9:5.<br>
Death is like a dreamless sleep-in fact, the Bible calls death a “sleep” 54 times. Jesus taught that death is like a sleep. He said to His disciples:<br>
“’Our friend LAZARUS HAS FALLEN ASLEEP; but I am going there to wake him up.’ His disciples replied, ‘Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.’ Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. So then he told them plainly, ‘LAZARUS IS DEAD.’”-John 11:11-14.<br>
Lazarus was dead for four days before Jesus arrived. But when Jesus went to his tomb, He proved that it is easy for God to raise the dead as for us to awaken a sleeping companion. <br>
It’s a great comfort to know that our deceased loved ones are “asleep,” resting peacefully in Jesus. The tunnel of death, which we ourselves may someday pass through, is like quite, peaceful sleep.<br>

The sleep of death is not the end of the story. At the tomb, Jesus said to Martha, Lazarus’ sister:<br>
“I AM THE RESURRECTION and the life. HE WHO BELIEVES IN ME WILL LIVE, even though he dies.”-John 11:25.<br>
Those who die “in Christ” sleep in the grave-but they still have a bright future. The One who counts every hair on our heads and holds us in the palm of His hand will not forget us. We may die and return to the dust, but the record of our individuality remains clear in the mind of God. And when Jesus comes, He will awaken the righteous dead from their sleep, just like He did Lazarus.<br>
“We do not want you to be ignorant about THOSE WHO FALL ASLEEP, OR TO GRIEVE LIKE THE REST OF MEN, WHO HAVE NO HOPE…. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL RISE FIRST. After that, WE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE and are left WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. THEREFORE ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER WITH THESE WORDS.”-1 Thessalonians 4:13, 16-18.<br>
On resurrection day, the tunnel of death will seem like a brief rest. The dead are not aware of time passing. Those who have accepted Christ as their Savior, will be awakened from sleep by His wonderful voice coming down to earth.<br>
The hope of resurrection has a companion: the hope of a heavenly home where God “will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain” (Revelation 21:4). Those who love God don’t have to fear death. Beyond it lies an eternity of a fulfilling life with God. Jesus holds “the keys of death” (Revelation 1:18). Without Christ, death would be a one-way street ending in oblivion, but with Christ there is a bright, radiant hope.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
When God created Adam and Eve, they were created mortal, that is, subject to death. Had they remained obedient to God’s will they would never have died. But when they sinned, they gave up their right to life. By disobedience they became subject to death. Their sins infected the entire human race, and since all have sinned, we are all mortal, subject to death (Romans 5:12). And there is not even a hint in the Bible that the human soul can exist as a conscious entity after death.<br>
The Bible never once describes the soul as now being immortal-that is, not subject to death. The Hebrew words for “soul,” “spirit,” and “breath” occur in the Bible 1,700 times. But not once is the human soul, spirit, breath referred to as immortal. At the present time God alone possesses immortality.<br>
“God…ALONE IS IMMORTAL.”-1 Timothy 6:15, 16.<br>
Scriptures makes it clear that people in this life are mortal: subject to death. But when Jesus returns, our nature will undergo a radical change. <br>
“Listen, I tell you a mystery: WE WILL NOT ALL SLEEP, but WE WILL ALL BE CHANGED-in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, AT THE LAST TRUMPET. For the trumpet will sound, THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED imperishable, AND WE WILL BE CHANGED. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and THE MORTAL WITH IMMORTALITY.-1 Corinthians 15:51-53.<br>
As human beings, we are not now immortal. But the Christian’s assurance is that we become immortal when Jesus comes again a second time. The certainty of the promise of immortality was demonstrated when Jesus burst open His tomb and:<br>
“DESTROYED DEATH and… BROUGHT LIFE AND IMMORTALITY TO LIGHT through the gospel.”-1 Timothy 1:10.<br>
God’s perspective on human destiny is clear: eternal death for those who reject Christ and cling to their sins, or immortality as a gift when Jesus comes for those who have accepted Him as Lord and Savior.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The fears that we naturally struggle with in the face of death become especially acute when a loved one dies. The loneliness and sense of loss can be overwhelming. The only solution to the anguish caused by separation from a loved one is the comfort that only Christ gives. Remember that your loved one is asleep, and your loved ones who rest in Jesus will rise in the “resurrection of life” when Jesus comes.<br>
God is planning some wonderful reunions. Children will be returned to their ecstatic parents. Husbands and wives will melt into each other’s arms. Life’s cruel separations will be over. “Death has been swallowed up in victory” (1 Corinthians 15:54).<br>
Some feel the separation from a loved one so keenly that they try to make contact with their dead loved ones through a spiritualist medium or a New Age channeler. But the Bible specifically warns us against trying to ease the pain of death this way:<br>
“When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?”-Isaiah 8:19. <br>
Indeed, Why? The Bible clearly reveals that the dead are not conscious. The real solution to the anguish caused by separation from a loved one is the comfort that only Christ gives. Spending time communicating with Christ is the healthiest way to grow through the grieving process. Remember always, the next conscious impression that comes to those who sleep in Christ will be the sounds of the second coming of Christ to awaken the dead!<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Death robs us of almost everything. But the one thing it can’t take from us is Christ, and Christ can put everything back together again. Death will not always reign in this world. The Devil, the wicked, death, and the grave will perish in “the lake of fire” which is “the second death” (Revelation 20:14).<br>
Here are four simple suggestions for facing death unafraid:<br>
(1) Live a life of hopeful trust in Christ, and you will be prepared for death at any moment.<br>
(2) Through the power of the Holy Spirit, be obedient to Christ’s commandments, and you will be prepared for a second life in which you will never die.<br>
(3) Think of death as a short sleep from which Jesus’ voice will awaken you when He comes a second time.<br>
(4) Cherish the assurance Jesus gives us of a heavenly home with Him for all eternity.<br>
Bible truth releases a person from the fear of death because it reveals Jesus, the One whom even death could not conquer. When Jesus comes into our lives, He floods our hearts with peace:<br>
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you…. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”-John 14:27.<br>
Jesus also makes it possible for us to cope with the tragedy of losing a loved one. Jesus walked through “the valley of the shadow of death”; He knows about the dark nights we go through.<br>
‘Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that BY HIS DEATH he might destroy him who holds the power of death-that is, the devil-and FREE THOSE WHO ALL THEIR LIVES WERE HELD IN SLAVERY BY THEIR FEAR OF DEATH.”-Hebrews 2:14, 15.<br>
Dr. James Simpson, the great physician who developed anesthesia, experienced a terrible loss when his eldest child died. He grieved deeply as any parent would. But then he found his way to hope. On his beloved child’s grave he erected a marker and on it he carved these words Jesus spoke concerning His resurrection: “Nevertheless, I live.”<br>
That says it all. Personal tragedy may seem to blot out the sky sometimes; nevertheless, Jesus lives! Our hearts may be breaking; nevertheless, Jesus lives! <br>
In Christ we have hope of life after death. He is “the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25), and He promises, “Because I live, you also will live” (John 14:19). Christ is our only hope of life after death. And when Christ comes again He gives us immortality. We will never again live under the shadow of death, for we have eternal life. Have you discovered this great hope that we can cherish in our darkest moments? If you have never accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, will you do it just now?<br>

God has frequently given special messages to meet the needs of different generations: a message to help Adam and Eve after sin ruined their world, a message to the world before the cataclysm of the Flood, messages for Israel when Assyria or Babylon threatened. Jesus came with a special message for His generation, and God has sounded a special message for our day. Chapters 12 and 14 of Revelation summarize God’s special message for us today. In this DISCOVER guide and the guide that follows, we will take a look at that message.<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The life and teachings of Jesus established unity of belief and close fellowship in the apostolic church that He founded. The apostles formed an intimate relationship with the risen Christ. Paul pictured that close bond as a marriage relationship:<br>
“I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.”-2 Corinthians 11:2 (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
According to Paul, the Christian church is a pure woman, the bride of Christ, a fitting symbol of Christ’s beloved church.<br>
In the Old Testament the same metaphor is used to describe Israel, God’s chosen people. God said to Israel: “as a bride you loved me” (Jeremiah 2:2); “I am your husband” (Jeremiah 3:14).<br>
The book of Revelation also speaks of the church as a woman:<br>
“A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.”-Revelation 12:1<br>
(1) The woman is “clothed with the sun.” This suggests a church shining like the sun, because of being clothed with Christ’s glorious presence. Jesus, “the light of the world” (John 8:12), shines through the members of His church, and they in turn become “the light of the world” (Matthew 5:14).<br>
(2) The woman has “the moon under her feet.” The moon represents the reflected light of the gospel in the sacrifices and ceremonies of God’s people in the Old Testament. The moon being “under her feet” suggests that the reflected light of the gospel has been superseded by Christ’s ministry.<br>
(3) The woman has “a crown of twelve stars on her head.” Stars fittingly represent the twelve apostles, noble men whose testimony about Jesus shines brilliantly to this very day.<br>
Clearly, the description of this woman indicates that John has in mind the transition from God’s people, Israel, in the Old Testament to the Christian church of the New Testament that Jesus established. The sun, moon, and stars emphasize the light-giving ministry of the Christian church in sharing the Good News.<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The entrance of the woman sets the stage for a great drama:<br>
“She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.”-Revelation 12:2-5.<br>
                                                      <br>
Three key figures participate in this drama:<br>
                                                      <br>
(1)The woman, already identified as the God’s church.<br>
                                                      <br>
(2)The male child born to this woman “is snatched up to God and to his throne” and will someday “rule all nations.” Jesus is the only child ever born in this world who has been taken up to God’s throne and will someday rule all nations.<br>
                                                      <br>
(3)The dragon representing the Devil, or Satan.<br>
“And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. THE GREAT DRAGON was hurled down-that ancient serpent, CALLED THE DEVIL, OR SATAN, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.”-Revelation 12:7-9.<br>
The picture becomes clear once we understand the symbols. When the Devil and his angels “lost their place in heaven,” they were “hurled to the earth.” When Jesus was born in this world, the Devil tried to kill Jesus, the male child, as soon as He was born. He failed, and Jesus was “snatched up” to God’s throne.<br>
                                                      <br>
Satan then set out to annihilate the Christian church that Christ established. The apostle John, who wrote Revelation, saw glimpses of this great conflict between Christ and Satan raging on this earth. As the battle reaches a climax at Christ’s crucifixion, John hears a voice shout from heaven:<br>
“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.”-Revelation 12:10. (Compare John 12:31 and Luke 10:18.)<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus won a decisive victory over Satan at the cross. Then he confirmed the certainty of the plan of “salvation” and provided “power” for resisting the cunning of Satan. “The kingdom of God” was made secure, and the Savior’s authority” to be our High Priest and King was confirmed.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Now have come the salvation” declares that history’s crowning event has arrived. The birth of Christ, the Savior of the world, has taken place (verse 5). In spite of Satan’s fierce temptations, Jesus has lived His sinless life, died and arose the victor over sin and death (verse 10). Satan has been forever defeated (verse 7-9). The Cross is magnified in its full power.<br>
                                                      <br>
The announcement, “now has come the salvation,” interests not only John, but the entire universe:<br>
“Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.”-Revelation 12:12.<br>
All heaven celebrated Jesus’ victory. Christ destroyed any claim Satan may have once had to a place in heaven, and a defeated Satan lost forever his claim to our world.<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Before Jesus ascended to heaven He established the Christian church (symbolized by the woman). His death on the cross gave the Christian church the power to defeat Satan.<br>
“They [the Christian church] overcome him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.”-Revelation 12:11.<br>
Christ is now able to give His power, the fruit of His victory, to His church. Jesus decisively triumphed over Satan at the cross, and He now continues to triumph over Satan through His church. Three characteristics mark the triumphant church during the passing centuries of the Christian era:<br>
(1) “They overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb.” Jesus was caught up to God’s throne so He could make His blood effective in the lives of his followers. He can clear the record of our sins, save us through His shed blood (1 John 1:7), and give us power to live a healthy Christian life day by day.<br>
(2) “They did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.” “The blood of the Lamb” made them willing to die for Christ’s cause; they did not “shrink from death.” God had suffered greatly, so these Christian martyrs were also willing to suffer and die. Even children make the ultimate sacrifice. A story is told of a Christian mother who was thrown to the lions in a Roman arena because she gave her ultimate allegiance to Christ and not to the state. Her young daughter, instead of shrinking back in horror, felt a fervent devotion welling up inside. As the lions attacked her mother, she stood and cried, “I too am a Christian.” Roman officials arrested her and hurled her to the hungry beasts.<br>
(3) “They overcame him [Satan]… by the word of their testimony.” Not the words, but the word of their testimony-the testimony of their lives, their living witness to the power of Jesus and His gospel. During the darkest hours of the Christian era an army of Christians-from the early church fathers to the Protestant reformers-overcame the worst the Devil could hurl at them, simply by the dynamics witness of their lives.<br>
Revelation 12:11 pictures a victorious church filled with overcomers: apostles, martyrs, reformers, and other faithful Christians. Their kindness, faithfulness, courage, and triumph has thundered down the centuries and moved the world.<br>
Since Satan failed to destroy Jesus when He lived on earth, he now seeks to destroy the Christ who lives in His church.<br>
“When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with torrent. But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.”-Revelation 12:13-16.<br>
Just as predicted, during the Dark Ages of the Christian era, Satan sent “a river” of persecution “to sweep” the church “away with the torrent.” Satan wants to destroy Christ’s influence by wiping out His church and uses every trick his evil genius can devise. The dragon represents Satan primarily. But remember that Satan uses human institutions in his role as dragon to attack God’s people. He used the Roman king Herod in an attempt to murder the Christ child as soon as He was born. He worked through Christ’s jealous religious rivals to stalk and harass the Savior, and finally secure His execution on the cross. But Satan’s apparent victory turned into Christ’s greatest triumph.<br>
Furious over his defeat at the Cross, Satan turned his wrath against the church that Jesus established. During the decades after Christ’s crucifixion, thousand met their death in the Roman Colosseum, city squares, dungeons, and desert hideaways.<br>
At first secular authorities initiated this persecution. But after the death of the apostles a gradual change crept into the church. During the second, third, and fourth centuries, many in the church began to modify the truths Christ and His apostles had taught. Some apostate leaders even began to persecute those Christians who insisted on the purity of New Testament beliefs. <br>
Scholars estimate that about 50 million of the faithful perished. In an effort to drown out the church and destroy it, the Devil sent “a river” of persecution “to sweep her [the church] away with the torrent.” But the earth helped the woman by… swallowing the river” of persecution and false doctrine.<br>
During these medieval persecutions, the true church withdrew from the apostate leadership and took refuge in “the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days” (verse 6). This prediction was fulfilled during the 1260 years of persecution from A.D. 538 to 1798 (a day often stands for a year in symbolic Bible prophecy, see Ezekiel 4:6).<br>
During these dark centuries, faithful Bible-believing Christians found refuge wherever they could; for example, in the Waldensian valleys of western Italy and eastern France, and in the Celtic church of the British Isles.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
This brings us to our day-to the true church of Christ since 1798. As might be expected, the Dragon is still angry with God’s people. The great unseen war continues. In fact, Satan makes his greatest attack on the church just before Jesus comes.<br>
“Then the dragon [the devil] was enraged at the woman [God’s church] and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring-those who obey God’s commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.”-Revelation 12:17.<br>
This prophecy focuses on our day. Satan is enraged; he wages war on “the rest of” the woman’s “offspring”-God’s present-day people. Notice their identifying marks:<br>
                                                      <br>
(1) These last-day believers “hold to the testimony of Jesus.” Clinging faithfully to the pure doctrines of the Word of God, they testify for Jesus through dynamic Christian living.<br>
                                                      <br>
(2) These last-day Christians are a people of prophecy. Receiving “the testimony of Jesus Christ” enabled John to write the book of Revelation (Revelation 1:1-3). The final group of believers receive a similar gift: direct testimonies from God through an earthly messenger. Their gift of prophecy focuses on God’s revelation of their mission and their final destiny.<br>
                                                      <br>
(3) These last-day Christians are also identified as “those who obey God’s commandments.” They not only defend the integrity of the Ten Commandments, they also obey them. God’s love in their hearts produces joyful obedience (Romans 5:5; 13:8-10).<br>
                                                      <br>
These last-day Christians follow the example of Christ and the early church in obeying the commandments of God. This greatly provokes the Dragon-the Devil. And he wages war with “the rest of “ the woman’s “offspring” because they bear witness that love for God produces obedient disciples. As Jesus charged:<br>
“If you love me, you will obey what I command.”-John 14:15.<br>
The lives of these last-day Christians show that it’s possible to love God with all our hearts and our fellow human beings as ourselves. According to Jesus, these qualities, love for God and love for people, sum up God’s Ten Commandments (Matthew 22: 35-40).<br>
                                                      <br>
The fourth of those commandments asks us to observe Saturday, the seventh day of the week, as the Sabbath. Since a love for Jesus has imbedded all ten of the commandments in their hearts, these last-day Christians are Sabbath-keepers.<br>
The Sabbath is at the heart of God’s final message to His people in Revelation, chapters 12, and 14:6-15. All the resources of heaven are arrayed behind the last-day Christians described in these chapters. A living Savior is their constant companion, and the Holy Spirit works to “strengthen them with power in the inner man.” The promise is sure. They will overcome Satan “by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony” (Revelation 12:11).<br>
                                                      <br>
Do you wish to be one of these last-day Christians who “obey God’s commandments” and “hold to the testimony of Jesus”? Why not make that decision just now?<br>

The wages of sin is death. But God, who alone is immortal, will grant eternal life to His redeemed. Until that day death is an unconscious state for all people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected righteous and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up to meet their Lord. The second resurrection, the resurrection of the unrighteous, will take place a thousand years later. (Job 19:25-27; Ps. 146:3, 4; Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10; Dan. 12:2, 13; Isa. 25:8; John 5:28, 29; 11:11-14; Rom. 6:23; 16; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; Col. 3:4; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 20:1-10.)<br>
