  <h2>Lesson 1 - Belief in the Existence of God</h2>
  <p></p>
            
  <h3>1. The Foundation of Faith</h3>
  <p>
    Belief in God's existence is the <strong>primary truth</strong> that underpins all religious faith and knowledge.
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 11:6 (RSV):</strong> “And without faith it is impossible to please him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.”
  </p>
  <p>
    This belief is also the <strong>foundation of wisdom</strong>, as taught in:
    <br>
    <strong>Proverbs 1:7:</strong> “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. A Revealed Truth</h3>
  <p>
    The existence of God is not something that the Bible sets out to prove philosophically. Rather, it is presented as a revealed and accepted truth.
    <br>
    There are no arguments by Jesus Christ to persuade people of God's existence; instead, Scripture assumes and teaches that God is real from the very beginning.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:1:</strong> “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. Considerations That Support Belief in God</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>a. God is revealed in the Scriptures:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Timothy 3:16:</strong> “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>b. The material universe and life:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 19:1:</strong> “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>c. Universal conviction of a Supreme Being:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Romans 1:19-20:</strong> “For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes…have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>d. Universal desire to worship:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Acts 17:22-23:</strong> Paul observed that men naturally seek to worship, even if ignorantly—evident in the altar “To the unknown god.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>e. Sense of right and wrong:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Romans 2:14-15:</strong> “They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness...”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>f. Jesus Christ’s faith in God:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>John 11:41-42:</strong> Jesus prayed, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me...”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>g. Fulfilled prophecies:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 46:9-10:</strong> “I am God, and there is no other... declaring the end from the beginning...”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Personal Experience as Evidence</h3>
  <p>
    While external evidences are compelling, the <strong>most conclusive evidence</strong> of God's existence is found in personal relationship and testimony.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Jesus Christ:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>John 7:29:</strong> “I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.”
      <br>
      <strong>John 10:15:</strong> “Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father...”
      <br>
      <strong>John 17:25:</strong> “O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you...”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Jeremiah:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Jeremiah 10:10:</strong> “But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Job:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Job 19:25:</strong> “For I know that my Redeemer lives...”
      <br>
      <strong>Job 42:5:</strong> “I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Paul:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>2 Timothy 1:12:</strong> “...I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed...”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>David:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 34:10:</strong> “...those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.”
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 42:2:</strong> “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God...”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Faith in God is both a rational and spiritual reality. While there are numerous evidences in creation and Scripture, the heart of true belief lies in personal encounter and relationship with God.
  </p>
            
            <!--
The Scriptures: Lesson 1 – Belief in the Existence of God
            
Belief in the existence of God is the foundational truth upon which all religious faith and knowledge are built. This truth is not just a theological concept but the very starting point of a relationship with God. As the book of Hebrews reminds us in chapter 11, verse 6, “And without faith it is impossible to please Him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him.” In the same spirit, Proverbs 1:7 teaches us that “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” This shows that recognizing God is not just a matter of faith but the first step toward true understanding.
The Bible does not attempt to prove God's existence through philosophical arguments. Instead, it presents God's existence as a revealed truth—something accepted and declared from the very beginning. Jesus never tried to convince people that God is real through debate; rather, He assumed and affirmed God's presence. This is clear from the opening line of Scripture: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). God's existence is not something to be debated but something to be embraced.
Several considerations help support and affirm our belief in God. First, God reveals Himself through the Scriptures. As 2 Timothy 3:16 states, “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.” Next, the natural world bears testimony to His power and creativity. Psalm 19:1 says, “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork.”
There is also a universal conviction in the human heart that there is a higher being. Romans 1:19-20 explains that what can be known about God is plain to all, for His invisible attributes have been clearly perceived through creation. Additionally, across cultures and time, people have demonstrated a natural desire to worship. Paul observed this in Acts 17:22-23 when he spoke about the altar inscribed “To the unknown god,” acknowledging that people instinctively seek a divine presence.
Another strong testimony to God's reality is our sense of right and wrong—our conscience. Romans 2:14-15 tells us that the law is written on our hearts, and our conscience bears witness to it. Even Jesus Himself expressed unwavering faith in God. In John 11:41-42, Jesus prayed with confidence, saying, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me.” Furthermore, fulfilled prophecies throughout the Bible serve as evidence of God's sovereignty and divine knowledge. In Isaiah 46:9-10, God declares, “I am God, and there is no other... declaring the end from the beginning.”
Beyond these external evidences, perhaps the most powerful proof of God’s existence lies in personal experience. Many figures in Scripture spoke of their deep, personal knowledge of God. Jesus Himself said in John 7:29, “I know Him, for I come from Him, and He sent me.” He continued in John 10:15, “Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father.” In His prayer in John 17:25, Jesus said, “O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you.”
Jeremiah affirmed this truth when he said, “But the Lord is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King” (Jeremiah 10:10). Job, in the depth of his suffering, declared, “I know that my Redeemer lives” (Job 19:25), and later said, “I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you” (Job 42:5). Paul also testified in 2 Timothy 1:12, saying, “I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed.” And David, the psalmist, expressed his longing and confidence in God with words like, “Those who seek the Lord lack no good thing” (Psalm 34:10) and “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God” (Psalm 42:2).
In conclusion, faith in God is both a rational and spiritual reality. While the world around us and the Word of God provide ample evidence of His existence, the heart of true belief is found in personal encounter and relationship with the living God.

  <h2>Lesson 2 - How God Has Revealed Himself</h2>
  <p></p>
            
  <h3>1. God Has Spoken to Humanity</h3>
  <p>
    The foundational truth of our faith is that <strong>God has revealed Himself to mankind</strong>. We believe because He has chosen to make Himself known.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Hebrews 1:1 (RSV):</strong> “In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets.”
  </p>
  <p>
    God’s self-revelation is given through His Word, and this is meant for our study and understanding. However, there are limits:
    <br>
    <em>“The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate...The Omniscient One is above discussion.”</em> — <strong>Ministry of Healing, p. 429</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>2. God Revealed in Nature</h3>
  <p>
    Nature itself is a testimony to God’s presence, power, and glory.
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 19:1-4:</strong>
    <br>
    “The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
    <br>
    Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge.
    <br>
    There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard;
    <br>
    yet their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The beauty, order, and complexity of the universe reflect the nature of its Creator.
  </p>

  <h3>3. God Revealed in History</h3>
  <p>
    The hand of God is evident in the unfolding of history. From the calling of Abraham to the exodus from Egypt, and through the rise and fall of nations, God's providence guides events.
    <br>
    <strong>Deuteronomy 4:32-34:</strong> “Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?...Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another...by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm...?”
  </p>

  <h3>4. God Revealed in Human Lives</h3>
  <p>
    God reveals Himself through the transformed lives of individuals. The testimonies of those who walk with Him serve as living evidence of His reality and love.
    <br>
    <strong>Galatians 2:20:</strong> “It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me...”
    <br>
    <strong>2 Corinthians 5:17:</strong> “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”
  </p>

  <h3>5. God Revealed Through the Prophets</h3>
  <p>
    God has consistently chosen human messengers to communicate His will and plans.
    <br>
    <strong>Amos 3:7 (Moffatt):</strong> “The Lord Eternal never does anything without telling His servants the prophets.”
    <br>
    The prophetic voice has been a vital channel of divine revelation throughout Scripture.
  </p>

  <h3>6. God Fully Revealed in Jesus Christ</h3>
  <p>
    The clearest and fullest revelation of God is found in His Son, Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <strong>John 1:18 (Moffatt):</strong> “No one has ever seen God; the divine One, who is in the bosom of the Father—he has unfolded Him.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>“All that man needs to know or can know of God has been revealed in the life and character of His Son.”</em> — <strong>Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 8, p. 286</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus is the living expression of God's nature and love. He declared:
    <br>
    <strong>John 14:9:</strong> “He who has seen Me has seen the Father.”
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion and Notes</h3>
  <p>
    All of these revelations—whether through nature, history, human experience, prophecy, or Jesus Christ—are interpreted and understood through the lens of the Bible. It is the inspired record that makes these revelations accessible and meaningful to us today.
  </p>
            <!--
Lesson 2 – How God Has Revealed Himself
            
The foundation of our faith is the truth that God has spoken to humanity. We believe in God because He has chosen to reveal Himself to us. Hebrews 1:1 tells us that, "In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets." This means God has always made Himself known throughout history. He communicates with us, and He does so through His Word—the Scriptures. While we are encouraged to study what God has revealed, we must also acknowledge our limitations. The book Ministry of Healing reminds us that God's self-revelation is for our understanding, but beyond what He has shown, we are not to try to go further, for the Omniscient One is beyond full human comprehension.
God has also revealed Himself through nature. The beauty, order, and complexity of the natural world point clearly to a Creator. Psalm 19:1–4 proclaims that “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.” Even though nature doesn’t speak in words, its message about God’s greatness and presence reaches the ends of the earth. Every sunrise, every star, every tree—all of creation silently testifies to the power and majesty of God.
In addition to nature, history itself bears witness to God. His hand can be seen in the rise and fall of nations, in the calling of Abraham, and in the miraculous exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. Deuteronomy 4:32–34 asks whether anything so great has ever happened, highlighting God’s powerful actions in guiding His people through history. These events aren’t just stories—they're evidence of God at work in the real world.
Furthermore, God reveals Himself in transformed human lives. People who walk with God become living testimonies of His presence and love. As Paul wrote in Galatians 2:20, “It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.” And in 2 Corinthians 5:17, we are reminded that anyone who is in Christ is a new creation. Changed lives speak volumes about God's ability to renew, heal, and guide.
God has also spoken through the prophets. Throughout Scripture, He chose men and women to be His messengers. Amos 3:7 declares, “The Lord Eternal never does anything without telling His servants the prophets.” These prophetic voices have been crucial in revealing God’s plans and character across generations. The words of the prophets serve as a bridge between the divine and the human.
Finally, and most fully, God has revealed Himself through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus is the clearest picture we have of who God is. John 1:18 says, “No one has ever seen God; the divine One, who is in the bosom of the Father—he has unfolded Him.” The life and teachings of Jesus show us God’s character, His compassion, and His purpose. Testimonies for the Church states, “All that man needs to know or can know of God has been revealed in the life and character of His Son.” Jesus Himself said in John 14:9, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father.” In Jesus, we meet God face to face.
In conclusion, God reveals Himself in many ways—through nature, history, changed lives, prophets, and most powerfully, through Jesus Christ. But all of these revelations are understood through the Bible. The Scriptures are the inspired guide that help us interpret and truly grasp these manifestations of God. They make God’s voice clear to us today.

  <h2>Lesson 3 - The Written Word</h2>
  <p></p>
            
  <h3>1. The Scriptures as Divine Revelation</h3>
  <p>
    The Scriptures are the special revelations of divine truth given to humanity by God through prophets and ultimately through His Son, Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 1:1-2 (KJV):</strong> "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son..."
  </p>
  <p>
    Without the Scriptures, we would not know the teachings of the prophets or the details of Christ’s life and ministry. Therefore, the Bible serves as the <strong>written record</strong> of God's communication with humanity.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Contents of the Scriptures</h3>
  <p>
    The term "Scriptures" comes from the Latin <em>scriptura</em> and Greek <em>graphai</em>, both meaning "writings." The Bible is a collection of <strong>66 books</strong>—a library of divine wisdom and revelation.
    <br>
    <strong>2 Timothy 3:16 (KJV):</strong> "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."
  </p>
  <p>
    The word "Bible" itself is derived from the Greek <em>biblos</em>, meaning "book."
  </p>

  <h3>3. Their Date of Composition</h3>
  <p>
    The earliest biblical writer was <strong>Moses</strong>, writing around 1,500 B.C. The Old Testament’s 39 books were written over a period of about 1,000 years. 
    <br>
    The 27 books of the New Testament were completed before the end of the first century A.D., with the last being the book of Revelation by the apostle John around A.D. 95.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Revelation 1:1 (KJV):</strong> "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass..."
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the full writing of the Bible spanned approximately <strong>1,600 years</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Their Authorship</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible was written by about <strong>35 different authors</strong>, including kings, prophets, fishermen, shepherds, and scholars. They wrote under divine inspiration, often drawing upon documents and traditions passed down through generations.
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 1:21 (KJV):</strong> "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."
  </p>

  <h3>5. Their Arrangement</h3>
  <p>
    The Hebrew Bible in Jesus’ time had a different structure than the English Bible. It was arranged into three main divisions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Law:</strong> Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy</li>
    <li><strong>The Prophets:</strong> Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, The Twelve (Minor Prophets)</li>
    <li><strong>The Writings:</strong> Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In our English Bibles, the arrangement is primarily literary:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Old Testament:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Law: Genesis to Deuteronomy</li>
        <li>Poetry: Job to Song of Solomon</li>
        <li>Prophecy: Isaiah to Malachi</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>New Testament:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>History: Matthew to Acts</li>
        <li>Letters: Romans to Jude</li>
        <li>Prophecy: Revelation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Luke 24:44 (KJV):</strong> Jesus Himself affirmed this threefold division: "These are the words which I spake unto you... that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me."
  </p>

  <h3>6. Their Language</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>Old Testament</strong> was written primarily in Hebrew, with parts in Aramaic (e.g., portions of Daniel and Ezra).
    <br>
    The <strong>New Testament</strong> was written in Greek, the common language of the Eastern Mediterranean world in the first century.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Bible was first translated into English by <strong>John Wycliffe</strong> between 1382 and 1388.
    <br>
    The most influential English translation is the <strong>King James Version (Authorized Version)</strong>, completed in 1611.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Psalm 119:105 (KJV):</strong> “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible is not just an ancient book; it is God’s message to mankind, preserved through generations, languages, and cultures. 
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 15:4 (KJV):</strong> “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.”
  </p>
            
            <!--
Lesson 3 - The Written Word

The Scriptures are God’s special revelation to humanity. They were given through the prophets in the past and ultimately through His Son, Jesus Christ. Hebrews chapter 1, verses 1 and 2, reminds us that God spoke in many ways through the prophets, but in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son. Without the Scriptures, we would not have access to the teachings of the prophets or the life and ministry of Christ. The Bible stands as the written record of God’s communication with mankind.
The word "Scriptures" comes from Latin and Greek words meaning "writings." The Bible is made up of 66 books—a divine library filled with wisdom and truth. In 2 Timothy 3:16, we’re told that all Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, correcting, and training in righteousness. The word "Bible" itself comes from the Greek word biblos, meaning "book."
The Bible was written over a long period of time. Moses was the first known writer, around 1500 B.C., and he began the writing of the Old Testament. These 39 books were written over approximately 1,000 years. The New Testament, consisting of 27 books, was completed before the end of the first century A.D., with Revelation being the last, written by the apostle John around A.D. 95. This means the Bible was written over a span of about 1,600 years. Revelation chapter 1, verse 1, tells us that the book was given to reveal what must soon come to pass.
About 35 different people wrote the Bible, including kings, prophets, fishermen, shepherds, and scholars. Though their backgrounds were diverse, they were all inspired by God’s Spirit. As 2 Peter 1:21 says, prophecy didn’t come by the will of man, but by holy men of God who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
The structure of the Bible also developed over time. The Hebrew Bible, used in Jesus’ day, had three main divisions: the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. This included books like Genesis, Isaiah, Psalms, and Chronicles. In English Bibles today, the arrangement is more literary. The Old Testament is grouped into Law, Poetry, and Prophecy, while the New Testament includes History, Letters, and Prophecy. Jesus Himself affirmed this threefold division in Luke 24:44, saying everything written in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.
The Bible was originally written in different languages. The Old Testament was primarily in Hebrew, with some sections in Aramaic. The New Testament was written in Greek, which was widely spoken in the first-century Eastern Mediterranean world. The first English translation was done by John Wycliffe between 1382 and 1388. The most famous and influential English version is the King James Version, completed in 1611. Psalm 119:105 beautifully describes the role of Scripture in our lives: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”
In conclusion, the Bible is more than an ancient manuscript—it is God’s enduring message to humanity. It has been preserved through generations, across languages and cultures, to offer guidance, hope, and truth. As Romans 15:4 tells us, the things written in Scripture were written for our learning, so that through patience and encouragement, we might have hope.

  <h2>Lesson 4 - The Reliability of the Bible</h2>
  <p></p>
            
  <h3>1. The Claim of Scripture</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible is not a mere collection of human opinions; it declares itself as a message from God.
    <br>
    <strong>2 Timothy 3:16-17:</strong> “All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 1:21:</strong> “For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Attitude of Christ and the Apostles Toward Scripture</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus and His apostles treated the Scriptures with reverence and accepted them as trustworthy truth.
    <br>
    <strong>John 10:35 (Goodspeed's Translation):</strong> “The Scripture cannot be set aside.”
    <br>
    <strong>John 6:63:</strong> “The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.”
    <br>
    <em>“Jesus taught the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority.” (The Desire of Ages, p. 253)</em>
  </p>

  <h3>3. Scripture Claims Substantiated</h3>
  <p>
    Though the Bible doesn’t argue extensively for its divine origin, it provides strong evidence accessible to sincere seekers.
  </p>

  <h4>a. The Evidence of Prophecy</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Isaiah 46:9-10:</strong> “...I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me. I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come...”
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The Destiny of Nations – Jeremiah 29:10-14:</strong><br>

Lesson 4 – The Reliability of the Bible
            
The Bible is not just a collection of human ideas or ancient writings. It claims to be the very Word of God. According to 2 Timothy 3:16-17, "All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work." Similarly, 2 Peter 1:21 tells us that prophecy never came by human will, but that prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
Jesus Christ and His apostles treated Scripture with utmost reverence and accepted it as absolute truth. In John 10:35, we read, “The Scripture cannot be set aside.” Jesus also said in John 6:63, “The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.” Ellen White, in The Desire of Ages, wrote, “Jesus taught the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority.”
The Bible doesn’t set out to prove its divine origin through argument, but it offers powerful evidence for those who sincerely seek the truth. One of the strongest evidences of the Bible’s reliability is prophecy.
For example, in Isaiah 46:9-10, God declares, “I am God, and there is no other... declaring the end from the beginning.” The Bible foretells significant historical events, such as the destiny of nations. In Jeremiah 29:10-14, God predicted Israel’s return from Babylon after seventy years of captivity. Political events are also foretold, like in Daniel 2, where Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about successive world empires.
Natural events were also prophesied. In Matthew 24:29, Jesus spoke of a time when the sun would be darkened, the moon would not give its light, and stars would fall from the sky. Prophecies about the future of cities were fulfilled as well. Isaiah and Ezekiel predicted the destruction of Babylon and Tyre centuries before it happened.
The Bible also outlines the experiences of the Church, such as persecution and victory, as seen in Revelation 12 and 2 Thessalonians 2. Most importantly, messianic prophecies in John 5:39 and Luke 24 show how the Old Testament foretold the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
Beyond prophecy, the personal experiences of believers confirm the Bible’s power. In 1 Peter 1:23, we’re told that we are born again through the living and enduring word of God. The Bible has transformed countless lives, bringing hope, peace, and a new beginning.
The accuracy of the Bible is also affirmed by archaeology. Historical findings have confirmed places, events, and people mentioned in the Bible. Discoveries such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the ancient city of Jericho, and the remains of Babylon support the Bible’s historical record. You can explore more about these discoveries through trusted sources like Ministry Magazine on the General Conference website.
In conclusion, the Bible’s reliability is confirmed by fulfilled prophecy, personal transformation, archaeological evidence, and the trust placed in it by Jesus and the apostles. It continues to guide, correct, and inspire believers even today.

  <h2>Lesson 5 - How to Study the Bible</h2>
  <p></p>
            
  <h3>1. The Importance of Bible Study</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible is God’s revelation and guide for life. Studying it is of supreme importance because it reveals His will.
    <br>
    <strong>Joshua 1:1-2, 6-8:</strong> God instructs Joshua to obey the law given through Moses, saying:
    <br>
    <em>“This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night... For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.”</em> (Joshua 1:8)
  </p>
  <p>
    As Ellen G. White noted in *Steps to Christ*, p. 90: 
    <br>
    <em>“There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study of the Scriptures... If God’s word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times.”</em>
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Primary Requisite</h3>
  <p>
    A spiritual mindset is essential in studying the Bible.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 2:7-10, 13-14:</strong> 
    <em>“The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God... they are spiritually discerned.”</em>
    <br>
    Therefore, several spiritual qualities are necessary:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>a. A reverent attitude:</strong> 
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 89:6-7:</strong> “...God is greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones.”
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 119:161:</strong> “My heart stands in awe of your words.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>b. A humble mind:</strong> 
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 57:15:</strong> “I dwell... with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit.”
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 143:10:</strong> “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God!”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>c. A prayerful spirit:</strong> 
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 119:18:</strong> “Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>d. A receptive heart:</strong> 
      <br>
      <strong>Jeremiah 15:16:</strong> “Your words were found, and I ate them...”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>e. An obedient will:</strong> 
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 119:11:</strong> “I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.”
      <br>
      <strong>John 7:17:</strong> “If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God...”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Guiding Principles in Bible Study</h3>
  <p>
    Proper interpretation of Scripture requires attention to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>a. Correct reading of the text</strong></li>
    <li><strong>b. Grammatical construction</strong></li>
    <li><strong>c. Word meanings</strong></li>
    <li><strong>d. The context</strong></li>
    <li><strong>e. The historical setting</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Bible is unified, written under inspiration of one Spirit. Therefore, comparing scripture with scripture enhances understanding.
    <br>
    <strong>Luke 24:27:</strong> “And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.”
    <br>
    <strong>Luke 24:44:</strong> “Everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Benefits of Bible Study</h3>
  <p>
    Bible study offers many spiritual benefits:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hebrews 5:13-14:</strong> It sharpens our moral discernment: 
      <em>“...trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.”</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>John 5:39:</strong> “You search the Scriptures... it is they that bear witness about me.”
    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
      <strong>Psalm 119:11:</strong> “I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>1 Peter 2:2:</strong> “Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>1 Peter 1:23:</strong> “...you have been born again... through the living and abiding word of God.”

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The study of Scripture is not merely an intellectual exercise but a spiritual discipline. It sanctifies, enlightens, strengthens, and transforms. To study the Bible rightly is to grow in both knowledge and godliness, drawing nearer to Christ who is the living Word.
  </p>

            
            <!--
Lesson 5: How to Study the Bible

Let’s begin with the importance of studying the Bible. The Bible is God’s revelation to humanity. It is our ultimate guide for life and godliness. Studying it is essential because it helps us understand God's will and walk in His ways. In Joshua 1, God told Joshua to meditate on the Book of the Law day and night. He promised that doing so would lead to prosperity and success. As Joshua 1:8 says, “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night… For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.”
Ellen G. White also emphasized the power of Bible study in Steps to Christ, page 90. She wrote, “There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study of the Scriptures.” She said that if God’s word were studied as it should be, people would develop a broad mind, a noble character, and a steady sense of purpose rarely seen in these times.
Now, let’s consider the primary requirement for effective Bible study. It is not just about reading words on a page—it requires a spiritual mindset. First Corinthians chapter 2 tells us that spiritual truths are spiritually discerned. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God because they are foolish to him. Therefore, we must approach Scripture with certain spiritual qualities.
First, we need a reverent attitude. Psalm 89 reminds us that God is greatly to be feared, and Psalm 119 says, “My heart stands in awe of your words.”
Second, we must have a humble mind. Isaiah 57 tells us that God dwells with those who are lowly in spirit, and Psalm 143 says, “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God!”
Third, we need a prayerful spirit. In Psalm 119, David prays, “Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.”
Fourth, we need a receptive heart. In Jeremiah 15, the prophet says, “Your words were found, and I ate them.”
Lastly, we must have an obedient will. Psalm 119 says, “I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you,” and Jesus says in John 7, “If anyone’s will is to do God’s will, he will know whether the teaching is from God.”
When it comes to guiding principles for Bible study, we must read the text correctly, consider the grammar and the meanings of words, pay attention to the context, and understand the historical setting. The Bible is a unified book, written under the inspiration of one Spirit. That’s why comparing scripture with scripture is so important. In Luke chapter 24, Jesus explained the Scriptures beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, showing how they pointed to Him. He said, “Everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”
There are many benefits to Bible study. It sharpens our spiritual and moral discernment, as seen in Hebrews chapter 5. Jesus said in John 5:39, “You search the Scriptures… it is they that bear witness about me.” Paul reminded Timothy in 2 Timothy 3 that the Scriptures can make one wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. He added that all Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, correcting, and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
John 17 says, “Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.” Ephesians 6 describes God’s word as the sword of the Spirit, part of the armor of God. Psalm 119 tells us, “I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.” Peter, in his letters, encourages us to long for God’s word like newborn babies crave milk, because it helps us grow in salvation. He also says that we are born again through the living and abiding word of God, and that the word is like a lamp shining in a dark place.
In closing, remember that Bible study is not just an intellectual activity. It is a spiritual discipline. It sanctifies us, enlightens us, strengthens us, and transforms us. To study the Bible rightly is to grow in both knowledge and godliness. Most importantly, it brings us closer to Jesus Christ, who is the living Word.
