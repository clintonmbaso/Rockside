                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Scripture uses various expressions to describe the church, such as “the 
church of God” (Acts 20:28), “the body of Christ” (Eph. 4:12), and “the 
church of the living God” (1 Tim. 3:15).
            
To belong to the church of God is a unique and soul-satisfying privilege. 
It is God’s purpose to gather out a people from the far corners of the earth to 
bind them into one body, the body of Christ, of which He is the living head. 
All who are children of God in Christ Jesus are members of this body, and in 
this relationship they may enjoy fellowship with each other and fellowship 
also with their Lord.
            
The Bible uses the word church in at least two senses: a general sense 
applying to the church in all the world (Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 12:28) and a 
particular sense applying to the church in a city or a province, such as to those
at Rome (Rom. 1:6, 7), Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and Thessalonica (1 Thess. 1:1) 
and of Galatia (1 Cor. 16:1), Asia (1 Cor. 16:19), and Syria and Cilicia (Acts 
15:41).
            
Christ, being the head of the church and its living Lord, has a deep love 
for the members of His body. In the church He is to be glorified (Eph. 3:21).
Through the church He will reveal the “manifold wisdom of God” (Eph. 
3:10). Day by day He nourishes the church (Eph. 5:29), and His longing 
desire is to make of it “a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any
such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish” (Eph. 5:27)

                <h2>No Wall of Partition</h2>
                <p>Christ sought by precept and example to teach the truth that with God 
there was to be no dividing wall between Israel and other nations
(John 4:4-42; 10:16; Luke 9:51-56; Matt. 15:21-28). The apostle Paul writes, 
“The Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His 
promise in Christ through the gospel” (Eph. 3:6).
Nor is there to be among Christ’s followers any preference of caste or 
nationality or race or color, for all are of one blood. The elect of God are a 
universal body, a new humanity, saved by the blood of Christ, which is 
available to all. “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor 
free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” 
(Gal. 3:28).
“Christ came to this earth with a message of mercy and forgiveness. He 
laid the foundation for a religion by which Jew and Gentile, black and white, 
free and bond, are linked together in one common brotherhood, recognized 
as equal in the sight of God. The Savior has a boundless love for every human 
being.”—7T 225.
“No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste is recognized by 
God. He is the Maker of all mankind. All men are of one family by creation, 
and all are one through redemption. Christ came to demolish every wall of 
partition, to throw open every compartment of the temple, that every soul 
may have free access to God. . . . In Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, 
bond nor free. All are brought nigh by His precious blood.”— COL 386.

                <h2>Supreme Object of Christ’s Regard</h2>
<p>
Those in Christ’s service who are called to leadership are to “take care 
of the church” (1 Tim. 3:5), to “shepherd the church of God” (Acts 20:28), 
and to show “concern for all the churches” (2 Cor. 11:28). (See pp. 32-36.)
“I testify to my brethren and sisters that the church of Christ, enfeebled 
and defective as it may be, is the only object on earth on which He bestows 
His supreme regard. While He extends to all the world His invitation to come 
to Him and be saved, He commissions His angels to render divine help to 
every soul that cometh to Him in repentance and contrition, and He comes
personally by His Holy Spirit into the midst of His church.”— TM 15.
            
As the bride of Christ and the supreme object of His regard, the church 
is expected in all its functions to represent the order and the character of the 
divine.
            
“At this time the church is to put on her beautiful garments—‘Christ our 
righteousness.’ There are clear, decided distinctions to be restored and 
exemplified to the world in holding aloft the commandments of God and the 
faith of Jesus. The beauty of holiness is to appear in its native luster in 
contrast with the deformity and darkness of the disloyal, those who have 
revolted from the law of God. Thus we acknowledge God, and recognize His 
law, the foundation of His government in heaven and throughout His earthly 
dominions. His authority should be kept distinct and plain before the world, 
and no laws are to be acknowledged that come in collision with the laws of 
Jehovah. If in defiance of God’s arrangements the world be allowed to 
influence our decisions or our actions, the purpose of God is defeated.
            
However specious the pretext, if the church waver here, there is written
against her in the books of heaven a betrayal of the most sacred trusts, and 
treachery to the kingdom of Christ. The church is firmly and decidedly to 
hold her principles before the whole heavenly universe and the kingdoms of 
the world; steadfast fidelity in maintaining the honor and sacredness of the 
law of God will attract the notice and admiration of even the world, and many 
will, by the good works which they shall behold, be led to glorify our Father 
in heaven.”—TM 16, 17.
            
The apostle Peter writes, “But you are a chosen generation, a royal 
priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the 
praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 
Peter 2:9).

                <h2>Complete in Christ</h2>
<p>
“The Lord has provided His church with capabilities and blessings, that 
they may present to the world an image of His own sufficiency, and that His 
church may be complete in Him, a continual representation of another, even 
the eternal world, of laws that are higher than earthly laws. His church is to 
be a temple built after the divine similitude, and the angelic architect has 
brought his golden measuring rod from heaven, that every stone may be 
hewed and squared by the divine measurement and polished to shine as an 
emblem of heaven, radiating in all directions the bright, clear beams of the 
Sun of Righteousness. . . .
            
“The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts through the 
exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is effecting transformations 
so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting, with all his 
confederacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government, 
stands viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and 
delusions. They are to him an incomprehensible mystery. The angels of God, 
seraphim and cherubim, the powers commissioned to cooperate with human 
agencies, look on with astonishment and joy that fallen men, once children 
of wrath, are through the training of Christ developing characters after the 
divine similitude, to be sons and daughters of God, to act an important part 
in the occupations and pleasures of heaven.
            
“To His church, Christ has given ample facilities, that He may receive a
large revenue of glory from His redeemed, purchased possession. The church, 
being endowed with the righteousness of Christ, is His depository, in which 
the wealth of His mercy, His love, His grace, is to appear in full and final 
display. . . .
            
“In their untainted purity and spotless perfection, Christ looks upon His
people as the reward of all His suffering, His humiliation, and His love, and 
the supplement of His glory—Christ, the great center from which radiates all 
glory. ‘Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the 
Lamb.’ ”—TM 17-19.
            
The church is committed to the foregoing principles of the spiritual unity 
of Christ’s church. By the peace and power which Christ’s righteousness 
brings, the church pledges to conquer every barrier that sin has erected 
between human beings.
