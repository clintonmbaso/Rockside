                <h2>Organizing a Church</h2>
                <p>A church is organized by an ordained pastor on the recommendation of 
the conference executive committee. (For the procedure for organizing a 
company, see pp. 38-40.) Since so much is involved in the organization of a 
church, the local conference president should be invited to be present.
When a company of baptized believers is prepared to assume the 
responsibilities of an organized church, it must consult with the conference 
president and obtain approval from the conference executive committee prior 
to seeking a date for the organization to take place.
When the baptized believers assemble on the agreed-upon date, the 
individual officiating should first present a brief review of the Fundamental 
Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists.
Then the one presiding should make a call asking all who are in 
agreement with these principles and who desire to unite in church fellowship 
to come forward. The name of each person should be recorded. If any are 
already members of the conference church or another congregation, the one 
officiating should present the letters of transfers they have secured. Those 
transferring form the nucleus of the congregation.
If, however, there are no transferring members, then three members 
(preferably established Sabbathkeepers among those present) should be 
selected as a nucleus. They may be asked these questions: Do you accept 
Christ as your personal Savior? Are you in full harmony with the principles 
of faith that have just been presented? Have you been baptized by immersion? 
Are you in regular standing and enjoying one another’s confidence?
If they answer these questions in the affirmative, the three are declared 
the nucleus of the new church. Then one after another the names that were 
recorded are called, each person is asked the questions listed in the preceding 
paragraph, and the presiding person takes a vote among the nucleus to receive 
each individual into church fellowship. Each person thus received becomes a 
member of the church and is qualified to vote on the next name. Care should 
be taken to see that full fellowship and brotherly love exist among those 
received into membership. Should any difficulty arise in any case over a 
question either of doctrine or of fellowship, action should be deferred unless 
the matter can be adjusted kindly and tactfully.
When the nucleus has voted on all potential members, the church is a 
complete entity and ready for election of officers. Members then should 
choose a nominating committee, with the officiating pastor serving as 
chairperson. The nominating committee brings in nominations to fill the 
various church offices. When these have been elected, the elders should be 
ordained, unless they have already been ordained as elders. A similar but 
shorter service should take place for ordination of deacons and deaconesses. 
The church then is fully organized and ready for service.
Before the organizing meeting ends, the members should vote to request 
the conference to receive the newly organized church into the sisterhood of 
churches at the next conference session.
To maximize success of the new congregation, conference and local 
leaders should see that all officers are fully instructed concerning their duties. 
The church also should have the materials needed for the communion service, 
which, if possible, should be celebrated as part of the organizational meeting. 
The treasurer, the clerk, and the other officers should receive all the necessary 
records or equipment needed to carry out their responsibilities

                <h2>Organizing a Company</h2>
                <p>Where a number of isolated believers reside near one another or where 
they belong to a small group, house church, or church planting core group, 
they should consider forming a company of believers for fellowship, worship, 
and mission with the objective of growing into an organized church or 
multiplying house churches in that geographical area.
            
Company status is approved by vote of the conference executive 
committee, which, should it become necessary, may subsequently dissolve 
the company. The division and/or conference should have written guidelines 
for organizing companies within its territory.
            
Church members who are part of small groups or house groups may form 
the nucleus of a new company. Membership of all those who want to be part 
of a company should be held in either the conference church or a local church 
(mother church). If membership for those who want to be part of a company 
is to be held in the conference church, the conference executive committee 
will vote their membership transfers to the conference church and indicate 
that they are part of the new company.
            
When the conference executive committee approves establishment of a 
company, a leadership team should be appointed, including a leader, a clerk, 
and a treasurer. The appointment should be carried out by the district pastor, 
or other pastor appointed by the conference executive committee, in counsel 
with the group being established as a company.
            
All other company appointments should be made by vote of those who 
are part of the group that is forming the company. The district pastor or other 
person authorized by the conference executive committee shall preside at 
such a meeting. Only members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 
regular standing shall be appointed.
            
The leader of a company shall not be ordained to that office and does not 
have the authority to perform those functions that are vested in an elder of a 
church. However, where exceptional circumstances warrant, the conference 
executive committee may appoint a person of church experience and 
leadership ability to serve as elder of the company.
            
Since ordination does not take place in companies, deacons and 
deaconesses should not be elected, but men and women should be voted in 
the local congregation as “company assistants.” Their duties will be similar 
to those performed by the deacons and deaconesses of organized churches 
where activities do not require ordination. (See pp. 82-86.)
            
The clerk of the company shall keep record of all activities and meetings 
of the company and shall send regular statistical reports to the mother church 
or the conference executive secretary. These reports should include statistics 
on attendance and activities of the company, including outreach ministries
conducted during the week or on Sabbath.
            
The treasurer of the company shall keep record of all money received 
and disbursed and shall send promptly, at the time established by the 
conference, all tithes and offerings, other than funds collected for local 
purposes, to the conference treasurer, who also is treasurer of the conference 
church.
            
If the members of an organized company are members of the conference 
church, the company does not possess the right to administer discipline or 
transfer or receive members. All such matters must be referred to the 
conference executive committee, which constitutes the board of the 
conference church. The conference president is the elder of the conference 
church.
            
If the conference organizes a company through a neighboring mother 
church instead of through the conference church, the functions listed above 
(such as reporting and membership) would be cared for by/through the 
mother church.
            
Since a company should want to grow and eventually be recognized as a 
church, its leadership should prepare members for church status by promoting 
all activities generally carried on by a church.

                <h2>Uniting Churches</h2>
                <p>When it is advisable to unite two churches, the conference executive 
committee should recommend such a course. In a duly called meeting, 
presided over by the conference president or the pastor or other ordained 
pastor, each church should vote on the question of union. When favorable 
action has been taken by both churches, a joint meeting of the two churches 
should be arranged, with the conference president presiding or in his absence 
an ordained pastor appointed by the conference.
            
A carefully written statement of agreement should be prepared setting 
forth the reasons for uniting and stating any special matters or conditions 
involved, such as the disposal of property and responsibility for financial 
obligations. It should provide for the new name of the united church and for 
the release from service of all officers of the two churches.
            
Adoption of the agreement by the united body consummates the union 
of the two churches. Members of the new congregation then should choose a 
nominating committee to nominate officers to serve for the remainder of the 
current year.
            
A copy of the agreement should then be filed with the conference.
The entire membership of both churches unites in the new organization. 
It is not permissible to remove any members by failing to include them in the 
membership list at the time of uniting. The united body becomes responsible 
for the order and discipline of all members. Members under discipline should 
be dealt with as provided elsewhere in this manual.
            
All records of both churches become a part of the records of the united 
body. The local conference should be notified so that it may take suitable 
actions at its next session.

                <h2>Dissolving or Expelling a Church</h2>
                <p>“Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might 
sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He might 
present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any 
such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. . . . For no one 
ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does 
the church. For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones” 
(Eph. 5:25-30).
            
This spirit should permeate all efforts to help an erring church and all 
aspects of any discipline that may be applied—always to help and save for 
the cause of God.
            
Church status is not necessarily perpetual. A church may be dissolved or 
expelled from the sisterhood of churches for the following reasons:
1. Loss of Members—Occasionally, despite efforts to preserve a 
church, so many members are lost by moving away or by death or by apostasy 
that the existence of the church is threatened. Under such circumstances the 
conference executive committee should recommend possible dissolution of 
the church.
            
Before a church takes final action to dissolve, the remaining members 
shall be invited to transfer their memberships to other churches.
If enough members remain, the congregation may call a business 
meeting, presided over by the conference president or by a pastor designated 
by him, to vote to approve letters requesting transfer of all members in regular 
standing to unite with other churches. In this way the church dissolves itself 
upon recommendation of the conference executive committee, and the way 
is opened for the conference executive committee to take action recording 
dissolution of the church.
            
If, in the judgment of the conference executive committee, there are too 
few members available to call a business meeting, the conference executive 
committee shall have the authority to recommend transfer of members in 
regular standing to other churches or to the conference church. In this way 
the church is dissolved.
            
If at the time of dissolution there are members who are under discipline 
and therefore cannot be granted letters saying they are in regular standing, 
their memberships shall be provisionally held in the conference church while 
conference administration ensures that every effort is made as soon as 
possible to help such members to a satisfactory Christian experience. If the 
efforts are successful, their memberships may then be confirmed in the 
conference church or letters granted to them for transfer to other churches. If 
they cannot be reclaimed, they should be removed from membership by vote 
of the conference executive committee.
            
2. Discipline—Occasions for expelling a church for disciplinary 
reasons are rare because the mission of the church is to seek and to save. 
Where serious problems such as apostasy, refusal to operate in harmony with 
the Church Manual, or rebellion against the conference persist, earnest efforts 
should be made to avert the need for expulsion. The pastor should seek to
deepen the spiritual life of the church through preaching and personal 
visitation ministries. The conference should encourage a series of revival 
meetings to lead the members to renew their covenant with their Lord. If these 
efforts are unsuccessful, the pastor, in cooperation with the conference 
executive committee, should counsel with the church and its leadership, 
seeking to bring healing and reconciliation and to preserve the church.
            
Such remedial measures are preferable to permitting the deterioration of 
relationships, which could lead to expulsion of the church.
However, if all efforts to preserve the church fail, the conference 
executive committee should give careful study to the question of expulsion. 
If such action is decided upon, the conference shall follow the following 
procedure:
            
a. The decision to recommend expulsion, with supporting reasons, 
shall be presented to the church itself in a business meeting for its information 
and consideration.
b. If the church does not accept the recommendation, it may 
respond in one of the following ways:
1) Eliminating the causes for discipline and accepting the 
conference specifications, request the conference to rescind the 
recommendation to dissolve or expel.
2) Appeal to the union executive committee, or to the division 
in case of a union of churches, to arbitrate on behalf of the church.
c. If the church remains in rebellion, the conference executive 
committee makes a recommendation to a regular or specially called 
constituency meeting that the church be dissolved.
d. If the constituency takes action to expel, the conference shall 
enforce the decision.

                <h2>Care of Members, Records, and Funds</h2>
                <p>Loyal members of a dissolved or expelled church may desire to retain 
their memberships in the Church. To ensure their welfare, their memberships 
shall be provisionally held for up to one year in the conference church to 
allow opportunity for those who desire to have their memberships in the 
conference church confirmed or transferred to another church. Their standing 
shall be evaluated by the conference executive committee, and, if 
satisfactory, the conference executive committee may recommend them for 
membership in the conference church or churches of their choice.
            
The names of members of a dissolved or expelled church who are under 
discipline shall be referred to the conference secretary for early attention by 
the conference executive committee as set out in “Loss of Members,” above.
            
On dissolution or expulsion of a church for loss of members or for 
disciplinary reasons, all offerings, financial accounts, and all property real or 
personal, whether held in the name of the local church or the conference or 
other denominational legal association, are held in trust for the conference.
            
The conference therefore has the right, the authority, and the duty to 
administer, protect, or dispose of such property and funds. All records of the
church are to be held in the custody of the conference secretary and/or 
treasurer.
            
In cases where discipline is not involved, an alternative to dissolving or 
expelling a church is to return it to company status. Such a decision will be 
made by a majority vote of the conference executive committee, following 
consultation with the district pastor and members, and conveyed to the church 
by the pastor or conference representative.
            
At a business meeting (see p. 40), letters of transfer may be voted to all 
remaining members in regular standing to the conference church or to other 
churches in the cases of any members who wish to transfer. At the same 
meeting, the pastor, in counsel with the local members, shall appoint from 
the members of the new company a leadership team, including a leader, a 
clerk, and a treasurer. For details of other organizational matters relating to a 
company, see “Organizing a Company” on pp. 38-40.
