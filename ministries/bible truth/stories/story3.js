  <h2>Lesson 11 - The Nature of Sin</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Sin is Rebellion Against God</h3>
  <p>
    Sin begins as an act of rebellion against the authority and rulership of God, who is both Creator and King of the universe.
    <br>
    <strong>Isaiah 43:15:</strong> “I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.”
    <br>
    This rejection of God’s rightful rule is called sin:
    <br>
    <strong>1 John 3:4 (RSV):</strong> “Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. Sin is Unrighteousness</h3>
  <p>
    God’s commandments are righteous, and refusal to follow them is unrighteousness—this is sin.
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 19:7-11:</strong>
    <br>
    “The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple... the rules of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether... Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. Sin is Dethroning God and Exalting Self</h3>
  <p>
    Sin involves replacing God’s rightful authority with one’s own selfish will, as seen in the rebellion of Lucifer.
    <br>
    <strong>Isaiah 14:12-14:</strong>
    <br>
    “How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn!... You said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of God I will set my throne on high... I will make myself like the Most High.’”
    <br>
    This selfish ambition reflects the essence of sin—putting self in the place of God.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Sin is a Condition of the Heart</h3>
  <p>
    Sin is not just about actions; it stems from inward desires and motives. Jesus emphasized the heart's condition as the root of sinful behavior.
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 5:27-28:</strong>
    <br>
    “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”
  </p>

  <h3>5. The Dreadful Nature of Sin</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible uses vivid imagery to describe the terrible effects of sin:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Isaiah 64:6:</strong> “We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.” — Sin defiles morally.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Isaiah 59:2:</strong> “But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you.” — Sin separates us from God.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Romans 6:23:</strong> “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” — Sin brings death.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Romans 5:12:</strong> “Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned.” — Sin robbed all mankind of eternal life.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. God's Response to Sin</h3>
  <p>
    Although God hates sin, He also loves humanity and has provided a way of salvation through His Son.
    <br>
    <strong>1 John 4:9-10:</strong>
    <br>
    “In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love... that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Sin is more than just breaking rules—it is a fundamental rejection of God’s authority, a corruption of the heart, and a condition that leads to separation and death. Yet, God’s love triumphs over sin through the gift of Jesus Christ, who redeems and restores all who believe in Him.
  </p>

Lesson 11 - The Nature of Sin

Sin is fundamentally a rebellion against God. It begins as an act of defiance against His authority and kingship. God is not only the Creator of the universe but also its rightful ruler. As Isaiah 43:15 declares, “I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.” Sin is essentially a rejection of that rule. In 1 John 3:4, we read, “Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.” This highlights that sin is a choice to reject God's laws and His leadership.
Sin is also described in Scripture as unrighteousness. God’s commandments are pure and just, and when we choose to disobey them, we are embracing unrighteousness. Psalm 19:7-11 paints a beautiful picture of the perfection of God’s law, which revives the soul, brings wisdom, and offers reward to those who obey. Sin, therefore, is choosing the opposite of God's righteousness.
Beyond mere disobedience, sin is about dethroning God and putting ourselves in His place. It is the act of exalting our own will above God's. This was evident in the fall of Lucifer, who in Isaiah 14:12-14 declared his intention to ascend to heaven and make himself like the Most High. That selfish ambition captures the very essence of sin—putting self before God.
Moreover, sin is not just about external actions. It is a condition of the heart. Jesus taught that even thoughts and intentions can be sinful. In Matthew 5:27-28, He said, “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” This shows that sin starts from within, with our desires and motives.
The Bible does not minimize the seriousness of sin. It uses powerful imagery to describe its dreadful nature. Isaiah 64:6 compares us to someone morally unclean, saying that even our righteous acts are like filthy garments. Isaiah 59:2 tells us that sin separates us from God. Romans 6:23 declares that the wages of sin is death, while Romans 5:12 explains that sin entered the world through one man and brought death to all. Sin has robbed humanity of eternal life and intimate fellowship with God.
Despite all this, God’s response to sin is not abandonment but love. Although He hates sin, He loves people. This love is most clearly shown through Jesus Christ. As 1 John 4:9-10 says, “God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him… he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” God's solution to sin is not punishment alone but redemption through His Son.
In conclusion, sin is far more than breaking rules—it is a deep, spiritual condition that reflects a rejection of God’s authority and a distortion of the heart. It brings separation, corruption, and death. But through Jesus Christ, God offers forgiveness, restoration, and eternal life to all who believe.

  <h2>Lesson 12 - The Origin of Sin</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Origin of Sin</h3>
  <p>
    Sin did not begin with humanity; it originated with Satan, who is also known as the devil. He is the original source and continuing power behind all evil in the universe.
    <br>
    <strong>1 John 3:8:</strong> “He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. Satan Was Once Perfect</h3>
  <p>
    Satan was not created evil. He was originally known as <strong>Lucifer</strong>, a being of great beauty and honor among the angels. He was created perfect by God, but fell due to his own decisions.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Ezekiel 28:13:</strong> “You were in Eden, the garden of God... the workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created.”
    <br>
    <strong>Ezekiel 28:15:</strong> “You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.”
    <br><br>
    These verses, though directed at the king of Tyre, symbolically describe the fall of Lucifer. God did not create a Satan, but a perfect and holy being who later chose rebellion.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Lucifer's High Position in Heaven</h3>
  <p>
    Lucifer held a position of great significance in heaven—an “anointed cherub,” a symbol of closeness to God's presence.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Ezekiel 28:14:</strong> “You were the anointed cherub who covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones.”
    <br>
    <strong>Ezekiel 28:16:</strong> “By the abundance of your trading you became filled with violence within, and you sinned; therefore I cast you as a profane thing out of the mountain of God.”
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Root of Sin: Pride</h3>
  <p>
    Lucifer’s fall began with pride. He exalted himself in heart and desired a position equal to God. This self-glorification marked the birth of sin.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Ezekiel 28:17:</strong> “Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor...”
    <br><br>
    The mystery of sin cannot be fully explained. The book <em>The Great Controversy</em> gives insight:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “It is impossible to explain the origin of sin so as to give a reason for its existence... Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it is to defend it... Our only definition of sin is that given in the word of God; it is ‘the transgression of the law’; it is the outworking of a principle at war with the great law of love which is the foundation of the divine government.” (GC 492, 493)
    </blockquote>
  <p></p>

  <h3>5. Satan’s Expulsion from Heaven</h3>
  <p>
    Due to his rebellion, Satan and the angels who followed him were cast out of heaven. His fall was dramatic and tragic.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Isaiah 14:12-14:</strong> “How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground... For you have said in your heart: ‘I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the Most High.’”
    <br><br>
    <strong>Revelation 12:7-9:</strong> “And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail... So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Sin is a spiritual rebellion that began in heaven and was introduced to the earth through Satan's deception of Adam and Eve. Though its origin remains mysterious, Scripture assures us of God's justice and love in allowing the freedom of choice while providing redemption through Jesus Christ.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Romans 5:12:</strong> “Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.”
  </p>

Lesson 12 - The Origin of Sin

Sin did not begin with humans—it started with Satan, also known as the devil. He is the original source and ongoing influence behind all evil in the universe. As 1 John 3:8 tells us, “He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.”
Satan wasn’t always evil. He was originally known as Lucifer, a magnificent angel created by God. He was full of beauty and honor. Ezekiel 28:13 describes him as being in Eden, the garden of God, and says that the workmanship of his timbrels and pipes was prepared the day he was created. Verse 15 goes on to say, “You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.” These verses, though directed at the king of Tyre, are widely understood to symbolically describe Lucifer’s fall. God did not create a devil—He created a perfect being who chose to rebel.
Lucifer held a very high position in heaven. Ezekiel 28:14 calls him the "anointed cherub who covers," meaning he had close access to God's presence. He was on the holy mountain of God and moved among fiery stones—a poetic image of divine authority and privilege. But verse 16 explains that because of his pride and the abundance of his activity, he became filled with violence and sinned. As a result, he was cast out of heaven.
The root of sin was pride. Lucifer became proud because of his beauty. Ezekiel 28:17 says, “Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor.” He desired a throne equal to God's, and in doing so, introduced sin into the universe. The mystery of sin cannot be fully explained. As the book The Great Controversy says: “It is impossible to explain the origin of sin so as to give a reason for its existence... Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it is to defend it... Our only definition of sin is that given in the word of God; it is ‘the transgression of the law’; it is the outworking of a principle at war with the great law of love which is the foundation of the divine government.”
Satan’s rebellion didn’t go unchallenged. Because of it, he and the angels who followed him were expelled from heaven. Isaiah 14:12-14 paints a dramatic picture: “How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!... For you have said in your heart: ‘I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the Most High.’” Revelation 12:7-9 adds more detail, saying there was a war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels, but the dragon—Satan—did not prevail and was cast out, along with his followers.
In summary, sin is a spiritual rebellion that began in heaven and was brought to earth through Satan’s deception of Adam and Eve. Though the origin of sin remains a mystery, Scripture assures us that God, in His justice and love, allows freedom of choice while also offering redemption. Romans 5:12 reminds us, “Just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.”
