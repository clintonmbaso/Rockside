    <h3>About the SYL Course</h3>
    <p>The Senior Youth Leader (SYL) curriculum is for individuals (approved by the church board) who wish to take Senior Youth Ministry to the next level using Biblical principles and contemporary methods.  After completion of the SYL such individuals may be called upon to lead the Ambassador Ministry, Young Adult Ministry, and Public Campus Ministry at the local church.</p>

    <h4>Relationship to Master Guide</h4>
    <p>Both the Master Guide (Junior Youth) and the Senior Youth Leader (Senior Youth) curriculums have some similar requirements and prerequisites. Candidates can attend some lessons together though each curriculum will dictate the emphasis (junior or senior) thus affecting specialization. Those who already completed the Master Guide program may be exempted from some SYL requirements. The diagram below shows the Youth Ministries structure. Please remember that the SYL and MG are not new levels of the department, they are leadership curriculums for Senior Youth and Junior Youth respectively that complement the structure.</p>

    <h4>Senior Youth Pledge</h4>
    <p>Loving the Lord Jesus, I promise to take an active part in the youth ministry of the church, doing what I can to help others and to finish the work of the Gospel in all the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>On March 3rd, 2024, a highly successful seminar was conducted at Kohima SDA Church from 10 to 16 hours specifically tailored for Adventist Youth Ministries Leaders and all interested participants within the District. The seminar focused on crucial topics of leadership, mentorship, conflict resolution, and basic staff training relevant to AYM and leadership roles.</p>

    <p><strong>Seminar Overview</strong></p>
    <p>The seminar was designed to equip attendees with essential skills and knowledge necessary for effective leadership within the district. They were empowered with practical insights and strategies to enhance their roles in mentoring and guiding the youths.</p>

    <p><strong>Attendees</strong></p>
    <p>The seminar attracted 43 attendees from various congregations of our two zones, all dedicated to strengthening their leadership abilities and impact within the church community. The participants exhibited enthusiasm and a strong commitment to youth ministry. Among the attendees was our special guest and instructor: MG Mokwani Nawa, a representative from Midlands East Zambia Conference.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Lessons Covered</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> An interactive session led by MG Mokwani focused on leadership styles suitable for youth engagement, effective communication with young people, decision-making in ministry contexts, and motivating youth involvement in church activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> The mentorship segment led by our KEMD Youth President MG Rabson emphasized the importance of mentorship in nurturing young believers. Attendees learned how to establish meaningful mentor-mentee relationships and guide youth through their spiritual journeys.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Practical strategies were shared by our Chaplain MG Melvin Mwila to help leaders identify and address conflicts within church settings positively and constructively. Real-life examples provided hands-on experience in resolving conflicts among youth.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Staff Training for Youth Leaders:</strong> Participants were introduced to essential staff training principles applicable to youth ministry, including effective onboarding techniques for new volunteers, skills development workshops, and performance management strategies for youth leaders by our Secretary Loveness Mwanza and Parliamentarian MG Morris Chibale.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Certifications</strong></p>
    <p>As a result of their dedication and proficiency demonstrated during the seminar, 21 leaders were awarded certifications in leadership, conflict resolution, and mentorship within our District during the Youth Day on March 16, 2024. These certifications acknowledge their commitment to enhancing AYM practices and fostering positive growth within their respective congregations.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
    <p>It is with great pleasure that we acknowledge the improvement in participant numbers and pass rates in these assessments. The increase in successful candidates reflects the dedication and commitment of the participants and the effectiveness of the preparation and support provided by our leaders in various churches.</p>

    <p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
    <p>For those who did not succeed in these assessments and others who wish to sit for the same exams, it is important to continue preparing diligently. The education team is preparing to request another exam session from the conference to provide further opportunities for candidates to demonstrate their knowledge and skills.</p>
