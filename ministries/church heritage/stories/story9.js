<h2>To all the World</h2>

<p>By 1905 the overseas mission program was expanding as fast as persons were found who were willing to sacrifice. On every continent and throughout the oceanic regions, the Spirit of God was leading men to the light.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Philippines entered by R. A. Caldwell in 1905 and J. L. McElhany in 1906.</li>
  <li>Greece entered by W. E. Howell in 1907.</li>
  <li>New Hebrides entered by C. H. Parker in 1912.</li>
  <li>Solomons entered by G. F. Jones in 1914.</li>
  <li>Highland Indians of South America received F. A. Stahl in 1909.</li>
</ul>

<p>Africa was witness to a rapid northward expansion of the gospel as missionaries from South Africa and America pushed northward through the then British colonies of East Africa. Names like Tarr, Campbell, Stockil, Anderson, Sparrow all list under the pioneers. Today their descendants still continue in most of these countries. The Solusi graveyard is full of markers of these early pioneers, with the university itself a memorial.</p>

<p>Each new venture, each new missionary cannot really just be listed as another statistic. The lives affected, the waves set in motion are still being seen and felt today amplified through many fascinating stories of God’s providential guiding. The student of church history will want to research more on this topic.</p>

<h2>Ingathering Plan Started</h2>

<p>In 1903 a lay member named Jasper Wayne experimented with an idea by giving away <i>Signs of the Times</i> and collecting donated money for missions. The idea caught on and is now an annual practice around the world, as funds are collected in support of the church’s humanitarian and educational work.</p>

<h2>Youth Ministry</h2>

<p><strong>In 1907, youth ministry came into its own</strong> when the new Young People’s Department was added to the General Conference and Elder M. E. Kern was named its first director.</p>

<p>In the Central Union of the U.S., a little booklet was produced in the same year, with Bible texts listed for daily devotions. It was called the <i>Morning Watch</i>. It soon caught on and became a key part of the future Pathfinder Club. Also in 1907, youth received a new plan of study known as the Standard of Attainment, which was a forerunner of the Progressive–AY–Pathfinder classes.</p>

<p>Reading Course plans for senior youth and junior youth were developed and offered by 1908. The Junior Society Lessons (1914) and the Junior Bible Year (1917) joined the resources available for youth ministry.</p>

<p>By 1911, some members thought their children needed something more than the fare they had. They understood that children need to spend time in the outdoors, learn camping skills, with the accompanying benefits of independence, teamwork, and relationship with their Creator that came with the new skills. One response to meeting these needs was the Takoma Indians Club in Maryland; another was the Mission Scouts in Tennessee (1919).</p>

<p>In 1920, the General Conference saw the need of adding a Junior Youth Specialist to the Youth Department, and Harriet Holt was named to the position. She immediately set to work at experimenting with numerous ideas involving the children in outdoor activities, and in 1922 introduced the Progressive Classes, divided into two groups: two classes for Juniors, in what was called the JMV Society (Friend and Companion), and two classes for those youth who would become Junior Youth Leaders in an organization she called the Comrade Band (Comrade and Master Comrade). The last two were eventually changed to what is today known as Guide and Master Guide.</p>

<h2>Training School for Medical Evangelists</h2>

<p>A medical school had been established in Battle Creek, but it left with Dr. Kellogg and later had to close. In 1910, the church opened the <strong>College of Medical Evangelists</strong> in Loma Linda, California.</p>

<p>The institution prospered, and in 1913 a clinic was opened in Los Angeles, which became <strong>White Memorial Hospital</strong>. CME, as the college became known, was later renamed <strong>Loma Linda University</strong>. It has become world-renowned and today is listed for many great accomplishments, including this stated by the American Medical Association: <em>“One of the top three medical schools in the nation for training physicians how to help patients stop smoking.”</em></p>

<h2>World Field Divided</h2>

<p>The last major organizational step to take place after the Union and local Conference levels, done in 1901, came in 1913 when the world field was divided up into <strong>Divisions</strong>. Each Division president is a vice-president of the General Conference. The administrators and departmental staff of both these levels are elected by the General Conference in session. With the expanding work and increasing expenses of transporting delegates, the time between sessions was first lengthened from annual to biennial, then to quadrennial, and in 1970 was voted to become quinquennial– every five years.</p>

<p>It is good for students of church heritage and denominational structure to know the persons currently serving the church at the various relevant levels. Here is a place where you may write in the names of the persons at the General Conference and for your Division, Union, and local field (conference/mission) level who are responsible for the various areas of administration and ministry:</p>

<h2>Messenger to the Remnant Dies</h2>

<p>Ellen White died on July 16, 1915, at the age of 87. Her last words spoken were, <i>“I know in whom I have believed.”</i></p>

<p>During her seventy years of ministry, she wrote more than 100,000 pages, including more than 4,000 magazine articles and at least 8,000 manuscripts and letters. The total of her books today exceeds 120 volumes, including the <i>Manuscript Releases</i> (21 volumes). All of these, along with some additional materials, are now also available on CD-ROM. Every year, the number of languages in which her works are available increases. All of the world’s major languages now contain at least some of her books, and many lesser-known languages and dialects also have portions of her materials in print.</p>

<p>As was always her style, at the last General Conference she attended in 1909, she held out the Bible in her hand and said, <i>“Brethren, I commend to you this book.”</i> To this dedicated, peerless Adventist witness, the Bible was <i>“the only rule of faith and practice.”</i> Her death marked the end of an era, but the influence of her writings, as predicted, continues to guide the church: <i>“the lesser light leading to the greater light.”</i></p>

<h2>A Worldwide Church</h2>

<p>From a one-country operation in the mid-1800s, the church quickly grew and matured into a worldwide movement by the first quarter of the 20th century. This period included survival during World War I (1914-1918), and as this time period drew to a close, the church leadership also began to reflect its global focus.</p>

<p>When A. G. Daniels stepped down from the presidency in 1922, a leader with an international outlook was invited to step in—one who knew missions and understood the modified focus that came with it. W. A. Spicer had served in England and India and had been chairman of the Foreign Missions Board for over two decades. He once remarked in later life, <i>“Only four years between 1900 and 1940 did not find me on a trip abroad.”</i></p>
