<h2>Significant Advances</h2>
<p>The following are some of the advances the church incurred.</p>
<h3>a. Youth Ministry</h3>
<p>The first young people’s society was organized in <strong>Hazelton Township, Michigan</strong>, in <strong>1879</strong>, by two youth – <strong>Harry Fenner</strong>, 17, and <strong>Luther Warren</strong>, 14. Twenty years later (<strong>1899</strong>) the <strong>Ohio Conference</strong> became the first to form a conference-wide youth organization. It was known as <em>Christian Volunteers</em>.</p>

<p>In <strong>1890</strong>, the first youth ministry-related manual appeared under the title “<em>Manual of Suggestions for Those Conducting Youth Meetings</em>.” These ideas spread rapidly: by <strong>1891</strong>, Youth Societies were formed in <strong>Wisconsin</strong>; by <strong>1892</strong>, they had spread to <strong>Australia</strong>; by <strong>1901</strong>, <strong>Missionary Volunteer</strong> membership cards were being issued, and by <strong>1904</strong>, the first <em>Manual of Young People’s Work</em> appeared. To begin with, youth ministry came under the direction of the <strong>Sabbath School Department</strong>, but in <strong>1907</strong>, the <strong>General Conference Youth Department</strong> was formally organized, and Elder <strong>M. E. Kern</strong> was appointed as director.</p>

<h3>b. Colporteur Ministry</h3>
<p>In <strong>1879</strong>, <strong>Ellen White</strong> was shown the need to circulate books as widely as possible among the public. Two years later, <strong>George King</strong> felt burdened to sell <strong>Uriah Smith’s</strong> book <em>Daniel and the Revelation</em>. The plan was very successful and introduced the colporteur ministry to the church. Today, thousands around the world either make their living through this ministry or earn school scholarships during the summer months.</p>

<h3>c. Tithing Adopted</h3>
<p>The tithing system replaced the <em>systematic benevolence</em> plan in <strong>1878</strong>. The new combination of tithes and book sales greatly strengthened all phases of ministry. The plan of tithes and systematic offerings has enabled the church to finance a worldwide mission and institutional development program.</p>

<h3>d. Church Statistics</h3>
<p>By <strong>1883</strong>, twenty years after organization, the number of churches had increased over five-fold from the original <strong>125</strong> to <strong>680</strong>, membership had jumped five-fold from <strong>3,500</strong> to about <strong>17,500</strong>, and tithe now was ready to surpass the <strong>$100,000</strong> mark.</p>

<h3>e. World View Becomes Truly Global</h3>
<p>General Conference president <strong>George I. Butler</strong> visited Europe in <strong>1884</strong> and led in forming the European Conference. <strong>Ellen White</strong> also paid an extended visit to Europe the following year.</p>

<p><em>Australia</em> received a party led by <strong>S. N. Haskell</strong>, <strong>M. C. Israel</strong>, and <strong>J. O. Corliss</strong>, who were able to start a very strong work there in spite of considerable opposition. An early order of business was to open a publishing house in Melbourne.</p>

<p><em>New Zealand</em> was next to receive the Advent Message when Elder Haskell went in <strong>1885</strong> and then <strong>A. G. Daniells</strong> traveled there in <strong>1886</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Pitcairn Island</em> opened up with a visit by <strong>John I. Tay</strong> in <strong>1886</strong>, and the <em>Fiji Islands</em> were opened by <strong>J. E. Fulton</strong>, for whom now there is a college on the islands that bears his name.</p>

<p><em>Africa</em> received the message during the same year (<strong>1886</strong>). An excellent book (long out-of-print but still around) on the early years in Africa is <em>Desert Track and Jungle Trail</em> by Virgil Robinson. It was in <strong>1894</strong> that <strong>Pieter Wessels</strong> and a small delegation visited with <strong>Cecil Rhodes</strong>, Prime Minister of Cape Colony, requesting a piece of land for a mission in Rhodesia. Rhodes instructed the administrator in Bulawayo to permit the SDA representatives to select whatever land they needed– and Solusi College was born.</p>

<p>In <strong>1888</strong>, a humble man by the name of <strong>Abram La Rue</strong> went to Hong Kong as a self-supporting colporteur, visited China, and prepared the way for missionaries <strong>Edwin H. Wilbur</strong> and <strong>J. N. Anderson</strong> to enter China fourteen years later.</p>

<h3>f. A Time to Review</h3>
<p>During the <strong>1860's</strong> and <strong>1870's</strong>, Adventist evangelists were so busy proving that God’s law had not been abolished at the cross that they gave little attention to the <strong>“faith of Jesus”</strong> and stressed <strong>“the commandments of God.”</strong> There were also still some who held Arian views of Christ and who did not believe in the Trinity nor in the personality of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>With this background, the <strong>General Conference session of 1888</strong>, held at Minneapolis, Minnesota, became a very significant and pivotal meeting in our church history. A crisis had been reached and now dealt with. The decade following was marked by revivals, and righteousness by faith was vigorously discussed and, by many, gratefully accepted. A full and well-documented study of this meeting has been published under the title <em>Movement of Destiny</em>, by <strong>Leroy Edwin Froom</strong> (Review, 1971).</p>

<p>A number of new books written by <strong>Ellen White</strong> were introduced during this period, including <em>The Desire of Ages</em> and <em>Steps to Christ</em>, designed to help correct erroneous teachings on the nature of Christ and endorsing the truth of righteousness by faith.</p>

<h3>g. Institutional Expansion</h3>
<p>The first <strong>SDA</strong> college outside of North America was opened near <strong>Cape Town, South Africa</strong>, in <strong>1893</strong> as the forerunner of today’s <em>Helderberg College</em>.</p>

<p>Other early institutions overseas were:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Signs Publishing Company</strong>, Australia, <strong>1886</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Stanborough Press</strong>, England, <strong>1889</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hamburg Publishing House</strong>, Germany, <strong>1889</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Avondale College</strong>, Australia, <strong>1897</strong></li>

<h3>h. Ellen White goes to Australia</h3>
<p>In <strong>1891</strong>, Ellen White sailed for <strong>Australia</strong> and remained there for nine years (including several months in <strong>New Zealand</strong>).</p>

<p>While there, she founded <strong>Avondale College</strong> and encouraged the establishment of health food factories. The <strong>Sanitarium Health Food Company</strong> (1898) was established as a result and is today a very successful major supplier of health foods in the <strong>South Pacific</strong>, as well as a big financial backer of the South Pacific Division.</p>

<h3>i. First Union Conference</h3>
<p>The first regional grouping of conferences to be formed as a <strong>Union Conference</strong> took place in <strong>Australia</strong> in <strong>1894</strong>. Today, there are <strong>95 Unions</strong> in the world church, according to the <strong>1997 statistical report</strong>.</p>

<h3>j. Reorganization</h3>
<p>The <strong>General Conference of 1901</strong> was one of the most significant sessions for the church and its structure. Major changes took place in the management structure, which gave much greater freedom of decision-making to the church at the local level, allowing for maximum expansion “into all the world.” Some of the changes that were instituted include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>General Conference Committee</strong> was enlarged and made more representative.</li>
  <li><strong>Union conferences/missions</strong> and <strong>local conferences/missions</strong> became the pattern of organization.</li>
  <li>Conferences were to share their tithes and offerings with the <strong>missions</strong>.</li>
  <li>Various independent organizations representing various interests of the denomination became <strong>departments of the General Conference</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This <strong>1901 session</strong> became known as the “turning point toward unity, reform, solvency, and ardent evangelism.”</p>

<h2>Significant Losses</h2>
<p>The following are some of the losses the church incurred.</p>
<h3>a. Pioneers Called to Rest</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>James White</strong> died in <strong>1881</strong>. His death heralded an end to the era of the pioneers in America.</li>
  <li><strong>John Byington</strong>–<strong>1887</strong>. The first president of the General Conference is buried next to the first Adventist in Battle Creek (David Hewitt). For his funeral, he had previously chosen as the text Revelation 3:21: “To him that overcometh....”</li>
  <li><strong>John N. Andrews</strong>– <strong>1883</strong>; <strong>J. H. Waggoner</strong>– <strong>1889</strong>. Both are buried in Basel, Switzerland.</li>
  <li><strong>Uriah Smith</strong>– <strong>1903</strong>, longtime editor of the <em>Review</em>; his book <em>Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation</em> is still much used today. His death coincided with the end of the Battle Creek era as well.</li>

<h3>b. Bright Stars Disappear</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>D. M. Canright</strong>, a leading minister, left the church and became an ardent opposer of the movement. He died a broken and forgotten man.</li>
  <li><strong>Dr. J. H. Kellogg</strong>, administrator of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, mixed pagan pantheism with the Bible, left and managed to take the hospital with him.</li>

<h3>c. Fire Destroys Institutions</h3>
<p>For some time Battle Creek was developing into an Adventist “cloister.” The members there were warned by God several times not to concentrate in one location but to scatter out and take the “Good News” with them. In 1893 they were warned that the institutions would be destroyed if they did not decentralize.</p>

<p>In February, 1902, the main building of the sanitarium burned down. In December of the same year, the Review factory was destroyed by fire. Finally, in 1903, Ellen White’s advice to move the headquarters east was heeded and property purchased near the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C.</p>
