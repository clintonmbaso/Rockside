    <h3>ABOUT MASTER GUIDE</h3>
    <p>This is one of the most current leadership development program for youth ministry in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The Master Guide is the foundation for youth ministry leadership, then builds two levels of continuing education that will help keep youth leaders sharp.</p>
  <p>The Master Guide (MG) curriculum is one of the leadership programs that the General Conference Youth Ministries Department uses to train people for youth leadership. You cannot earn your Master Guide without taking at least one Basic Staff Training (BST) course.</p>
  <p>The Master Guide is the advisor and the promoter for Adventurers and Pathfinders. As such, MG is NOT a Pathfinder program, it is a Youth Ministry Leadership Program.</p>
  
  <h3>MASTER GUIDE LEADERSHIP</h3>
  <p>This continues to be the highest level of leadership within the Adventurer/ Pathfinder programs of the church. It focuses on one’s personal spiritual life and growth first and foremost. General leadership skills are then woven into the sharpening of those skills, which are specifically geared to leading youth in God-ordained areas of development: understanding God’s world of nature, outreach ministry, service to others and a life-style that denotes healthy living.</p>
  <p>As one church leader of the past put it so simply: “You can’t teach what you don’t know, and you can’t lead where you won’t go.” As leaders we must not only be good at spouting theory if we expect to see success with our youth ministry; we must live what we preach and demonstrate it. </p>
   <h4>Master Guide Flag</h4>

    <h4>Master Guide Pledge</h4>
    <p>Loving the Lord Jesus, I promise to take an active part in Adventurers, Pathfinders and Youth Ministries, doing what I can to finish the work of the gospel in all the world.</p>
  <h4>Master Guide Emblem</h4>
  <img src="images/3. Master Guide Logo.png" alt="Master Guide Logo">
    <h4>Meaning of the Master Guide Emblem</h4>
    <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Blue (Loyalty)</span></strong> - It is the purpose of the Master Guide Club to teach us to be loyal to: Our God in heaven, Our family, Our church. Loyalty is defined as a reflection of the character of our true Master Guide. </p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: gold;">Gold (Excellence)</span></strong> - "I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich" (Rev. 3:18) Standards of measurement. The Master Guide Club has high standards to help build effective Christian leaders, dependent on God, in order to complete the mission and return to our heavenly home. </p>
    <p><strong>Six Stars (AY Classes)</strong> - Representing the six levels: Friend, Companion, Explorer, Ranger, Voyager, and Guide. This is the original primary goal for the Master Guide ministry. However, without abandoning this objective, the Master Guide ministry is also intended to serve other classes (like Adventurer Club levels) and all ministries in the Seventh-day Adventist Church as needed. </p>
    <p>About the stars symbol, Ellen White mentioned, “There will be no one saved in heaven with a starless crown. If you enter, there will be some soul in the courts of glory that has found an entrance there through your instrumentality.” (Last Day Events, p. 282) </p>

    <h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
       <p style="color:blue;"><em>All prerequisites must be completed prior to beginning the program.</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>BE A BAPTIZED MEMBER, IN REGULAR STANDING, OF THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH</b></li>
      <p>Becoming a Master Guide is a major recognition of youth leadership by the church; therefore, it is expected that all participants will not only be baptized members of the church, 
but will also model a viable, dynamic lifestyle exemplifying the best of Christian standards. 
While baptism may be the visible, measurable fulfillment of this prerequisite, a clear reflection of Christ in the life of the participant is the ultimate objective.</p>
      <p>The Master Guide program is not intended for training of secular or non-Christian leaders. It is intended to provide training for Adventists who desire to lead and mentor youth 
and serve in the church. As such, you need to be committed to the Seventh-day Adventist 
church and its unique beliefs. This commitment is exhibited not only in your Christian walk, 
but in your regular participation within the life and ministry of the local church.</p>
      <p><b>PORTFOLIO COMPLETION</b></p>
      <p><em>Provide a copy of a document such as:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Baptismal certificate.</li>
                <li>Photo of your baptism.</li>
                <li>Church bulletin that includes your baptism by name.</li>
                <li>Letter from church clerk or pastor confirming membership.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
      <br>
      
        <li><b>BE AT LEAST 16 YEARS OF AGE TO START THIS CARD AND 18 YEARS OF AGE AT INVESTITURE</b></li>
      <p>While most who participate in the Master Guide program are young adults, this course is 
a natural sequence following the Guide class. Therefore, it is open to individuals 16 or 17 
years of age who have found fulfillment in Adventurer and Pathfinder ministries and wish to 
continue developing their skills and interests as club staff. Adults of any age may become 
candidates for investiture as a Master Guide, as long as they fulfill all prerequisites of the 
curriculum.</p>
      <p>As most jurisdictions require individuals to be at least 18 years of age before they can assume the full role and responsibilities of an adult, it naturally follows that a Master Guide 
should fit the same legal requirements. This in no way minimizes the amazing skills, passion 
and commitment of many teenage leaders, but simply recognizes the legal implications of 
leadership.</p>
            <p><b>PORTFOLIO COMPLETION</b></p>
      <ul>
          <li>Include a copy of an official ID to verify your age.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      
        <li><b>COMPLETE A BACKGROUND CHECK AND CHILD 
PROTECTION COURSE, AND BE APPROVED BY 
YOUR CONFERENCE/MISSION</b></li>
      <p>Jesus placed a high value on the protection of children (Matthew 18:1-6); therefore, child 
protection is an essential element in all church-sponsored children’s activities. As leaders, 
we have a moral and civil duty to protect the children and youth entrusted to us. “Church 
should be a safe place to bring our children. Everyone involved with children who are minors 
must meet all Church and legal standards and requirements.” (Church Manual, Edition 19, 
174-175). The Seventh-day Adventist Church is committed to providing safe worship and 
educational environments to help children and youth learn to love and follow Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>The main goal for a background check is to uncover criminal records, specifically sex offender records, which could represent a threat for children and youth. The way to perform a background check varies from country to country, so the candidate should consult your 
local Conference/Mission and identify the standard procedure for your area. Although a 
report from the local church board could be a valuable reference, an official background 
check is preferable when possible</p>
      <p>The child protection course should be approved by your Conference/Mission based on the 
regulations of your country. The course may be offered as one of the basic staff training 
workshops.</p>
      <p><b>RESOURCES</b></p>
                <p><em>We recommend that the instructor of the child protection course visit <a href="www.adventistrisk.org">www.adventistrisk.org</a>, select their own country and language, and type Pathfinders on the search engine. 
This procedure will provide more accurate information for the local area from a legal perspective. Most of the principles of safety used for Pathfinders will also apply to Adventurers 
since participants of both groups are minors.</em></p>
            <p><b>PORTFOLIO COMPLETION</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A certificate or letter from your Conference/Mission or the issuing organization stating 
the candidate has passed the background check.</li>
      <li>Instructor signature for the child protection course.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      
        <li><b>WITH YOUR MENTOR, PRAYERFULLY DISCUSS 
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MASTER GUIDE AND 
WHY YOU WANT TO BECOME A MASTER GUIDE. 
INCLUDE A WRITTEN ONE-PAGE REPORT OR 
VIDEO IN YOUR PORTFOLIO</b></li>
      <p>Prayer is the first step for any major decision in the life of a Christian. God says: “I will instruct 
you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.” 
(Psalm 32:8, NIV). God’s direction and advice are always our best option, so praying before 
making decisions as a leader will always be the right procedure. A candidate should also 
seek the advice of a respected mentor, and ask questions to fully understand the decision 
about to be made. This conversation sets the foundation for the leadership development 
journey of the candidate.</p>
      <p>The candidate and mentor should discuss questions such as the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the meaning of Master Guide?</li>
        <li>Why do you want to become a Master Guide?</li>
        <li>How would you use your training for God and the church after investiture?</li>
      </ul>
      
        <p><b>PORTFOLIO COMPLETION</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write a one-page report or record a video summarizing the discussion and your answers to the questions above. Include the date, location, and name of the mentor with 
whom you met.</li>

            </ol>
      <p>The purpose of basic training is to acquaint every volunteer with the fundamentals of ministry in their Adventurer Club or Pathfinder Club. Each workshop should provide candidates 
with useful information and resources that they can use in their local field. Workshops may 
be adapted and/or substituted by the local Conference/Mission to provide the most thorough, relevant training to candidates. The recommended workshop length is 75-90 minutes, and should include a balance of lecture (theory), discussion (processing the information), and practice (applying the lessons). Each workshop should be taught by instructors 
trained and approved by the Conference/Mission.</p>

      <p><b>Additional Notes:</b></p>
      <p><em>Your progress as a candidate is under the supervision of your Conference/Mission. If 
under 18 years of age, you do not have to complete a background check, but you must be supervised by 
an adult when working with minors. Final approval is at the determination of the reviewing Master Guide 
following the guidelines of the local Conference/Mission Youth Director or their designated representative.

       <h3>Motivating Individuals</h3>                
       <p>
One of the prime shortcomings of any group is the inactivity of certain group
members. Any member’s inactivity causes many problems to the group and the group
leader. The obvious problem is the lost resources of inactive group members, which
lessens the effectiveness of the group as a unit. But perhaps the more critical problem is
the demoralizing effect that inactive members have on other members. Their failure to
                   participate and shoulder their share of the load dampens enthusiasm and may eventually
                   result in a marked negative effect on the group. The primary reason some group members
are inactive is that they do not understand the task to be accomplished or what part they are
supposed to play. In many instances, they do not receive sufficient motivation to move
them into action. The fault does not lie within the members. They will usually respond to
the motivation they receive– frequently none at all, or it is applied without regard for the
member’s personal interests or views.
                 </p>
       
       Basic Motivational Principles
Motivation is the source of all action, and inactivity results from a lack of motivation. This
does not necessarily mean a lack of motivational effort; however, mere effort to motivate
does not, of its own accord, produce motivation.
Group action is the result of motivation of the individuals within the group. At times the
varying effects of motivational effort of one type or another may result in confusion or
indifference. Many times when confusion or conflict occurs within the group, it is because
the leader has failed to motivate each individual within the group. It has been rightly stated
that you do not lead groups; rather, you lead the people that make up the group, each as an
individual.
We can draw a parallel between a group leader and a salesman. Salesmanship requires a
great deal of individual motivation. In fact, that is what it is all about. A successful
salesperson “helps” a client “discover” a “desire” for the salesperson’s product or service
before closing the sale. Salespeople who see only their own desire for making the sale
(income) and do not spend adequate time relating to their prospect’s desires soon discover
that they are no longer selling.
The same is true when motivating a group. When the leader disregards the desires of the
individuals within the group, he soon finds he is no longer leading. The members have
received no motivation that meet their needs, and they respond by doing nothing.
“There is no such thing as a group member who cannot be motivated. Every living person
is motivated everyday to do something. Once a person links himself emotionally with a
group as a result of interest shown in his individual desires, he can be motivated to do
many things that are contrary to his own personal desires in order to benefit the group.
When that point is reached, he finds fulfillment in achieving for the group rather than for
himself.”
As a leader, you must be able to get your group and its individual members moving– and
keep them moving– in the desired direction.
In attempting to motivate individuals, we need to recognize that individual needs are
especially important and play a major role in determining what “gets people going.”
       
Current research suggests that people usually motivate themselves by responding to their
inner needs. Leaders need to understand these needs and how they operate so that they can
work with human nature, not against it.
Abraham Maslow, in his concept of a hierarchy of needs, suggests that individual needs are
arranged in order of priority, with the stronger needs desiring satisfaction before other
needs can be met.
Physiological 
Safety 
Social 
Esteem 
Self-Actualization
Physiological needs– These are a person’s physical needs for food, shelter, warmth, sexual
gratification and other basic body functions.
Safety– These include the need to feel safe from physical danger and the need for physical,
mental and emotional security.
Social– These include the need for friendships and interaction with other people, a sense of
belonging and acceptance within a social circle.
Esteem– These needs fall into two closely-related categories– self esteem and the esteem of
others. The first includes our need to respect ourselves, to feel personal worth, adequacy
and competence. The second embraces our need for respect, praise, recognition and status
in the eyes of others.
Self-actualization– The need to achieve as much as possible, to fully develop one’s gifts or
potential.
Maslow makes two interesting points about these needs. First, if one of our stronger needs
is threatened, we jump back down the steps to defend it. You do not worry about status,
for example, if you are starving. Therefore, if you appear to threaten people’s security by
your proposed changes as a leader, you should expect a stoutly defended response.
Second, a satisfied need ceases to motivate. When one area of need is met, the person
concerned becomes aware of another set of needs. These in turn now begin to motivate
him or her. There is obviously a lot of truth in this theory. In particular, when the
physiological and security needs have been satisfied, they do not move us so strongly.
How far this principle extends up the scale is a matter for discussion.
Elsewhere in his work, Maslow postulated other hierarchies of need, which he identified
like galaxies in the vast reaches of the unconscious mind: cognitive needs (curiosity, the
need to discover and understand) and aesthetic needs (the need for beauty, order and
elegance). In later life he also talked about what could be called spiritual needs, the need to
escape from oneself and feel part of some larger transcendent unity above the self. As a
       
secular humanist, Maslow did not give the name “God” to this Welcoming Other in which
self is both lost and found, but the influence of the Jewish tradition in which he was reared
is clearly evident. Certainly there are great human needs behind the search for God.
Another expression of this understanding of humans as essentially self-motivating was
suggested by Herzberg, who believed that the following five motivators provide
satisfaction to individual needs:
1. Achievement
· A sense of personal achievement in the work being accomplished
and brought to a successful conclusion.
· A sense that one is making a worthwhile contribution to the
objectives of the group.
· The sense of achievement is in proportion to the size of the
challenge.
2. Recognition
· Acknowledging a person’s contribution.
· Appreciating the work being done.
· Receiving adequate recognition for achievements.
3. Interest
· A feeling that the work is challenging and demanding the best from
the individual.
4. Responsibility
· Being allowed to control the work being done.
· Being trusted.
· Having authority to make decisions and being accountable for work
done.
5. Advancement
· A feeling that as an individual, one is developing and advancing in
experience and ability.
· The prospect of promotion or advancement.
· Providing the right climate and opportunities for meeting these
needs for each individual in the group is possibly the most difficult
and certainly the most challenging and rewarding task of the group
leader.
Group Activity:
Ask the group to identify four major problem persons presently encountered in their club or
unit. Use the resources of the group to arrive at a solution/understanding of how to
motivate these individuals.
       
Motivating Young Adolescents

Build Relationships

Provide environment.

They must believe that adults are important to them.

Be honestly supported or rejected by others as a person capable of directing his
or her future behavior.

Personal encouragement– caring one-on-one relationship.

Be a Model

Adults whom they like and respect for their behavior and attitudes.

Adults with a development of logical reasoning.

Be Careful of Stereotypes

Don’t assume that early physical developers will act more maturely than peers
who have yet begun to grow.

Don’t assume that physically attractive adolescents are intelligent and
responsible.

Don’t assume that unattractive or overweight adolescents are undisciplined,
irresponsible, or lazy.

Adult expectations of them, “We act like we are treated.”

Provide Opportunities for Youth to Take Initiative

Provide activities that teach-- self-motivating.

Let them assume responsibility for shaping their environment.

Provide consistent limits for acceptable behavior.

Give them enough structure so that initiative can most likely be met.

Relinquish the amount of control they can successfully handle and appreciate.

Involve Youth in Decision-making

Structure ways to give increasing amounts of autonomy
° in establishing rules
° in selecting and planning programs
° in negotiating individual and group contracts
° in selecting group rewards
° in actually conducting activities
° in evaluating the program

Balance youth autonomy and adult control as to capabilities of the individuals.

Allow as much control as they can manage.

Provide controls that are necessary to protect youth from harm due to their own
inexperience, but reduce adult-imposed controls as young people gain
experience and responsibility.

Make Peer Influence Positive

While peers do have an increasing influence on behavior, most adolescents retain
their family values.

Can be a motivator
° Make rules that govern behavior
       
       
Plan activities that require collaboration rather than competitive efforts.
° Set group goals and rewards that require cooperation.
° Plan activities where the peer group receives recognition for helping or
making a contribution.
° Engage groups in role-playing and simulation games.
° Peer counseling.
° Peer tutoring.

Tap Young Adolescents’ Desire to Make Commitments

Short-term goal or provide an honorable out.

Commitment should be of one’s own choosing.

“Choice” contributes to sense of personal autonomy.

Should be truly meaningful to them or to others.

Provide Safe Opportunities for Risk-taking

Risk-taking is a normal part of growing up.

Risk can help young adolescents grow, test their physical, cognitive and social
skills against reality and feel good about themselves.

Risk provides challenge. As long as the situation is not too threatening, risktaking provides help in motivating, is constructed to promote self-esteem
and protects them from physical or emotional harm.
Using Enthusiasm to Motivate Others
One of the best tools of personality development is enthusiasm. If you are really
excited about life, you will be bubbling over with enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is a way to
attract people so that they will become immediately interested in you and what you are
saying. Once you capture this enthusiasm, you will no longer be lonely.
Enthusiasm is a welcome commodity. Everyone needs it. It fills a personal demand. It
enhances the feeling of well-being. It inspires the efforts of others and helps them to renew
their efforts. It steps up their power-drive, as well as yours. It washes away
discouragement and gives a refreshing new desire to move ahead. It neutralizes
selfishness, anger and hatred. Enthusiasm inspires confidence. It establishes rapport
achieved in no other way, and because people need direction, they are attracted to the
enthusiastic personality.

How to Develop Your Enthusiasm
1) Have faith in yourself and others. “Faith,” as one psychologist puts it, “is
the inner core of self-confidence, optimism, and enthusiasm.”
2) Combat skepticism with positive thinking... then convert your thoughts
into action. Track down solutions instead of concentrating on the dire
consequences of defeat.
3) Smile– A smile is the most potent weapon. Take a tip from Mark Twain,
who said, “Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.”
       
4) Give generously of yourself. The enthusiast is fond of people, has time
to help others, and has energy to spare.
5) Focus on the advantages instead of dwelling on reasons why a project or
idea won’t succeed. Find ways to make it work!
6) Don’t let obstacles get you down. Beethoven was deaf. Edison was a
failure at school. Teddy Roosevelt was a physical wreck as a youth. Fanny
Crosby was blind. Helen Keller could not speak, hear or see. Booker T.
Washington overcame prejudice. All these people had one thing in
common– they were determined to succeed and believed that they could and
would succeed. It was enough to carry them on.
7) Rally others to your cause. Enthusiasts are born leaders. People are
drawn naturally and willingly to their enthusiasm and go-go-go.
You may be wondering how you can generate enthusiasm. Maybe you think you are not
the enthusiastic type. Well, you can believe it’s not true, because in every personality there
is a degree of enthusiasm. Would you like to build a higher degree of enthusiasm or would
you rather let the world pass you by? (That’s one of those choice situation questions
referred to earlier in this course, right?)
Here are some practical pointers that can help you develop enthusiasm:

Color everything you do or say– consciously ignite your smile, your “hello,”
your eyes and your words. Make your conversation sparkle. Color everything you do with
friendliness. Let the warmth and friendliness of your personality shine.

Know what you are saying or doing– shy or embarrassed people often speak
without thinking. Some nervous people feel that they must speak and become very
confused in their expression. To develop the depth of your enthusiasm, know what you are
saying and doing at all times.

Praise people. Be warm. Be kind. Be sincere. Compliment people for what
they do. Spread compliments in all directions. Wherever you are, whatever you are doing,
make someone feel your enthusiasm through praise. People hunger for praise. Praise is
power– but be sure you mean it.

Don’t be opinionated– enthusiastic people do not push their opinion onto people.
They stimulate listeners with the positive approach and at no time inflict personal beliefs.

Look for good things in and about people– refuse to listen to negative talk from
yourself or others. Don’t listen to gossip, jump to conclusions or harbor grudges. Doubts
promote misunderstanding and anchor personality to everything negative. Look for the
best in everyone.

Sleep well and eat properly– sleep and proper nutrition play a role in the brighter
personal approach to people. To ensure your best personality performance, keep physically
fit. Enthusiasm has its beginnings in the foundation that supports it. Keep well, sleep well
and you won’t have to be artificial about enthusiasm.

Find interests in common with others– decide what you are interested in and join
       
a club that caters to your special interest. You will meet new friends and find a great boost
to your personality development.

Don’t worry– delete gossip and everything nasty in your life. Do not dispense
worry, anger or hate. Wash out everything negative from your life. Transmit happiness to
all. Remember the Pathfinder Law– “Keep a song in my heart.”

Be amusing, be happy– the enthusiastic person has a sense of humor. It bubbles
over from a fountain of friendliness. Be happy and make others happy.

Offer encouragement– nothing makes others see you as an enthusiastic person
better than your ability to encourage them. Listen to people. Help them with their
problems. Let them complain and get the misery out of their souls, and fill their aching
void with hope and courage and the feeling of success. Make them feel better because of
your presence, your interest and your encouragement.

Make others feel important– everyone wants to feel that she/he has a place in the
world, a place to be recognized. Through your enthusiasm, you can show others they are
important.

Render personalized attention– in the enthusiastic approach there is nothing
better than personalized attention. This attention must be defined. Talk and do in terms of
the other person’s understanding. Give pleasure. Make your friends know you care.


Apply Your Enthusiasm
People who live enthusiastically possess a mystic quality that most others find attractive.
Such people are human dynamo-- alert, active, enterprising, always excited about some
new venture or endeavor. This can be YOU.
Obviously they are picturesque, powerful personalities, potential leaders, with vital,
inquiring minds. What they do they undertake with zest and enthusiasm. They cannot fail
       
to create a good impression either in the social or business worlds.
If you are enthusiastic and want to make friends, by all means show it. Do not stifle that
important and attractive quality under the blankets of reserve and self-consciousness.

Stabilize Your Enthusiasm
· Place new ideas immediately on paper. Work out a plan of action. Put
your ideas to work. Ideas are a stimulant to enthusiastic living and give you
new power.
· Permit controlled excitement to mount in you. It raises your energy level.
· Utilize action to step up body function. Ideas don’t just happen. Someone
makes them happen, and someone puts them into action.
· Keep an “anticipation pad.” Write down all ideas that come to you. Leave
the idea for a few hours while your subconscious thinks it over, and then
work on it again.

Add This Last Ingredient Now
In achieving goals enthusiastically, it is vital to know what is most valuable and important
to you. When you know what you want, go after it. Don’t get bogged down in details.
Don’t be anchored by waste or boredom. If you want to find happiness and have peace of
mind, become enthusiastic.

A. Communication Process

40 minutes
1. What Communication Is
We often assume that if someone’s lips are moving, communication is taking place.
It involves more than talking. It is the receiving or listening process, as well. To this
twofold process we should add a third dimension– understanding. Frequently we think we
       
understand what someone is saying, but what we hear is not what she/he meant. We want
other people to listen to and understand what we have to say.
2. Five Levels of Communication
In his book Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? author John Powell describes
five levels on which we can communicate. Understanding these five levels is essential.
· Level 1-Small Talk. At this level shallow conversation takes place, such as, “How
are you?” “What have you been doing?” “How are things going?” Such
conversation borders on the meaningless, but it can sometimes be better
than embarrassed silence. When communication remains on this level, it is
boring and leads to frustration and resentment in relationships.
· Level 2-Factual Conversation. At this level information is shared, but there are no
personal comments along with it. You tell what has happened but do not
reveal how you feel about it. Men are more apt to settle for this level than
women, as they are often less able to express their feelings.
· Level 3-Ideas and Opinions. Real intimacy begins here, for on this level you risk
exposing your own thoughts, feelings and opinions. Because you feel free
to express yourself and verbalize personal ideas, your partner has a better
chance to know you intimately.
· Level 4-Feelings and Emotions. Communication at this level describes what is
going on inside you, how you feel about someone else or a situation. You
verbalize feelings of frustration, anger, resentment or happiness. If you
honestly share with someone else in a give-and-take manner, showing
interest in his/her feelings, as well as in expressing your own, this will
enrich and enlarge your relationship. You will feel worthy, noticed, loved
and appreciated. You will gain flashes of insight into your friend’s
character that will give you real understanding of how she/he thinks and
feels. A good combination is to alternate between the levels of
ideas/opinions and feelings/emotions.
· Level 5-Deep Insight. Rare insightful moments will occur when you are perfectly
in tune with another in understanding, depth and emotional satisfaction.
Usually a peak experience or something deeply personal is related.
Communication about such experiences often makes a deep impression on
both parties and enriches the relationship. Mutual sharing of personal ideas
and feelings is the ultimate goal in communication especially in mental
relationships.
For thought: What level of communication occurs in your relationships now? Do you want and need a
deeper and more intimate sharing?
3. The Conversation-angle of Communication
We spend approximately 70 percent of our waking hours in communication–
      speaking, listening, reading or writing. Thirty-three percent of this time is devoted to
talking. This element of our time becomes very important, for talk brings people together
in a relationship.
The avenue of speech goes beyond the exchange of words or information. Through
talking we can express our feelings, convey our emotions, clarify our thinking, reinforce
our ideas and make contact with others. It is a pleasant way of passing time, getting to
know one another, releasing tension and expressing opinions. The most basic function of
speaking, then, is not the giving of information but the establishing of a relationship with
others. The quality of this relationship will depend a great deal on the ability of each
person to express themselves verbally.
4. Barriers to Effective Speech

The “solution sender” weighs down his speech with orders, directions and commands.
“Get over here.” “Hurry up.” Warning and threats comprise more solutions. “If
you ever do that again, I’ll...” Another is moralizing. “Don’t you know enough not
to...” Most of us resent being told that we must, should, or had better do
something.

Many of us resort to “put-downs” in spite of the fact that we know what it feels like to
be put down. Put-downs judge, criticize and blame: “That’s not a bad idea,
considering you thought of it.” They name, ridicule and shame: “You’re a slob.”
They interpret, diagnose and psychoanalyze: “You only say that because...” They
attempt to teach and instruct.

Then there is the “corrector.” For example, while the club member tells a story to
friends, his leader helps him keep the facts straight:
“We left on Wednesday night...”
“No, I think it was Thursday night just before the holiday.”
“OK, we left Thursday right after we got home from school.”
“No, it was late that evening when we got away.”
“Well, anyway... oh, you tell it...”
“No, you’re doing fine.”
A corrector has a compulsion to concentrate on proper reporting. Such remarks are
often attempts to draw attention to self, and they show a lack of sensitivity in
allowing someone else to tell a story the way one perceives and remembers it.

The “monologuer” has the compulsive need to talk and frequently insists on having the
last word. She/he can’t bear to be corrected and so maintains a know-it-all attitude.
Often monologuers have a desperate need to be popular, but the more they
monopolize conversations, the more they bore others and cut themselves off from
forming close attachments.

The “silent treatment” uses silence as a weapon or a form of control. When a male is
silent, strong emotions, such as fear or anger, are building up inside. A female
usually uses silence to get even for some injustice done to her or when she reaches
       
the stage of total despair and desperation. The silent treatment may be given
because one person refused to listen last time, or the silent one may be suffering
from a deep hurt. Some Christians feel that it isn’t right to say what they think.
But bottling this emotion takes its toll physically, mentally and spiritually.
5. Rules for Effective Speaking

Choose the right time to communicate to your friend. Your subject may
be well-taken, but your timing may be off. If you have something
personal from levels three or four to share, don’t unload just as your
friend walks in. If you want to talk with your friend in an intimate
way, select a time when your friend can respond pleasantly.

Develop a pleasant tone of voice. It isn’t always what you say, but how
you say it that counts. It is soothing to be around someone with a
soft, calm voice. Make sure you are easy to listen to.

Be clear and specific. Many misunderstandings arise from muddled talk.
Try to think as you speak, and state clearly what you mean. You
can solve the problem of muddled communication by making “a
statement of intent.” For example, “I would like to invite the
Browns over for dinner Sunday. Do you mind?”

Be positive. In many homes, eighty percent of all communication is
negative. These families become so used to hearing fault-finding,
blaming, judging, name-calling and other negative elements that
such behavior becomes normal. Be less negative and more positive
and appreciative.

Be courteous and respectful of your friend’s opinion. You can do this
even when you don’t agree. Care as much about their comfort as
you do about your own. And, be willing to listen. You should talk
no more than fifty percent of the time.

Be sensitive to the needs and feelings of your friend. Develop patience
and sensitivity in responding to what your friend says. If your friend
hurts, you can understand the hurt and even hurt with him/her. Tune
into the needs and feelings of fear, anger, despair and anxiety of your
friend. Likewise, if your friend is happy over a new development,
enjoy that happiness with him/her.

Develop the art of conversation. Conversation is an art, and
opportunities to develop it should be encouraged. Discussion on
interesting topics enriches a relationship.
       
B. Active Listening

40 minutes
1. The Listening Angle of Communication
“Faulty listening,” says one psychoanalyst, “is usually at the root of most
communication problems. Sometimes it merely causes annoyance or irritation. But when
a person is talking about something important, trying to get a problem resolved, or seeking
emotional support, poor listening can have disastrous results.”
Yet, most of us prefer to talk rather than listen. We enjoy expressing our ideas and
telling what we know and how we feel about things. We expend more energy expressing
our own thoughts rather than giving full attention when others are expressing theirs.
Listening seems like such a simple thing to do; yet, most of us are poor listeners because
listening is hard work.
2. Barriers to Effective Listening

The “bored listener” has heard it all before. When someone rehashes complaints about
his job, you may think, “Here we go again,” and put your brain in neutral. But on
the rare occasion when they say something new and look to you for support and
encouragement, they probably won’t get it.

A “selective listener” picks out bits and pieces of conversation that interest him and
rejects the rest. For instance, you may be doing something while your friend is
talking. Most of what they say goes in one ear and out the other, but when they
mention something that vitally affects you, you become all ears. Other people do
not want to hear anything disagreeable, upsetting or different. We do not gain
anything by rejecting what we do not wish to hear. In many situations we need all
the facts in order to make a decision.

A “defensive listener” twists everything said into a personal attack on self.

Those who interrupt spend their time forming a reply to what they hear; they do not pay
close attention to what is being said. Interested only in their own ideas, they pay
little attention to the words of others and wait only for a split second when they can
break in with, “Oh, that’s nothing. You should hear what...” Or, “That reminds me
of...”
3. Effective Methods of Listening
Emphasis on effective listening is not new, but until recently more emphasis has
been placed on the ability and willingness to speak freely than on effective listening.
Today, however, some schools teach listening skills along with the “three R’s.”
Corporations are encouraging employees to take certain courses to improve their listening
skills. Family counselors are teaching people to listen within the family circle. Following
are some techniques suggested by a collection of experts to help you and your friends
       
enhance your listening abilities.
· Be alert to body language. We communicate by the spoken word, but we also
communicate by what we do not say. Fifty-five percent of what we
communicate is expressed through facial expressions– a pout, a sigh, a
grimace or a squint of the eyes. Such body language speaks louder than
words. Other nonverbal messages are caught through body postures or
gestures– a nervous tapping of the foot, tightly clenched teeth or a motion of
irritation. Such behavior patterns offer keys to feelings behind the words
and set up barriers before conversation begins.
· Be a door-opener. A good listening technique is found in responding with a “door
opener” or the invitation to say more. These responses do not communicate
any of your own ideas or feelings, yet they invite your friend to share their
thoughts. Some of the simplest “door openers” are: “I see.” “You don’t
say.” “Tell me more.” “I’d be interested in your point of view.” “Tell me
the whole story.” In this way you encourage the other person to talk and do
not give the idea that you can hardly wait to snatch the conversation away.
They convey respect by implying: “I might learn something from you. Your
ideas are important to me. I am interested in what you have to say.”
· Listen actively. “Deliberate listening” is the ability to process information,
analyze it, recall it at a later time and draw conclusions from it, but “active
listening” hears the feelings of the speaker first and processes information
secondarily. Both deliberate and active listening skills are necessary in
effective communication, but listening with feeling is far more important in
relationships.
Active listening is particularly useful when you sense your friend has a problem,
such as anger, resentment, loneliness, discouragement, frustration or hurt. Your first
reaction to such feelings may be negative. You may want to argue, defend yourself,
withdraw or fight back. But in active listening you catch what has been said and then
restate what you think the feeling is, not the facts that have been stated.
4. Rules for Effective Listening

Maintain good eye contact. Focus your full attention on your friend.

Sit attentively. For a few minute act as if nothing else in the world
matters except hearing what your friend has to say. Block all other
distractions from your mind. Lean forward in your chair.

Act interested in what you are about to hear. Raise your eyebrows, nod
your head, smile, or laugh when appropriate.

Be attentive and listen with appropriate phrases to show agreement,
interest, and understanding. Your friend wants to know that you
understand the ideas he’s presenting. Try to think through what he
       
is saying and fit it into your own experience.

Ask well-phrased questions. Give encouragement by asking questions
that illustrate your interest.

Listen a little longer. Just when you think you are through listening,
listen.
Personal activity:

Do you have a communication problem? During the next week, focus your
attention not on your friends’ failures but on your own. Being aware is only the first step.
Next, set about to correct the problem. And finally, follow through in an attempt to
upgrade your communication with your friends. If you are uncertain whether a problem
exists, ask your friend what they dislike the most about the way you talk or listen. 
5. Solving Conflicts
Conflicts in relationships are inevitable. People view things differently, and
relationships would be very dull in they didn’t. However, out of these differences
disagreements and conflicts arise that can result in highly emotional states of frustration
and anger.
Often, people view conflict with horror, believing it threatens their relationship. This
misconception causes some to avoid conflict by refusing to acknowledge its presence, by
running from it, and by forcing feelings underground. But ignoring conflicts does not solve
them. In fact, serious problems sometimes develop when problems are bottled up inside
and are not released. A few simple rules can lead to constructive problem-solving.
· Choose the best time and place. It is best to keep calm when handling conflicts,
but if either of you is angry or unreasonable, then postpone the discussion.
Don’t delay it for too long, however, and if your friend does not bring up the
issue again, then you take the initiative to solve the problem. Guard against
unnecessary interruptions when discussing major issues.
· Say it straight. State your feelings openly and respectfully through the effective
use of I-messages. Speak directly, clearly and concisely without anger.
Include reasons why you feel the way you do. Explain how you think the
problem can be solved and what is at stake. Speak calmly and in as
controlled a manner as possible, lowering your voice rather than raising it.
· Stay on the subject. Stick with one problem until you solve it. The more
problems brought up at one time, the less likely that any of them will be
solved. Make a rule that additional problems cannot be brought up until the
first one has been dealt with. Avoid dragging up old scores and arguments.
Agree that if the accusation is more than six months old, it is inadmissible
evidence.
       
Show respect. You may not agree with your friend’s position; in fact, you may be
violently opposed. However, you can still respect his right to have his
opinion. Here are some no-no’s: name-calling, wild threats, put-downs
concerning appearance or intelligence, physical violence, yelling and
interrupting. Words spoken in anger can never be recalled. Nothing can
erase the effects of a threatening ultimatum or bitter remarks spoken in
anger. Speak and listen with respect.
· List possible solutions. When feelings have been described constructively and
openly, you will see the issues at stake and work out rational alternatives.
Brainstorm every possible solution, regardless of how far-fetched it may
seem. But do not appraise them at this time.
· Evaluate the solution. Once all available information has been aired, the two of
you can make an intelligent choice as to the course of action most likely to
succeed. Go back through the list and share thoughts on the consequences
as you evaluate each solution.
· Choose the most acceptable solution. Commit yourselves to choosing the solution
closest to meeting the needs of the one hurting the most. This choice may
take a good measure of negotiation and compromise. Winning should not
be the goal, because where there is a winner there must also be a loser, and
no one likes to lose.
Solutions can be reached by one person yielding, by both compromising or
by one giving in to the other rather than just giving in. Take care to see that
one of you does not always do the yielding. It takes two to make a conflict
and two to resolve it. Giving in to another in the midst of conflict takes real
maturity, because in effect, you are admiring that your analysis of the
situation was wrong and that you are now ready to change your mind.
· Implement the decision. Decide who is to do what, where and when. Once you
reach a decision, remember that two persons often perceive agreements
differently. Only friendly negotiation can solve some conflicts. Often if one
gives in, the other feels resentful and may be in a very bad mood for the rest
of the day, refusing to speak. The other person can be just as stubborn.
Each feels justified in supporting his or her own decision. But does it really
matter who is right and who is wrong? Friends who care about each other
should be able to work things out according to how important each one
considers his or her needs at the time. A solution can be reached more
easily when each person is willing to see the problem from the other
person’s viewpoint.
When Your Friend Breaks the Rules:
Although you may try to avoid arguments, you will occasionally be drawn into
them. When you see one coming, you can prevent it by following a simple formula.
Rather than responding with words that throw you into the heat of battle, choose not to
       
argue.
If your friend reads something hostile into a perfectly legitimate request, choose not
to argue but state calmly and reasonably: “I’m sorry it sounded like that. What I meant to
convey is that...”
If your friend has a special gift for sarcasm, tell him openly: “It hurts me to hear
remarks like that about me. I know I do things that hurt you, also, but let’s try to avoid
such things in the future.”
If your friend is a faultfinder, don’t defend yourself. Instead, take notes on your
“sins.” When they have gotten it all off their chest, say something like this: “OK, let’s go
back to the first thing you mentioned. If I’m really at fault here, I’m willing to talk it over
with you. I’ll ask the same of you, too.”
When a friend makes a ridiculous exaggeration, rather than correcting the
statement, try: “I know this upsets you and that you feel it happens too often. I’ll try not to
let it happen again.”
Unfair fighting techniques can destroy a relationship, but when your friend forgets
and breaks the rules, you can learn to stay reasonable. Choose not to argue, but calmly and
quietly confront your friend with the reality of the situation. With controlled aggression,
reassert your own thoughts, feelings and convictions. You can avoid many potential
arguments by choosing not to argue and by responding in a reasonable, concerned and
tactful manner.
C. Feedback

20 minutes
1. Feedback as the Process of Providing Information
( What is feedback?)

Feedback is the process of providing information through which a person can
discover the impact of his actions and words upon individuals or the group.
Since each person’s behavior is their response to another person’s actions and words, as
they interpret them in light of their background, experience, attitudes, values, etc., it is
possible that they often misunderstand or misinterpret your intentions toward them. There
is no way we can truly know what feelings we have aroused in the person unless they tell
you. We may guess, but their feelings are personal, deep inside, beyond our command.
We have no chance of changing what they feel unless the feelings are shared, prompting
you to change your behavior and communicate with them more closely your intended
message. Without feedback, a distortion between your intentions could grow into an
unnecessary argument or disagreement.
       
2. Two Distinct Types/Categories of Feedback

Unplanned Feedback
Unplanned feedback may emerge in a number of ways:
· Conscious– nodding assent
· Unconscious– nodding asleep
· Spontaneous– “Thanks a lot”
· Solicited– “Yes, it did help”
· Verbal– “No”
· Nonverbal– leaving the room
· Informal– hand-clapping

Planned Feedback
· Reflection– The group appoints a process observer who does not engage in
the group task but watches how the group goes about its task and for
the impact of different actions by group members. The group allows
time for him to ask questions about things that seem significant to
him. The group reflects and discusses these situations as they wish.
· Self-analysis– Tape recorders or video tapes are used, and the person has
an opportunity to hear or see the impact of his behavior on others.
· Coaching– A fellow member observes another member in action and then
coaches him on how he can be more effective.
· Personal feedback– This is most direct and effective if given with the
intention of helping. A number of guidelines have been developed
to help in giving and receiving feedback.
3. Getting Help from Feedback

Reinforces-- Feedback may confirm behavior by encouraging its repetition.
“You really helped when you clarified.”

Correction-- Feedback can help bring behavior in line with intention. “It would
have helped me more if you had stood up to talk.”

Identifies-- Feedback may help identify persons and their relationships. “Joe, I
thought we were enemies, but we’re not, are we?”

Descriptive-- It is descriptive rather than evaluative. By describing one’s own
reaction, it leaves the individual free to use information as he sees
fit. By avoiding evaluative language, it reduces the need for the
individual to react defensively.

Specific--
It is specific rather than general. To be told that one is
“dominating” will probably not be as useful as to be told, “Just now
when we were deciding the issue, you did not listen to what others
said, and I felt forced to accept your arguments or face attack from
you.”

Appropriate-- It takes into account the needs of both the receiver and giver of
       
       
feedback and can be destructive when it serves only our own needs
and fails to consider the needs of the other person.

Usable--
It is directed toward behavior which the receiver can do something
about. Frustration is only increased when a person is reminded of
some short coming over which he has no control.

Requested-- It is solicited rather than imposed. Feedback is most useful when
the receiver himself has formulated the kind of question which those
observing him can answer.

Timely--
It is well-timed. In general, feedback is most useful at the earliest
opportunity after the behavior (depending, of course, on the person’s
readiness to hear it, support available from others, etc.).

Clear--
It is checked to insure clear communication. One way of doing
this is to have the receiver try to rephrase the feedback he has
received to see if it corresponds to what the sender had in mind.

Accurate-- When feedback is given in a training group, both giver and
receiver have opportunity to check with others in the group the
accuracy of the feedback. Is this one man’s impression or an
impression shared by others?
4. When Feedback Can Best Be Given
· In an atmosphere of trust where there is a trusting, warm relationship.
· With concern for the other person as an individual.
· In small bits.
· By being sensitive to its reception.
· When it is timely and appropriate.
· As experience rather than supposition or interpretation.
· When motivated by accepting affectionate, helping impulses.
· When it is specific and derives from the group experience.
· When it is kept within the group.
· When it is requested and wanted.
5. When Feedback Can Best Be Received
· When one is open and ready to receive it, as when it is requested.
· When one is ready to change.
· From a person who is respected by the receiver.
· When one’s filters are bypassed as much as possible.
· When one is least defensive.
· When it is verified by others in the group.
· When one feels trusting of the group.
· When it does not violate one’s personal integrity.
· When one is free to reject it if they wish.
       
When it is truly meant to be helpful and not punitive.
· When it is directed toward behavior one is able to change.
· When it describes what the person is doing rather than placing a value
upon it.
For example– “When you yell at me, it makes me feel that I don’t want to
talk to you anymore,” rather than–“It’s awful for you to yell at me.”
6. How To More Effectively Give and Receive Feedback
· Have deeper personal relationships.
· Have more satisfying personal relationships.
· Learn of one’s impact on others.
· Increase the validity of one’s communication.
· Align self-image with reality.
· Become more open to new experiences.
· Become more unique or differentiated as an individual.
7. Feedback Process
Leveling– Letting another person or persons know how I feel about myself.
“I feel tired.” “I feel bored.” “I feel happy.”
Confrontation– Letting another person or persons know how I feel about them.
“I’m trying to be helpful by explaining it.” “When you... I feel cut
off.”
Encounter– A relationship of dialogue between persons in which both are leveling
and confronting.
8. The Feedback Model
Helpful feedback requires a person to be aware and in control of his
feelings. A model for giving feedback is “When you... (state behavior), I
feel...” This provides data for the other person or group without arousing
their defenses and leaves them free to deal with it as they choose.

                 content: `


15 minutes
Individual class requirements form a part of a total package of information and
experiences designed to encourage participants to develop their full potential. Each
requirement generally allows for a variety of teaching methods. However, teachers need
not feel restricted in teaching the requirements. A good teacher will evaluate the
requirement, class, venue, and other factors, and then choose the most effective teaching
method, including the use of appropriate teaching aids.
Teachers need to be aware of the value in developing effective teaching resources that they
can use to assist them in completing the requirements. They need to assess what they have
on hand, what they can call on, and what they may need to find in order to meet their
needs.
1. Types of Resources
There are many places where teaching resources may be found:

Personnel– People are one of the most valuable resources to the club leader.
Many people have chosen a specialist profession or career and are often
more than ready to share their expertise. Doctors, engineers, nurses, and
trades people may, and should, be used to teach selected requirements.
Teachers may be able to find members of their church or community who
have a special interest in some area of life-- e.g., social concerns, nature,
etc. Others may have an interesting hobby or craft which they can share.
Some people may have chosen a special area of study and may be willing to
share in specialized classes-- e.g., church history, sex and dating, church
doctrines, etc.
These people are valuable resource personnel! A personal presentation by
these specialists will probably be the most effective and helpful to the class
situation. However, teachers should remember that a cassette or CD, video,
or other audiovisual will also serve the purpose if a person cannot be there
in person.

Places– Most clubs will be close to many venues that can provide excellent
       
resources for classwork. Schools, both primary and secondary, may be able
to offer assistance. Tertiary-level schools often have small research
museums available. Specialized clubs, libraries, hospitals, government
offices, and special training centers may also be available. Museums, art
galleries, and culture centers can often help the enquiring teacher. Parks,
gardens, factories, and tourist bureaus may offer excellent materials– just
the things to make the class a real winner.

Materials– Teachers should also recognize the value of the written word.
Books and articles are probably the handiest source for information and
pictures; magazines and periodicals are also valuable in this area.
Videos, cassettes, CD’s, DVD’s, and the Internet are popular and valuable
as teaching resources. Teachers need to keep a current file of what is
available from video companies and rental stores and select appropriate
materials to fit the various requirements and their objectives.
2. Factors That Affect Resource Selection
There are several factors that should be considered when choosing resources for a
particular class or lesson theme:

Venue– The place where you meet regularly for your program will have some
bearing on your choice of resources. If you meet in a large open hall with
lots of room, you will be able to use certain types of resources that would be
less effective in a small, crowded room. If you can’t darken your room for
showing films, they cease to be an important resource. On the other hand, if
a particular film is critical to your program, you will need to find another
suitable meeting place for the occasion.
It may also be important to evaluate the security of your room and consider
whether the hall has enough space and security for all your material
resources.

Number of participants– The number of participants in your care will also
affect the number and style of resources you use. If your class is small, you
will not need as many resources as you might need for a larger class.
However, variety and creativity are extremely important, and you need to
provide as many new experiences for your class as possible.

Qualifications and experience– If you have been assigned to teach a class, your
choice and selection of resources will probably reflect your experience in
the teaching area. If you are a new teacher, you may be unsure just where to
       
start! You may need to call on more experienced teachers and get their
guidance and help. Ask them, as resource people, to take some segments
for you. You may be able to find a qualified school teacher who can help
you select materials.
3. Developing a Resource File
When you, as the teacher, see the area you need to care for, you can then start
building a resource file that can be expanded each time you discover something new.
Write down any ideas you get and file them away. When you see a book that you think
would be valuable, ask your club to purchase it for you. Copy down the names of any good
films you see, speakers you hear, and games you play. Even if you can’t use a particular
resource immediately, it may eventually be just what you need. Keeping a current file of
great things and ideas is an invaluable practice.
C. How to Develop Creative Worships

55 minutes
At the heart of every Christian is a relationship– a relationship with Jesus Christ.
This relationship will usually be expressed in some form of praise, often with a group of
people who think about Jesus in a similar way. We usually call it worship, because it
centers around a person’s need to be alive and dynamic. Participants will value and enjoy
their involvement in praise and celebration if they sense that someone has put effort into
making it fun and meaningful.

Enjoyable worship periods address two major factors– attitudes and creativity.
1. Developing Positive Attitudes Toward Worship
Young people need to learn things besides facts and skills– they need to develop
healthy attitudes. Attitudes largely determine what youth learn. Attitudes determine not
only a person’s willingness to learn but also how the knowledge will be used. Since a
teacher’s goal is to provide knowledge that young people can and will use, being sensitive
to attitudes is critical.
Developing positive attitudes is a fundamental concern for the teacher for many reasons:

No one can be forced to learn anything if he/she does not want to learn.

Even if people learn and discover important things, the primary concern of
continuing learning is lost when they do not develop positive attitudes.

Vocational choices are largely dependent on attitudes.

Application of ideas, in a large measure, depends on positive attitudes.

Positive attitudes will reflect favorably on the teacher and on the club as a whole.
       
The basic way to help individuals develop positive attitudes toward worship is to
provide pleasant experiences for learning about God, themselves, their world and their
church. We are all willing to give time, effort and money to activities that we enjoy. We
avoid and put off those things that are unpleasant. Our favorite activities are usually ones
we do successfully and comfortably and that bring us in contact with people we enjoy. The
implication for teachers is clear! Worship needs to be an enjoyable time– able to provide
good memories.
Further, the teacher’s outlook on worship as an important, dynamic, and valuable time must
be real and genuine; his/her attitude toward his class members must be sympathetic and
understanding; their interest in learning must be great; and their enthusiasm for teaching
must be sincere. If the teacher’s attitudes or interests are less favorable or the same as those
of the student, no one will generate enthusiasm, and genuine creative worship demands
enthusiasm.
Teachers will learn to make worship more significant and develop greater positive attitudes
to worship by setting out to:
· Develop an appreciation for the nature of worship. Understanding its
components, its themes, and its focal point, who is God.
· Nourish curiosity in all aspects of worship. Provide opportunities to discover new
ideas; make each worship time significant for the participants; assign openended questions and problems for thought and exploration.
· Build loyalty and confidence in God. Be a person people can accept and want to
associate with; work with patience and kindness so that time spent together
is meaningful and successful.
· Make worship times a pleasure. Present the material so that it can be understood;
use a variety of materials and methods that provide student participation in
discovery and discussion.
· Nourish respect for worship times. Stress the times and things the participants
involve themselves in during worship periods; avoid punishing or
humiliating them in worship settings.
2. Creativity in Worship
Worship offers unique opportunities for creative and original thinking. It centers on
a relationship, and there are endless ways to strengthen and deepen relationships. Teachers
will discover a freshness and excitement in the club’s worship segments if they have room
for creative activities.
The leader can encourage members to investigate and explore by providing materials,
topics, problems, reading matter, games, etc. Any discovery in an individual’s relationship
with God should be recognized and encouraged. Often, members need time and solitude to
bring creativeness to the surface, and freedom for independent work and expression should
be provided in the worship periods whenever possible. It is important, too, that the
“climate” makes the individual feel their qualities are valued by other members of the
group, as well as by the teacher, and feels enough confidence in his relationship with others
to be different and express his own ideas.
If students are only given facts and rules in worship, then the teacher has no reason to
expect creative thinking. If teachers think there is only one solution to a problem or only
one way to describe an idea, then class members will have little or no incentive to be
creative. The following principles of teaching are well worth considering when making
plans for worship occasions. Teachers ought to check that:

Students are actively looking for concepts through reflective thinking, problem
solving, experimentation with new experiences, and analysis.

Students are encouraged to ask questions, discuss different opinions, and
propose new ideas with their classmates.

Students are encouraged to give reasons for answers, statements, methods.

They have materials, illustrations, and lesson objects that will enhance the
students’ understanding of a concept or idea.

They show enthusiasm for the class members and their different ideas.
3. Places and Times of Worship
Worship happens in many places and occasions within the club program. Doing
something different, unique, special, and making it enjoyable isn’t going to be easy every
time; in fact, it may not be easy at all! Many teachers will need to take time and effort to do
something out of the ordinary, but it’s worth it! There is a real need for committed teachers
and leaders who will be prepared to do all that is necessary to make worship for club
members a most enjoyable and valuable time.
4. Developing a Creative Approach to Worship Preparation
There are several principles that the teacher can keep in mind when preparing a
worship period:

Accept the challenge of doing it differently from the way it is usually done. If
your worship has followed a set pattern, try a new way of presenting the
same material. Rearrange the segments. Assess the value of each
component, and find a better way of sharing the ideas.

Be imaginative. Picture the details of the story you’re planning to tell– the
details of the time, place, personnel, etc. Imagine the feelings, the
atmosphere, the fears, the excitement. Relive the occasion and then attempt
to carry some of those feelings into your worship time. Recreate the
       
atmosphere through drama, mime, music, and dress.

Look at the idea from a variety of angles! Ask how, when, where, and why–
what was and was not said. Seek parallels, modify, magnify, rearrange.
Take one idea at a time and follow it through to a conclusion. Then tie
everything together.

Include opportunities for participation. Individuals need to be involved, and
worship should actively involve them as much as possible.

Make application to the present. It’s the now that the worship is speaking to.
People need to deal with the current times, and all worship should have
something to say for today.
The following selection of material provides just some ideas for alternative
worships. They might/should spark ideas in your mind for greater ways of making worship
all that it can be.

           title: 'Developing Creativity Through AY Honors',
                 content: `


30 minutes
1. Purpose of Teaching AY Honors
The Adventist Youth/Pathfinder (AY) Honors have one objective: to develop the
physical, mental, and spiritual capacities of the youth or adult.
The first 16 AY Honors were introduced in 1928; since then, more than 240 honors have
been added to the program. Students study honors to obtain awards for knowledge,
proficiency, and life skills. In preparing to receive the honor, the participating person,
group, or family unit will experience fun through creativity and achievement.
Each AY Honor is designed to introduce a practical subject that aids the person’s
development as a Christian by affecting the social, emotional, physical and spiritual aspects
of his life. Studying AY Honors should direct a person to a deeper love of his heavenly
Creator and increase his interest in committing his life to God and community. All honors
are designed to help students “increase in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and
man.”
Honor study is designed to help the person’s spiritual character development, and every
honor requires high standards of excellence by clearly stating what tasks are to be
accomplished. Fulfilling the requirements should be interesting and fun while instilling a
sense of achievement.
The study of an AY Honor should provide the person with an attractive way to learn about
his surroundings or widen his exposure to new horizons or adventures. Such study topics
might include learning about hobbies, special interests, or being introduced to a new
vocation. An interested, devoted student could complete an entire honor in less than three
months.
Because AY honors are part of a church-sponsored program, all facets of course study
should harmonize with basic church standards. For this reason, honor study avoids topics
requiring the destruction of plant or animal life, or types of armed or unarmed defense.
Each honor also has broad appeal, avoiding subjects that could be studied by only a small
group of people in a single local area.
The AY Honors enable young people to gain proficiency in many areas. Sometimes honor
study leads to the adoption of a vocation or at least a useful hobby. Some students think the
AY Honors are just a lot of study, theory, and book work; they forget that each honor is
based on the philosophy: “An ounce of theory to a pound of patience.”
2. Exploring the Interests and Creativity of the Individual  
Through the years, the Master Guide program has developed into the leadership track for
the Pathfinder Club; the AY Honors have likewise become one of the two basic support
columns of the Pathfinder curriculum. Although these two are primarily focused on the
club, they are not exclusive to it. Anyone who desires to expand their horizons through
these two programs is welcome to do so.
There are tremendous possibilities within the framework of the AY Honors. To gain the
maximum benefit from the AY Honor program, it is essential for Pathfinder Club directors
and church youth leaders to keep the following five suggestions in mind:
· High Standards– As youth leaders, keep the AY Honor standard high. That’s
where it belongs. Do not permit careless work, and make sure you set a good example. AY
Honors are top-value features. Keep them there.
· Serious Study– Encourage serious, not monotonous, study of AY Honor
requirements. Make it interesting and pleasant for the participant. Let it be real,
worthwhile fun. Enjoy it yourself, and make sure you put the ideas across so they stick in
their minds.
· Real Interest– Encourage youth to search beyond the requirements for the
particular AY Honor. Add points of interest outside the minimum requirements. Get them
really interested in meeting the requirements.
· Worthy Recognition– Be sure successful candidates receive their AY Honor
certificates and/or patches as soon as possible and at a service worthy of the effort they
have expended.
· Wide Choice– Demonstrate various crafts frequently. Until they see a
demonstration, many youth don’t even know that some AY Honors exist or how interesting
they can be. There are eight categories of AY Honors available for study, representing
fields of interest for any youth or adult.
AY Honors will transform the Pathfinder Club or youth group into an interesting workshop
where youth can learn to serve their church in many ways.
Requirement limitations: Much effort has gone into evaluating all the requirements for each
honor, assuring its timeliness, usefulness, and applicability in a world-wide program.
However, there may be requirements occasionally that are irrelevant to a particular setting
or not possible due to personal limitations, etc. When this occurs, the requirement should
not dropped but rather be substituted with a requirement of equal strength.
3. Teaching AY Honors
Some AY Honors require special highly-skilled instructors. All learning must, in
those cases, be carried on under careful supervision by a person or persons clearly qualified
to teach the material. These honors are so indicated in the honor handbook. The instructor
may be any person in the church, school, or community whose expertise qualifies them.
       
When the person is not a church member, they should be carefully informed of our lifestyle,
as well as the concepts and requirements that need to be covered. Each honor has an

3. Pathfinder Ministries
	
Mission Statement:
The __________________________Pathfinder Ministries is an organization of the
(Name of your field/Conference)
Seventh-day Adventist Church, dedicated to meeting the social, physical, mental, and
spiritual needs of junior and teen youth by challenging the Pathfinder to experience a
personal relationship with Christ, having a sense of achievement and responsibility, and
developing respect for God’s creation including his fellow man.
∇ Goals:
Pathfinder Ministries seeks to meet the Pathfinder’s present and unfolding needs, to
the end that we bring them to self-fulfillment and maturity in Christian faith, characterized
by their decision to:


Accept Jesus Christ as personal Saviour and Lord.

Reflect internalized Christian values through mature decision-making and
behavior.

Exhibit the righteousness, true holiness, and fullness of stature of Christ.

Demonstrate leadership skills, enabled and empowered to become full partners in
active, selfless service supporting the mission of the church.
The basic Adventurer, Pathfinder, and Youth philosophies require leaders to:

Help the youth to understand that the church loves them, cares for them, and
appreciates them. They should know that they are needed in its total
program.

Share with club members the destiny that God has planned for each of them and
expand the knowledge of their part in the great plan of salvation. Help them
want to live up to God’s expectation for their lives.

Train and organize youth for active service. Teach them that witnessing is not a
once-a-week or once-a-month project, but that it should be incorporated into
their everyday lives.

Work for the salvation of each individual.

Understand the purpose of God’s assignment to man.

40 minutes
Note: Present the Doctrine of Spiritual Gifts. Allow participants to discover their own spiritual gifts.
Objective:
To enable the leader to appreciate that all individuals are different both in personality and
in talent and that God has a place in His work for each one.
       
Explanation:
Each person has natural talents and skills that are acquired, but God also gives spiritual
gifts to each one. The leader not only needs to understand the Biblical principles of the
doctrine of spiritual gifts, but should also have access to tools that will enable him to help
young people to identify their own gifts and encourage them to use these in a way that not
only gives enjoyment but also promotes spiritual growth.

What is a Spiritual Gift? 
Is there a difference between a spiritual gift and a talent? Is it important to recognize the
difference? Will it help me discover my own spiritual gifts if I can distinguish between the
two?
The answer to all three is Yes! And recognizing the differences between talents and
spiritual gifts can be one of the keys to finding those spiritual gifts God has given to you.
Let’s look at talents, or natural abilities. A natural ability may be something you’re born
with, like physical coordination. Or it may be a talent you’ve developed through the years,
such as playing a musical instrument. These natural abilities or talents may be useful or
entertaining. But they deal primarily with the surface of life. The root concern of one’s
relationship to God is left untouched. Abilities and talents affect people on a temporary
basis, not an eternal basis. And, spiritual growth isn’t necessary for their development.
A woman who frequently opens her home for dinner guests and social gatherings may not
have the gift of hospitality. Why not? Because spiritual gifts differ from natural abilities in
two important respects:
1) The motivation for the gift is based on love for God and love for humanity. Selfglory or gain can never be the incentive. Paul tells us that one’s communication,
knowledge, and faith might all be perfect, but they are worthless unless love is the motive
(1 Cor. 13:1-3).
2) The goal of spiritual gifts differs from that of natural abilities. Spiritual gifts are
granted “for the common good,” “to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building
up the body of Christ” (1 Cor. 12:7; Eph. 4:12).
Keep in mind this motivation and goal as you seek to discover your gifts. Ask yourself,
“What is my motivation and goal in this area?” Remind yourself that these gifts form the
basis for our individual and collective service for God.
(Remember, too, that hardly anyone discovers all his/her gifts at the beginning of the
Christian experience. A period of time or a special set of circumstances may be required to
bring your gifts to light. Be willing to try your hand in new areas. Your spiritual gifts can
be confirmed only in the actual setting where they are put to use.)

Spiritual Gifts in the Church 
God has placed within the church various gifts, which have been given to each one of us to
perform our work of ministry.
	
Three Key Passages Concerning Spiritual Gifts:
Eph. 4:7-13; 1Cor. 12:1-11, 28-31; Rom. 12:1-8
	
Ellen G. White References Concerning Spiritual Gifts:
COL 327: possession of gifts depends on reception of Spirit
9T 144,145: contrast must not hinder unity
GW 481: different gifts placed in church
DA 823: not all imparted to every believer
COL 328: poorest and most ignorant believer may have gifts
COL 327: promised to every servant of Christ
Ev 256: subject frequently neglected
6T 291-293: unity and cooperation essential in use of gifts
	
Definition of Spiritual Gifts
A spiritual gift is a special ability given to a member of the body of Christ
by the Holy Spirit that enables him/her to work effectively with joy in
helping the church carry out its mission in the world.
Do not confuse:
Spiritual Gifts with natural talents– All people, whether Christians
or not, have natural talents. Only Christians receive spiritual gifts.
These gifts enable the Christian to minister in such a way that He
will have a power that will tell upon hearts.
Spiritual Gifts with fruit of the Spirit– (Gal. 5:22, 23). The fruit of
the Spirit is reproduced in each Christian by the Holy Spirit. All
Christians are to have all of the fruits of the Spirit, but not every
spiritual gift is given to every Christian.
Spiritual Gifts with Christian roles– I may be an evangelist, while
someone else has the gift of teaching; yet we are all witnesses (Acts
1:8). Witnessing is not a special gift of the Spirit given to select
persons. It is a role that all Christians share. Every Christian is to
show and tell what Christ through His Word and Spirit has done in
his/her own heart and life.
Genuine Gifts with Counterfeits– The devil always has a counterfeit
for that which is genuine. Counterfeit gifts are more often associated
with the more directly miraculous, such as miracles, healings,
speaking in tongues, and prophecy. Being more spectacular, they
have greater power to catch attention. Miracle working is one of the
signs of the end. Manifestations of this order must be carefully
tested by the church, for there will be miracles on both the side of
truth and the side of error in the last days. Only by the Scriptures can
they be tested.
	
List of Spiritual Gifts
1) Administration– The ability to organize, manage, and supervise working
with and through others to achieve goals. Its meaning is “to steer,”
as the helmsman or pilot of a ship. The ability to plan and launch
projects, to meet the needs of God’s cause.
2) Apostleship– This is a title not normally used in church today. However,
it means to be sent out, especially commissioned to represent the
church in a broader ministry. This gift may be represented today by
the spirit-given ability to begin the work that may lead to new
churches being established.
3) Discernment– The analytical capacity to discern between truth and error,
right and wrong.
4) Evangelism– The ability to so persuasively present the gospel of Jesus
that people are led to become His disciples.
5) Exhortation– This word is derived from the same word that Jesus used for
the Comforter (Holy Spirit), one who comes alongside to encourage.
Also, it is the ability to stimulate people to action in the service of
God.
6) Faith– The ability to see a vision of what God wants done and the
unswerving confidence to accomplish it regardless of the obstacles.
7) Giving– The ability to share personal assets with joy and eagerness so that
people are helped and God’s work is advanced.
8) Helps– The ability to unselfishly meet the needs of others through some
type of practical help. The exercise of this gift often releases those
with teaching and preaching gifts to minister the word of God.
9) Hospitality– The ability to open one’s home graciously so that guests are
put at ease and are refreshed both physically and spiritually.
10) Intercession– The practice of praying earnestly and sincerely on behalf
of others and their special needs.
11) Knowledge– The ability to easily master a body of truth. It is also the
ability to store and recall a fund of knowledge from God’s Word to
meet the need at hand.
12) Leadership– The ability to inspire and lead others in various ministries
within the body of Christ. This gift is exercised with the attitude of a
servant.
13) Serving– The unusual desire and capacity to render service to others.
       14) Mercy– The capacity to feel sympathy with those in need (especially
those who are suffering and miserable) and to manifest this sympathy
in some practical way with a cheerful spirit so as to encourage and
help those in need.
15) Missionary– The ability to minister across cultures.
16) Pastoring– (Shepherding) The ability to shepherd, counsel, and
encourage believers in their walk with Christ and in their service to
the church and community.
17) Prophecy– Primarily this refers to the gift bestowed on one who is called
to receive divine revelation from God to be communicated to man.
Secondarily, to the capacity to preach so that the Bible comes alive to
the hearer.
18) Teaching– The ability to instruct and explain the Bible truths so clearly
in such a detailed way that those willing to learn will understand.
19) Wisdom– The ability to penetrate into a matter, seeing the situation in its
larger relationships, and imparting wise counsel from God’s Word.

    <p><strong>Church Heritage Mock Exam - March 25, 2024</strong></p>
    <p>A mock exam in Church Heritage was conducted on March 25, 2024, across our two Zones. The exams were held at Lukanga SDA Church in Zone A and Rockside SDA Church in Zone B. A total of 16 candidates participated in these assessments, with only 3 candidates successfully passing. This results in a pass rate of 18.75%.</p>

    <p><strong>MEZC Final Exams - April 7, 2024</strong></p>
    <p>The final exams organized by Midlands East Zambia Conference (MEZC) were held on April 7, 2024, at Kabwe Adventist School (KAS) and Rockside SDA Church. The KAS center accommodated 10 candidates, while Rockside had 18 candidates. Out of the 28 candidates who sat for the exams, a commendable 20 candidates successfully passed. This results in a pass rate of approximately 71.43%.</p>

    <p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
    <p>It is with great pleasure that we acknowledge the improvement in participant numbers and pass rates in these assessments. The increase in successful candidates reflects the dedication and commitment of the participants and the effectiveness of the preparation and support provided by our leaders in various churches.</p>

    <p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
    <p>For those who did not succeed in these assessments and others who wish to sit for the same exams, it is important to continue preparing diligently. The education team is preparing to request another exam session from the conference to provide further opportunities for candidates to demonstrate their knowledge and skills.</p>

    <p>We encourage all interested parties to engage actively in their studies and take advantage of the upcoming exam opportunity to showcase their understanding of Church Heritage.</p>
