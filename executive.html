        <h3>Opening Remarks</h3>
        <p>The chair person welcomed the members and apologized for his late coming due to other duties.</p>
        <p>The chair person informed the house that the meeting was supposed to be attended by both zone A and zone B executive members. However, this was not possible because most of zone A executive members attended the camp fire at Nabusanga SDA Church and they thought it wise to conduct the meeting there with the same agenda.</p>
        <p>The chair person further encouraged members to feel free to air out their views during the meeting.</p>
    

        <h3>Main Business</h3>
        <h4>Camp Meeting</h4>
        <p>The District Administration this year intends to give the youth ministries department activities to do at the camp meeting. As it noted that youths do not fully participate at the camp meeting in activities such as music and lessons.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it was resolved that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There's need to encourage youth singing bands in our various churches to camp.</li>
            <li>Also during camp meeting youths to form a mass choir.</li>
            <li>Youths need to come up with educative activities they intend to teach during camp meeting, and they should be shared in the executive group as soon as possible. So that it should be easy for the administration to find where they can place our activities on the lota.</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h4>Time Management Activities</h4>
        <p>Upcoming activities in the month of July:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>21st July Adventurer sports day and tour.</li>
            <li>28th July Assessments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Discussion on why the executive is failing to follow the Time Management:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaders do not make efforts to ensure proper Time Management.</li>
            <li>Waiting for the executive to permit the leaders to conduct the activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resolutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaders should consistently check the Time Management.</li>
            <li>Leaders should not wait for the executive to tell them to conduct the activities. Leaders should be the ones to organize and thereafter engage the executive.</li>
            <li>Leaders should work together and engage with other leaders in events where they do not know what to do.</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h4>Vacancies/Elections</h4>
        <p>The following vacancies were filled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Treasurer: Bridget Mbaso</li>
            <li>Music: Daniel Hachela and Emma Muleya (Vice)</li>
            <li>Adventurer Directors: Wabota Seeta and Emeldah Chisenga (Vice)</li>
            <li>Ambassador Leader: Maimbo Malambo</li>
            <li>Planning/Project: Godfrey Mweene</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h4>Invitation from Lusaka North Mission District</h4>
        <p>The executive accepted that the youths from Lusaka North Mission District should visit KEMD in October. The executive also seconded to the proposed date by the pastor, which was 19th October, 2024.</p>

              
        <h4>Certificates under Education</h4>
        <p>The house did not accept the certificates of participation for Adventurer Skills and Arts Day.</p>
        <p>Reasons for refusal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the sign slot there was KEMD Youth Director which is not supposed to be there.</li>
            <li>There was an omission of the position of the KEMD Education Chair.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resolutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since the Adventurer directors claimed that it was the printing personnel that made the mistake, yet they gave them a correct format, there was a need for the printing to redesign the certificates at their own cost.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, there was a need to neatly cancel or correct the mistake because the certificates will be used as a reference in the future, e.g., in compiling portfolios.</li>
            <li>Note: The issuing and designing of certificates should pass through the education chair or committee.</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h3>Executive Operations</h3>
        <h4>Problems</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of support from other leaders.</li>
            <li>Lack of communication and commitment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Solutions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All leaders in all departments should mobilize or put in much effort.</li>
            <li>Leaders should have personal sacrifice.</li>
            <li>Leaders should create a friendly environment for everyone.</li>
            <li>Leaders should visit churches and check up on one another.</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h3>A.O.B. (Any Other Business)</h3>
        <h4>Recommendations under Education</h4>
        <p>Education would like to have a committee and also come up with a mentorship program.</p>
        <p>When there is a conference or district education program, the district should at least sponsor one education committee member to attend the program.</p>
        <p>Other recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zone B executive proposed that the return match for Zone B Ambassadors to visit Zone A should be on the 14th September, 2024.</li>
            <li>Minimize the activities on the district Time Management, thereby giving space for local church programs.</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h3>Announcements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There will be Zone B youth music fellowship on 4th August, 2024, at Green Leaf Church. Therefore, each church is requested to pay K100 whether the church participates or not.</li>
            <li>There is a need to identify capable sponsors for KEMD youth department.</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
        <p>The chair person thanked everyone who attended the meeting. He encouraged the members:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To pray for one another.</li>
            <li>Stop blame games.</li>
            <li>Stop seeing oneself more superior than the other.</li>
            <li>Check up on one another.</li>
            <li>Utilize the WhatsApp group for example, sharing Bible verses.</li>
            <li>Come up with activities that will boost our cofer.</li>
            <li>Be entrepreneurs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The chair further encouraged the members to enforce the activities on the Time Management in order to leave a legacy. Lastly, he ended by quoting from the book of Proverbs 16:1.</p>
