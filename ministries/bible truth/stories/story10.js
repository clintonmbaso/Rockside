  <h2>Lesson 40 - The Body Temple</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Our Bodies as Temples of God</h3>
  <p>
    Our bodies are considered the <strong>temples of God</strong> because of both creation and redemption. This teaching is clearly stated in Scripture:
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 6:19-20:</strong> “Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.”
    <br>
    This means our bodies belong to God and should be respected as such.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Our Obligation to Keep the Body for God</h3>
  <p>
    Since our bodies belong to God, we are under an obligation to keep them <strong>holy and dedicated</strong> for His purpose. We should yield our bodies to God as a living sacrifice:
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 12:1:</strong> “I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. Ways the Body Temple Can Be Defiled</h3>
  <p>
    The body temple may be defiled through various actions and choices that are contrary to God's will. Here are some ways the body can be defiled:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>By what we eat and drink:</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>Daniel 1:8:</strong> “But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine that he drank.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>By impure thoughts:</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>Jude 8:</strong> “Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>By consuming strong drink:</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>Leviticus 10:8-10:</strong> “And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying, ‘Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die.’”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>By impurity in persons and drunkenness:</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>1 Corinthians 6:9-10:</strong> “Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>By harmful food or drink:</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>Judges 13:4:</strong> “Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean.”
        <br>
        The statement "Abstinence from all hurtful food and drink is the fruit of true religion" (GW 348) suggests that we should avoid things that harm our bodies, which God designed to be His temple.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>4. Honoring God with Our Body</h3>
  <p>
    As Christians, our actions, including eating and drinking, should be done in a way that <strong>honors God</strong>:
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 10:31:</strong> “So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.”
  </p>

  <h3>5. Sanctification of the Body</h3>
  <p>
    The Lord expects us to be <strong>sanctified in body</strong> as we prepare for His return. This involves being wholly devoted to Him:
    <br>
    <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:23:</strong> “Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
    <br>
    <strong>2 Corinthians 7:1:</strong> “Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.”
  </p>

  <h3>6. Temperance and Self-Control</h3>
  <p>
    The Christian life requires <strong>temperance</strong> and <strong>self-control</strong>, especially in relation to our bodily appetites and desires:
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 9:25-27:</strong> “Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.”
    <br>
    This illustrates the importance of self-discipline to keep the body in check and to avoid defilement.
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The body is a sacred vessel, and as Christians, we are called to honor it, keeping it holy for God's purposes. The principles of temperance, sanctification, and avoiding defilement are central to maintaining our bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit.
  </p>

Lesson 40 - The Body Temple
Date: Wednesday, April 05, 2023

1. Our Bodies as Temples of God
Our bodies are considered the temples of God because of both creation and redemption. This teaching is clearly stated in Scripture. In 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, it says, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body." This means that our bodies belong to God and should be treated with respect.

2. Our Obligation to Keep the Body for God
Since our bodies belong to God, we are obligated to keep them holy and dedicated for His purposes. We are called to present our bodies as a living sacrifice. Romans 12:1 tells us, "I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship."

3. Ways the Body Temple Can Be Defiled
The body temple can be defiled through actions and choices that go against God's will. These include:

What we eat and drink. For example, Daniel 1:8 says, “But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine that he drank.”

Impure thoughts, as seen in Jude 8, “Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh...”

Consuming strong drinks. Leviticus 10:8-10 warns, "Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die."

Impurity and drunkenness, as 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 cautions, “Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?”

Harmful food or drink, as suggested in Judges 13:4, “Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean.” We should avoid things that harm our bodies, which God designed to be His temple.


4. Honoring God with Our Body
As Christians, everything we do, including eating and drinking, should be done in a way that honors God. 1 Corinthians 10:31 reminds us, "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."

5. Sanctification of the Body
The Lord expects us to be sanctified in body as we prepare for His return. This means being wholly devoted to Him. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says, “Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Additionally, 2 Corinthians 7:1 calls us to cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.

6. Temperance and Self-Control
The Christian life requires temperance and self-control, especially in relation to bodily desires. In 1 Corinthians 9:25-27, Paul says, “Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.” This passage illustrates the importance of self-discipline in maintaining the purity of our bodies.

Notes
The body is a sacred vessel, and as Christians, we are called to honor it by keeping it holy for God's purposes. The principles of temperance, sanctification, and avoiding defilement are essential to maintaining our bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit.

  <h2>Lesson 41 - Healthful Living</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. God's Interest in Physical Well-being</h3>
  <p>
    God is deeply concerned with the <strong>physical well-being</strong> of His people and is not the author of sickness.
    <br>
    <strong>3 John 2:</strong> "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."
    <br>
    This verse reveals that God desires His followers to be in good health, demonstrating His care for their well-being.
  </p>

  <h3>2. God's Provision for Food</h3>
  <p>
    In alignment with His desire for His people to be healthy, God has provided specific guidelines regarding food, encouraging the consumption of what is best suited for human health.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:29:</strong> "And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat."
    <br>
    Initially, God gave man a plant-based diet, which was intended for optimal health.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 9:3:</strong> "Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things."
    <br>
    After the flood, God permitted man to eat flesh, but this was a concession rather than the original intent.
    <br>
    <strong>Exodus 16:35:</strong> "And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan."
    <br>
    When God provided food for Israel, He gave them manna, a non-flesh diet, showing His preference for plant-based nourishment.
    <br>
    <strong>Daniel 1:8-20:</strong> "But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank... As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom."
    <br>
    Daniel chose to avoid the king's flesh foods, and as a result, he and his companions were blessed by God.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Best Food and Forbidden Flesh</h3>
  <p>
    While God permitted man to eat flesh, He indicated that it is not the best food for human health. Additionally, He specifically forbids certain flesh foods.
    <br>
    <strong>Ecclesiastes 10:17:</strong> "Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!"
    <br>
    This verse emphasizes the principle that food should be consumed for strength and vitality, not merely for pleasure or indulgence.
    <br>
    <strong>Deuteronomy 14:1-21:</strong> This passage includes God’s divine evaluation of flesh foods, outlining which animals are clean and unclean.
    <br>
    <strong>Leviticus 11:1-31:</strong> This chapter provides detailed instructions on clean and unclean animals, further indicating which flesh foods should be avoided.
    <br>
    <strong>Deuteronomy 14:8:</strong> "And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you."
    <br>
    The swine (pig) is particularly forbidden, as it is considered an unclean animal according to God’s dietary laws.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Forbidden Drinks</h3>
  <p>
    God is equally particular about what we drink. All harmful drinks, especially alcohol, are strictly forbidden.
    <br>
    <strong>Proverbs 20:1:</strong> "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise."
    <br>
    Wine and strong drink can deceive and lead people away from wisdom.
    <br>
    <strong>Isaiah 28:7:</strong> "But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink..."
    <br>
    Alcohol impairs judgment and leads people into error.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 6:9-10:</strong> "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind... shall inherit the kingdom of God."
    <br>
    Drunkenness is listed among the sins that prevent people from inheriting the kingdom of God.
    <br>
    <strong>Habakkuk 2:15:</strong> "Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also..."
    <br>
    Christians are admonished not to offer harmful drinks to others.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Honoring God with Our Bodies</h3>
  <p>
    Since our physical bodies are considered temples of the Holy Spirit, we honor God by rejecting harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics, which can degrade our physical and mental health.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 6:19-20:</strong> "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s."
    <br>
    Our bodies belong to God, and we are to care for them by avoiding substances that harm our health and hinder our relationship with Him.
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Healthful living is a spiritual responsibility, as God desires that we maintain our physical well-being as a reflection of His care for us. Proper food and drink, along with the rejection of harmful substances, are all part of honoring God with our bodies.
  </p>

Lesson 41 - Healthful Living

God's Interest in Physical Well-being
God is deeply concerned with the physical well-being of His people and is not the author of sickness. In 3 John 2, it is written, "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." This verse shows that God desires His followers to be in good health, demonstrating His care for their well-being.

God's Provision for Food
God has provided specific guidelines for food, encouraging the consumption of what is best suited for human health. In Genesis 1:29, God says, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed... to you it shall be for meat." Initially, God gave mankind a plant-based diet for optimal health. However, after the flood, in Genesis 9:3, He permitted flesh consumption, though this was a concession rather than the original intent. God also provided manna to the children of Israel in Exodus 16:35, demonstrating His preference for plant-based nourishment. Additionally, in Daniel 1:8-20, Daniel chose not to eat the king’s flesh foods, and as a result, he and his companions were blessed by God.

The Best Food and Forbidden Flesh
While God permitted flesh consumption, it was never intended as the best food for health. In Ecclesiastes 10:17, it says, "Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!" God’s guidelines on clean and unclean animals are found in Deuteronomy 14:1-21 and Leviticus 11:1-31. These passages provide instructions on which flesh foods should be avoided. For example, in Deuteronomy 14:8, the swine (pig) is specifically forbidden because it is considered unclean according to God’s dietary laws.

Forbidden Drinks
God is also concerned with what we drink. All harmful drinks, especially alcohol, are strictly forbidden. Proverbs 20:1 warns, "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise." Alcohol impairs judgment and leads people away from wisdom. Isaiah 28:7 speaks about how strong drink leads people into error. In 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, drunkenness is listed among the sins that prevent people from inheriting the kingdom of God. Furthermore, in Habakkuk 2:15, Christians are admonished not to offer harmful drinks to others.

Honoring God with Our Bodies
Our physical bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and we honor God by rejecting harmful substances like alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics. 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 reminds us that our bodies belong to God, and we are to care for them by avoiding substances that harm our health and hinder our relationship with Him.

Notes
Healthful living is a spiritual responsibility, as God desires that we maintain our physical well-being as a reflection of His care for us. Proper food, drink, and the rejection of harmful substances are all part of honoring God with our bodies.
