                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed and hold 
certain Fundamental Beliefs to be the teaching of the Holy Scriptures. These 
beliefs, as set forth here, constitute the church’s understanding and expression 
of the teaching of Scripture. Revision of these statements may be expected at 
a General Conference Session when the church is led by the Holy Spirit to a 
fuller understanding of Bible truth or finds better language in which to 
express the teachings of God’s Holy Word.

                <h2>The Holy Scriptures</h2>
                <p>
The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of 
God, given by divine inspiration. The inspired authors spoke and wrote as 
they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to 
humanity the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the 
supreme, authoritative, and the infallible revelation of His will. They are the 
standard of character, the test of experience, the definitive revealer of 
doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God’s acts in history.

                <h2>The Trinity</h2>
                <p>
There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three coeternal 
Persons. God is immortal, all-powerful, all-knowing, above all, and ever 
present. He is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet known through 
His self-revelation. God, who is love, is forever worthy of worship, adoration, 
and service by the whole creation. (Gen. 1:26; Deut. 6:4; Isa. 6:8; Matt. 
28:19; John 3:16; 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 13:14; Eph. 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2.)

                <h2>The Father</h2>
                <p>
God the eternal Father is the Creator, Source, Sustainer, and Sovereign 
of all creation. He is just and holy, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and 
abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers 
exhibited in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also those of the Father. 
(Gen. 1:1; Deut. 4:35; Ps. 110:1, 4; John 3:16; 14:9; 1 Cor. 15:28; 
1 Tim. 1:17; 1 John 4:8; Rev. 4:11.)

                <h2>The Son</h2>
                <p>God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all 
things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of 
humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He 
became also truly human, Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy 
Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced temptation as a 
human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. 
By His miracles He manifested God’s power and was attested as God’s 
promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins 
and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to heaven to minister 
in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in glory for the 
final deliverance of His people and the restoration of all things. (Isa. 53:4-6; 
Dan. 9:25-27; Luke 1:35; John 1:1-3, 14; 5:22; 10:30; 14:1-3, 9, 13; Rom. 
6:23; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4; 2 Cor. 3:18; 5:17-19; Phil. 2:5-11; Col. 1:15-19; Heb.

                <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
                <p>
God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in Creation, 
incarnation, and redemption. He is as much a person as are the Father and the 
Son. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ’s life with power. 
He draws and convicts human beings; and those who respond He renews and 
transforms into the image of God. Sent by the Father and the Son to be always 
with His children, He extends spiritual gifts to the church, empowers it to 
bear witness to Christ, and in harmony with the Scriptures leads it into all
truth. (Gen. 1:1, 2; 2 Sam. 23:2; Ps. 51:11; Isa. 61:1; Luke 1:35; 4:18; John 
14:16-18, 26; 15:26; 16:7-13; Acts 1:8; 5:3; 10:38; Rom. 5:5; 1 Cor. 12:7-11;

                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>
God has revealed in Scripture the authentic and historical account of His 
creative activity. He created the universe, and in a recent six-day creation the 
Lord made “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” and 
rested on the seventh day. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual 
memorial of the work He performed and completed during six literal days 
that together with the Sabbath constituted the same unit of time that we call 
a week today. The first man and woman were made in the image of God as 
the crowning work of Creation, given dominion over the world, and charged 
with responsibility to care for it. When the world was finished it was “very
good,” declaring the glory of God. (Gen. 1-2; 5; 11; Ex. 20:8-11; Ps. 19:1-6; 
33:6, 9; 104; Isa. 45:12, 18; Acts 17:24; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2; 11:3; Rev. 10:6;

                <h2>The Nature of Humanity</h2>
                <p>
Man and woman were made in the image of God with individuality, the 
power and freedom to think and to do. Though created free beings, each is an 
indivisible unity of body, mind, and spirit, dependent upon God for life and 
breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their 
dependence upon Him and fell from their high position. The image of God in 
them was marred and they became subject to death. Their descendants share
this fallen nature and its consequences. They are born with weaknesses and 
tendencies to evil. But God in Christ reconciled the world to Himself and by 
His Spirit restores in penitent mortals the image of their Maker. Created for 
the glory of God, they are called to love Him and one another, and to care for 
their environment. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:7, 15; 3; Ps. 8:4-8; 51:5, 10; 58:3; Jer. 
17:9; Acts 17:24-28; Rom. 5:12-17; 2 Cor. 5:19, 20; Eph. 2:3; 1 Thess. 5:23; 
1 John 3:4; 4:7, 8, 11, 20.)

                <h2>The Great Controversy</h2>
                <p>
All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and 
Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the 
universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, endowed 
with freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, God’s adversary, 
and led into rebellion a portion of the angels. He introduced the spirit of 
rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. This human sin 
resulted in the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the disordering of 
the created world, and its eventual devastation at the time of the global flood, 
as presented in the historical account of Genesis 1-11. Observed by the whole 
creation, this world became the arena of the universal conflict, out of which 
the God of love will ultimately be vindicated. To assist His people in this 
controversy, Christ sends the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, 
protect, and sustain them in the way of salvation. (Gen. 3; 6-8; Job 1:6-12; 
Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:12-18; Rom. 1:19-32; 3:4; 5:12-21; 8:19-22; 1 Cor. 
4:9; Heb. 1:14; 1 Peter 5:8; 2 Peter 3:6; Rev. 12:4-9.)

                <h2>The Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ</h2>
                <p>
In Christ’s life of perfect obedience to God’s will, His suffering, death, 
and resurrection, God provided the only means of atonement for human sin, 
so that those who by faith accept this atonement may have eternal life, and 
the whole creation may better understand the infinite and holy love of the 
Creator. This perfect atonement vindicates the righteousness of God’s law 
and the graciousness of His character; for it both condemns our sin and 
provides for our forgiveness. The death of Christ is substitutionary and 
expiatory, reconciling and transforming. The bodily resurrection of Christ
proclaims God’s triumph over the forces of evil, and for those who accept the 
atonement assures their final victory over sin and death. It declares the 
Lordship of Jesus Christ, before whom every knee in heaven and on earth 
will bow. (Gen. 3:15; Ps. 22:1; Isa. 53; John 3:16; 14:30; Rom. 1:4; 3:25; 
4:25; 8:3, 4; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4, 20-22; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15, 19-21; Phil. 2:6-11; 
Col. 2:15; 1 Peter 2:21, 22; 1 John 2:2; 4:10.)

                <h2>The Experience of Salvation</h2>
                <p>
In infinite love and mercy God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin 
for us, so that in Him we might be made the righteousness of God. Led by the 
Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of our 
transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Saviour and Lord, Substitute and 
Example. This saving faith comes through the divine power of the Word and 
is the gift of God’s grace. Through Christ we are justified, adopted as God’s 
sons and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin. Through the Spirit 
we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews our minds, writes God’s 
law of love in our hearts, and we are given the power to live a holy life. 
Abiding in Him we become partakers of the divine nature and have the 
assurance of salvation now and in the judgment. (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 45:22; 53; 
Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 33:11; 36:25-27; Hab. 2:4; Mark 9:23, 24; John 3:3-8, 
16; 16:8; Rom. 3:21-26; 5:6-10; 8:1-4, 14-17; 10:17; 12:2; 2 Cor. 5:17-21; 
Gal. 1:4; 3:13, 14, 26; 4:4-7; Eph. 2:4-10; Col. 1:13, 14; Titus 3:3-7; 
Heb. 8:7-12; 1 Peter 1:23; 2:21, 22; 2 Peter 1:3, 4; Rev. 13:8.)

                <h2>Growing in Christ</h2>
                <p>
By His death on the cross Jesus triumphed over the forces of evil. He 
who subjugated the demonic spirits during His earthly ministry has broken 
their power and made certain their ultimate doom. Jesus’ victory gives us 
victory over the evil forces that still seek to control us, as we walk with Him 
in peace, joy, and assurance of His love. Now the Holy Spirit dwells within 
us and empowers us. Continually committed to Jesus as our Saviour and 
Lord, we are set free from the burden of our past deeds. No longer do we live 
in the darkness, fear of evil powers, ignorance, and meaninglessness of our 
former way of life. In this new freedom in Jesus, we are called to grow into 
the likeness of His character, communing with Him daily in prayer, feeding 
on His Word, meditating on it and on His providence, singing His praises, 
gathering together for worship, and participating in the mission of the 
Church. We are also called to follow Christ’s example by compassionately 
ministering to the physical, mental, social, emotional, and spiritual needs of 
humanity. As we give ourselves in loving service to those around us and in 
witnessing to His salvation, His constant presence with us through the Spirit 
transforms every moment and every task into a spiritual experience. (1 Chron. 
29:11; Ps. 1:1, 2; 23:4; 77:11, 12; Matt. 20:25-28; 25:31-46; Luke 10:17-20;

                <h2>The Church</h2>
                <p>
The church is the community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as 
Lord and Saviour. In continuity with the people of God in Old Testament 
times, we are called out from the world; and we join together for worship, for 
fellowship, for instruction in the Word, for the celebration of the Lord’s 
Supper, for service to humanity, and for the worldwide proclamation of the 
gospel. The church derives its authority from Christ, who is the incarnate 
Word revealed in the Scriptures. The church is God’s family; adopted by Him 
as children, its members live on the basis of the new covenant. The church is 
the body of Christ, a community of faith of which Christ Himself is the Head. 
The church is the bride for whom Christ died that He might sanctify and 
cleanse her. At His return in triumph, He will present her to Himself a 
glorious church, the faithful of all the ages, the purchase of His blood, not 
having spot or wrinkle, but holy and without blemish. (Gen. 12:1-3; Exod. 
19:3-7; Matt. 16:13-20; 18:18; 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38-42; 7:38; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 
1:22, 23; 2:19-22; 3:8-11; 5:23-27; Col. 1:17, 18; 1 Peter 2:9.)

                <h2>The Remnant and Its Mission</h2>
                <p>
The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but 
in the last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called out 
to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This remnant 
announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through 
Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent. This proclamation is 
symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14; it coincides with the work 
of judgment in heaven and results in a work of repentance and reform on 
earth. Every believer is called to have a personal part in this worldwide 
witness. (Dan. 7:9-14; Isa. 1:9; 11:11; Jer. 23:3; Mic. 2:12; 2 Cor. 5:10; 
1 Peter 1:16-19; 4:17; 2 Peter 3:10-14; Jude 3, 14; Rev. 12:17; 14:6-12; 18:1-

                <h2>Unity in the Body of Christ</h2>
                <p>
The church is one body with many members, called from every nation, 
kindred, tongue, and people. In Christ we are a new creation; distinctions of 
race, culture, learning, and nationality, and differences between high and low, 
rich and poor, male and female, must not be divisive among us. We are all 
equal in Christ, who by one Spirit has bonded us into one fellowship with 
Him and with one another; we are to serve and be served without partiality 
or reservation. Through the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Scriptures we 
share the same faith and hope, and reach out in one witness to all. This unity 
has its source in the oneness of the triune God, who has adopted us as His 
children. (Ps. 133:1; Matt. 28:19, 20; John 17:20-23; Acts 17:26, 27; Rom. 
12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-14; 2 Cor. 5:16, 17; Gal. 3:27-29; Eph. 2:13-16; 4:3-6,

By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus

of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, 
and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union 
with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. 
It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in 
Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy 
Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38; 
16:30-33; 22:16; Rom. 6:1-6; Gal. 3:27; Col. 2:12, 13.)

The Lord’s Supper is a participation in the emblems of the body and 
blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour. In this 
experience of communion Christ is present to meet and strengthen His 
people. As we partake, we joyfully proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes 
again. Preparation for the Supper includes self-examination, repentance, and 
confession. The Master ordained the service of foot-washing to signify 
renewed cleansing, to express a willingness to serve one another in Christlike 
humility, and to unite our hearts in love. The communion service is open to 
all believing Christians. (Matt. 26:17-30; John 6:48-63; 13:1-17; 1 Cor.

                <h2>Spiritual Gifts and Ministries</h2>
                <p>
God bestows upon all members of His church in every age spiritual gifts 
that each member is to employ in loving ministry for the common good of 
the church and of humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who 
apportions to each member as He wills, the gifts provide all abilities and 
ministries needed by the church to fulfill its divinely ordained functions. 
According to the Scriptures, these gifts include such ministries as faith, 
healing, prophecy, proclamation, teaching, administration, reconciliation, 
compassion, and self-sacrificing service and charity for the help and 
encouragement of people. Some members are called of God and endowed by 
the Spirit for functions recognized by the church in pastoral, evangelistic, and 
teaching ministries particularly needed to equip the members for service, to 
build up the church to spiritual maturity, and to foster unity of the faith and 
knowledge of God. When members employ these spiritual gifts as faithful 
stewards of God’s varied grace, the church is protected from the destructive 
influence of false doctrine, grows with a growth that is from God, and is built 
up in faith and love. (Acts 6:1-7; Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:7-11, 27, 28; Eph. 
4:8, 11-16; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; 1 Peter 4:10, 11.)

The Scriptures testify that one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. 
This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and we believe it was 
manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Her writings speak with 
prophetic authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction, and 
correction to the church. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard 
by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Num. 12:6; 2 Chron.

                <h2>The Law of God</h2>
                <p>
The great principles of God’s law are embodied in the Ten 
Commandments and exemplified in the life of Christ. They express God’s 
love, will, and purposes concerning human conduct and relationships and are 
binding upon all people in every age. These precepts are the basis of God’s 
covenant with His people and the standard in God’s judgment. Through the 
agency of the Holy Spirit they point out sin and awaken a sense of need for a 
Saviour. Salvation is all of grace and not of works, and its fruit is obedience 
to the Commandments. This obedience develops Christian character and 
results in a sense of well-being. It is an evidence of our love for the Lord and 
our concern for our fellow human beings. The obedience of faith 
demonstrates the power of Christ to transform lives, and therefore strengthens 
Christian witness. (Exod. 20:1-17; Deut. 28:1-14; Ps. 19:7-14; 40:7, 8; Matt.

                <h2>The Sabbath</h2>
                <p>
The gracious Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh 
day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of Creation. The 
fourth commandment of God’s unchangeable law requires the observance of 
this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony 
with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath 
is a day of delightful communion with God and one another. It is a symbol of 
our redemption in Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our 
allegiance, and a foretaste of our eternal future in God’s kingdom. The 
Sabbath is God’s perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and 
His people. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, 
sunset to sunset, is a celebration of God’s creative and redemptive acts.

                <h2>Stewardship</h2>
                <p>
We are God’s stewards, entrusted by Him with time and opportunities, 
abilities and possessions, and the blessings of the earth and its resources. We 
are responsible to Him for their proper use. We acknowledge God’s 
ownership by faithful service to Him and our fellow human beings, and by 
returning tithe and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and 
the support and growth of His church. Stewardship is a privilege given to us 
by God for nurture in love and the victory over selfishness and covetousness. 
Stewards rejoice in the blessings that come to others as a result of their
faithfulness. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:15; 1 Chron. 29:14; Haggai 1:3-11; Mal. 3:8-
12; Matt. 23:23; Rom. 15:26, 27; 1 Cor. 9:9-14; 2 Cor. 8:1-15; 9:7.)

                <h2>Christian Behavior</h2>
                <p>
We are called to be a godly people who think, feel, and act in harmony 
with biblical principles in all aspects of personal and social life. For the Spirit 
to recreate in us the character of our Lord we involve ourselves only in those 
things that will produce Christlike purity, health, and joy in our lives. This 
means that our amusement and entertainment should meet the highest 
standards of Christian taste and beauty. While recognizing cultural 
differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat, befitting those whose 
true beauty does not consist of outward adornment but in the imperishable
ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit. It also means that because our bodies
are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we are to care for them intelligently. Along 
with adequate exercise and rest, we are to adopt the most healthful diet 
possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures. Since 
alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and the irresponsible use of drugs and narcotics
are harmful to our bodies, we are to abstain from them as well. Instead, we 
are to engage in whatever brings our thoughts and bodies into the discipline 
of Christ, who desires our wholesomeness, joy, and goodness. (Gen. 7:2; 
Exod. 20:15; Lev. 11:1-47; Ps. 106:3; Rom. 12:1, 2; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 10:31;

                <h2>Marriage and the Family</h2>
                <p>
Marriage was divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be a 
lifelong union between a man and a woman in loving companionship. For the 
Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, and 
should be entered into only between a man and a woman who share a 
common faith. Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility are the fabric 
of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, closeness, and 
permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church. Regarding 
divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse, except for 
fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Although some family 
relationships may fall short of the ideal, a man and a woman who fully 
commit themselves to each other in Christ through marriage may achieve 
loving unity through the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the church. 
God blesses the family and intends that its members shall assist each other 
toward complete maturity. Increasing family closeness is one of the earmarks 
of the final gospel message. Parents are to bring up their children to love and 
obey the Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them that 
Christ is a loving, tender, and caring guide who wants them to become 
members of His body, the family of God which embraces both single and 
married persons. (Gen. 2:18-25; Exod. 20:12; Deut. 6:5-9; Prov. 22:6; Mal. 
4:5, 6; Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:3-9, 12; Mark 10:11, 12; John 2:1-11; 1 Cor. 7:7, 
10, 11; 2 Cor. 6:14; Eph. 5:21-33; 6:1-4.)

                <h2>Christ’s Ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary</h2>
                <p>
There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle that the Lord set up 
and not humans. In it Christ ministers on our behalf, making available to 
believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice offered once for all on the cross. 
At His ascension, He was inaugurated as our great High Priest and, began His 
intercessory ministry, which was typified by the work of the high priest in the 
holy place of the earthly sanctuary. In 1844, at the end of the prophetic period 
of 2300 days, He entered the second and last phase of His atoning ministry, 
which was typified by the work of the high priest in the most holy place of 
the earthly sanctuary. It is a work of investigative judgment which is part of 
the ultimate disposition of all sin, typified by the cleansing of the ancient 
Hebrew sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. In that typical service the 
sanctuary was cleansed with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the heavenly 
things are purified with the perfect sacrifice of the blood of Jesus. The 
investigative judgment reveals to heavenly intelligences who among the dead 
are asleep in Christ and therefore, in Him, are deemed worthy to have part in 
the first resurrection. It also makes manifest who among the living are abiding 
in Christ, keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and in 
Him, therefore, are ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. This 
judgment vindicates the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus. 
It declares that those who have remained loyal to God shall receive the 
kingdom. The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of 
human probation before the Second Advent. (Lev. 16; Num. 14:34; 
Ezek. 4:6; Dan. 7:9-27; 8:13, 14; 9:24-27; Heb. 1:3; 2:16, 17; 4:14-16; 8:1-5; 
9:11-28; 10:19-22; Rev. 8:3-5; 11:19; 14:6, 7, 12; 20:12; 22:11, 12.)

                <h2>The Second Coming of Christ</h2>
                <p>
The second coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the 
grand climax of the gospel. The Saviour’s coming will be literal, personal, 
visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be 
resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be glorified and taken 
to heaven, but the unrighteous will die. The almost complete fulfillment of 
most lines of prophecy, together with the present condition of the world, 
indicates that Christ’s coming is near. The time of that event has not been 
revealed, and we are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times. (Matt. 24;

                <h2>Death and Resurrection</h2>
                <p>
The wages of sin is death. But God, who alone is immortal, will grant 
eternal life to His redeemed. Until that day death is an unconscious state for 
all people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected righteous 
and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up to meet their Lord. 
The second resurrection, the resurrection of the unrighteous, will take place 
a thousand years later. (Job 19:25-27; Ps. 146:3, 4; Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10; Dan. 12:2,

                <h2>The Millennium and the End of Sin</h2>
                <p>
The millennium is the thousand-year reign of Christ with His saints in 
heaven between the first and second resurrections. During this time the 
wicked dead will be judged; the earth will be utterly desolate, without living 
human inhabitants, but occupied by Satan and his angels. At its close Christ 
with His saints and the Holy City will descend from heaven to earth. The
unrighteous dead will then be resurrected, and with Satan and his angels will 
surround the city; but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the earth. 
The universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever. (Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 
28:18, 19; Mal. 4:1; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Rev. 20; 21:1-5.)

                <p>
On the new earth, in which righteousness dwells, God will provide 
an eternal home for the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting 
life, love, joy, and learning in His presence. For here God Himself will dwell 
with His people, and suffering and death will have passed away. The great 
controversy will be ended, and sin will be no more. All things, animate and 
inanimate, will declare that God is love; and He shall reign forever. Amen.
