                <h2>A Divinely Appointed Ministry</h2>
                <p>“God has a church, and she has a divinely appointed ministry. ‘And He 
gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, 
pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the 
ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity 
of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto 
the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. . . . ’
“Men appointed of God have been chosen to watch with jealous care, 
with vigilant perseverance, that the church may not be overthrown by the evil 
devices of Satan, but that she shall stand in the world to promote the glory of 
God among men.”—TM 52, 53.
Conference President—The conference president should be an 
ordained pastor of experience and good report. He stands at the head of the 
gospel ministry in the conference and is the chief elder, or overseer, of all the 
churches. He works for their spiritual welfare and counsels them regarding 
their activities and plans. He has access to all the churches and their services, 
business meetings, and boards, without vote unless granted by the church, or 
unless he is a member of that congregation. He may, by virtue of his office, 
preside over any meeting of any church when necessary. He has access to all 
church records.
The conference president does not have authority to set aside the duly 
elected officers of the church, but will work in cooperation with them. They 
in turn are bound, in recognition of the ties of conference fellowship, to 
counsel with him over all that pertains to the welfare of the church. They 
should not attempt to exclude him from a proper discharge of his duties.
Conference Departmental Directors—Conference departmental 
directors foster important lines of denominational work under the general 
direction of the conference executive committee in consultation with the 
conference president. In order to successfully carry on the work assigned to 
them, these employees must have access to the churches so they can present 
and develop their plans. These employees will have sympathetic 
consideration for all church plans, even outside their respective departments.
Departmental directors are not vested with administrative or executive 
authority, so their relation to local churches is advisory. Their work does not 
bear the same relationship to the churches as that of the conference executive 
committee or president. In the promotion of their specific kinds of work, they 
labor throughout the entire conference. However, they are not expected to 
counsel churches regarding elections and other administrative duties or any 
other line of service, unless especially requested to do so by the conference 
president.
Ordained Pastors—Ordained pastors appointed by the conference 
executive committee to act as pastors or district leaders do not take the place 
of the president in their respective fields. They are not charged with 
administrative powers as is the president, but they cooperate with him in 
carrying out the plans and policies of the conference.
On assignment to a local church, the ordained pastor is assisted by the 
local elders. By virtue of ordination, the pastor is qualified to function in all 
rites and ceremonies. The pastor should be the congregation’s spiritual leader 
and adviser. Pastors should instruct the officers in their duties and plan with 
them for all lines of church work and activity.
The pastor is a member of the church board and serves as its chairperson. 
If the pastor desires to be relieved of the responsibility of acting as 
chairperson of the board, an elder serves as chairperson in cooperation with 
the pastor. (See p. 79.) The pastor, with the assistance of the elders, is 
expected to plan for and lead out in all spiritual services, such as Sabbath 
morning worship and prayer meeting, and should officiate at the communion 
service and baptism. Pastors should not surround themselves with any special 
body of counselors of their own choosing, but always cooperate with the 
elected officers.
When an evangelist is asked to conduct an evangelistic effort where there 
is a church, the conference should invite the pastor to assist the evangelist, 
thus giving the pastor an opportunity to become acquainted with prospective 
members.
Pastors or assistant pastors are not nominated or elected to such positions 
by the church. Their connection with the church is by appointment of the 
conference executive committee, and such appointments may be changed at 
any time. (See p. 79.)
A pastor may be removed from office by conference executive 
committee action without the individual’s church membership being affected. 
But when a pastor is removed from church membership and subsequently 
restored to membership as a layperson, the pastor’s membership restoration 
does not mean restoration to the ministry.
Licensed Pastors—To give individuals an opportunity to demonstrate 
their call to the ministry, especially in the area of soul winning, prospective 
candidates are granted pastoral licenses by the conference. The granting of 
such licenses confers the opportunity to develop the ministerial gift.
Licensed pastors are authorized to preach, to engage in evangelism, to 
lead out in outreach (missionary) work, and to assist in all church activities.
There are circumstances, however, where it is necessary for the 
conference to appoint a licensed pastor to carry responsibility as a pastor or 
assistant pastor of a church or group of churches. In order to open the way 
for a licensed pastor to perform certain pastoral functions, the church or group 
of churches being served must elect the pastor as a local elder. Then, since 
the right to permit the extension of a licensed pastor’s authority rests first 
with the division executive committee, it must approve the extension by 
specifically and clearly defining the additional functions that that licensed 
pastor may perform. The extended functions are limited only to the church or 
group of churches where the pastor is assigned and is an elder. After the 
division executive committee acts, the conference executive committee may 
act. (See p. 79.)
The conference executive committee shall not extend the functions of a 
licensed pastor beyond what has been authorized by the division executive 
committee. It also shall not authorize a licensed pastor to perform the 
extended functions in any church beyond where the licensed pastor is 
assigned and is an elder. A conference executive committee action cannot be 
substituted for church election or ordination to gospel ministry.
Bible Instructors—The conference may employ Bible instructors and 
assign them to work with evangelistic efforts or with local congregations. 
Though the instructors work under the general direction of the conference, an 
instructor assigned to an evangelistic effort works under the direction of the 
evangelist conducting the campaign, and an instructor assigned to a church 
works under the direction of the pastor. An instructor should not, except by 
special arrangement with the conference, be asked to carry a church office, 
but should be left free to carry on soul-winning work.
Conference Directs Church Employees—The conference president in 
counsel with the conference executive committee directs all conference 
employees, such as pastors, Bible instructors, and departmental directors, 
who receive their credentials from and are responsible to the conference, not 
the local church. A church may ask the conference president for the services 
or help of conference employees, but appointments in all cases rest with the 
conference executive committee. The conference executive committee may 
change employee assignments whenever it believes they are needed. The 
employee or the church may appeal to the conference executive committee 
for a hearing on the decision to remove the employee, and the committee will 
carefully consider the appeal in light of the needs of the entire conference. If 
the employee refuses to cooperate with the committee and declines to work 
in harmony with its decisions, the committee may regard the employee’s 
conduct as insubordination and may deal with it accordingly. In no case 
should the employee appeal to the church regarding such decisions. If a local 
church supports an employee’s refusal to cooperate, it also becomes subject 
to conference discipline.

                <h2>Credentials and Licenses</h2>
<p>
God’s work is to be jealously safeguarded by responsible leaders from 
the local church to the General Conference. Official credentials and licenses 
are issued to all authorized full-time Church employees and are granted by 
controlling committees for limited periods.
            
In a local conference, the committee confers authority upon individuals 
to represent the Church as pastors and gospel workers. This authority is 
represented by the granting of credentials and licenses, which are written 
commissions, properly dated and signed by the officers of the conference. 
The authority thus conveyed is not personal or inherent in the individual but 
is inherent in the granting body, which may recall the credentials for cause at 
any time. Credentials and licenses granted employees are not their personal 
property and must be returned when employment is terminated or at the 
request of the organization that issued them.
            
No one should be allowed to speak to any congregation unless he/she has 
been invited by the church in harmony with guidelines given by the 
conference. It is recognized, however, that there are times when 
congregations may be addressed by government officials or civic leaders; but 
all unauthorized persons shall not be given access to the pulpit. (See pp. 126-
127.)
            
Expired Credentials and Licenses—Credentials and licenses are 
granted for the duration of the term as provided for by the conference 
constitution and bylaws or operating policy and are renewed by a vote of the 
conference in session or by the executive committee. Possession of an expired 
credential or license gives the person no authority whatsoever.
Retired Employees—Retired employees deserve honor and 
consideration for helping build up God’s church. They may continue to bless 
and help the congregations where they hold membership through election to 
any office. They also may exercise pastoral functions under the direction of 
the conference executive committee.
            
Former Pastors Without Credentials—Individuals previously 
ordained as pastors but who no longer have valid credentials may be elected 
as elders and, if their ordinations have not been invalidated, need not be 
ordained as elders. Their services are limited to the functions of a local elder.
