            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Why does the Seventh-day Adventist Church have a Church Manual? 
God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. 
Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved 
through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal 
operations and in the fulfillment of its mission to the world. In order for it to 
be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and 
humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline.
</p>
<p>Scripture affirms that;
<blockquote>
“all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40).
</blockquote>

<p>
Ellen G. White pointed out such needs in 1875: 
<blockquote>
“The church of Christ is 
in constant peril. Satan is seeking to destroy the people of God, and one man’s 
mind, one man’s judgment, is not sufficient to be trusted. Christ would have 
His followers brought together in church capacity, observing order, having 
rules and discipline, and all subject one to another, esteeming others better 
than themselves.”—3T 445.
</blockquote>
            
<p>
But Church leaders did not quickly produce a book of rules for Church 
governance, even though the General Conference Session met annually 
during the Church’s early years and delegates voted on matters of church 
order and life. Finally, in 1882, the General Conference Session voted to have 
prepared 
<blockquote>
            “instructions to church officers, to be printed in the Review and 
Herald or in tract form.”—RH, Dec. 26, 1882.
</blockquote>
            
<p>
This revealed the growing 
realization that order was imperative if organization was to function 
effectively and that uniformity in order required its guiding principles to be 
put into printed form.
</p>
            
<p>
However, when the proposal to place the articles in permanent form as a 
church manual came before the 1883 General Conference Session, delegates 
rejected the idea. They feared a manual might formalize the Church and take 
from its pastors their individual freedom to deal with matters of order as they 
desired.
</p>
            
<p>
But this fear—doubtless reflecting the opposition that had existed 20 
years before to any kind of organization—evidently soon lessened. The 
annual General Conference Sessions continued to take actions on matters of 
order.
</p>
            
<p>
Though the Church officially declined to adopt a manual, leaders from 
time to time gathered together in book or booklet-form the generally accepted 
rules of church life. Perhaps the most impressive was a 184-page book
published in 1907 by pioneer J. N. Loughborough entitled The Church, Its
Organization, Order and Discipline, which dealt with many of the topics now 
covered by this Church Manual.
</p>
            
<p>
As the Church worldwide grew rapidly in the early twentieth century, it 
increasingly recognized the need for a manual for worldwide use by its 
pastors and lay members. In 1931 the General Conference Committee voted 
to publish a church manual. J. L. McElhany, later president of the General 
Conference, prepared the manuscript, which was published in 1932.
</p>
            
<p>
The opening sentence of the preface of that first edition observed that 
<blockquote>
            “it 
has become increasingly evident that a manual on church government is 
needed to set forth and preserve our denominational practices and polity.”
</blockquote>
            
<p>
Note the word preserve. This was no attempt to suddenly create and 
impose upon the Church a whole pattern of church governance. Rather it was 
an endeavor first to preserve all the good actions taken through the years and 
then to add rules required by the Church’s increasing growth and complexity.

                <h2>Authority and Function of the Church Manual</h2>
<p>
The Church Manual has existed in its current format since 1932. It 
describes the operation and functions of local churches and their relationship 
to denominational structures in which they hold membership. The Church 
Manual also expresses the Church’s understanding of Christian life and 
church governance and discipline based on biblical principles and the 
authority of duly assembled General Conference Sessions. 
            
<blockquote>
            “God has ordained 
that the representatives of His church from all parts of the earth, when 
assembled in a General Conference, shall have authority.”—9T 261.
</blockquote>
            
<p>
The Church Manual is divided into two types of material. The content 
of each chapter is of worldwide value and is applicable to every church 
organization, congregation, and member. Recognizing the need for variations 
in some sections, additional explanatory material, presented as guidance and 
examples, appears as notes at the end of the Church Manual. The notes have 
subheadings corresponding to chapter subheadings and page numbers of the 
main text.
</p>
            
<p>
The standards and practices of the Church are based upon the principles 
of the Holy Scriptures. These principles, underscored by the Spirit of 
Prophecy, are set forth in this Church Manual. They are to be followed in all 
matters pertaining to the administration and operation of local churches. The 
Church Manual also defines the relationship that exists between the local 
congregation and the conference or other entities of Seventh-day Adventist 
denominational organization. No attempt should be made to set up standards 
of membership or to make, or attempt to enforce, rules or regulations for local 
church operations that are contrary to these decisions adopted by the General 
Conference in Session and that are set forth in this Church Manual.

                <h2>Making Changes</h2>
<p>
The General Conference through the years voted important changes 
concerning the Church Manual. Realizing the importance of conducting the 
worldwide work of the Church “decently and in order,” the 1946 General 
Conference Session voted that;
            
<blockquote>
“all changes or revisions of policy that are to 
be made in the Manual shall be authorized by the General Conference 
Session.”—General Conference Report, No. 8, p. 197 (June 14, 1946).
</blockquote>
            
<p>
In 1948, recognizing that local conditions sometimes call for special 
actions, the General Conference Committee voted that;
            
<blockquote>
            “each division, 
including the North American Division of the world field, prepare a 
‘Supplement’ to the new Church Manual not in any way modifying it but 
containing such additional matter as is applicable to the conditions and 
circumstances prevailing in the division; the manuscripts for these 
Supplements to be submitted to the General Conference Committee for 
endorsement before being printed.”—Autumn Council Actions, 1948, p. 19.
</blockquote>
            
<p>
The 2000 General Conference Session authorized the reclassification of 
some existing Church Manual material into the Notes section as guidance 
and examples rather than mandatory material, and approved the process for 
making changes. Changes in the Church Manual, except for the notes and 
editorial changes, can be made only by action of a General Conference 
Session, where delegates of the world church have voice and vote. If a local 
church, conference, or union conference/mission wishes to propose a Church 
Manual revision, it should submit its proposal to the next constituent level 
for counsel and study. If that level approves the proposal, it submits the 
suggested revision to the next level for additional evaluation. If the various 
levels approve the proposal, it eventually comes before the General 
Conference Church Manual Committee, which considers all recommendations. If the Church Manual Committee approves a revision, it 
prepares it for presentation at an Annual Council and/or General Conference 
Session.
</p>
            
<p>
Revision of a note follows the same procedure. The General Conference 
Executive Committee may approve changes to the notes at any Annual 
Council.
</p>
            
<p>
The Church Manual Committee reports proposed nonsubstantive 
editorial changes to the main content of the Church Manual to an Annual 
Council of the General Conference Executive Committee, which may give 
final approval. However, in the event the Annual Council determines by one-
third vote that an editorial change substantively alters the meaning of a 
passage, the proposed change must go to the General Conference Session.
At the final Annual Council of a quinquennium, the General Conference 
Executive Committee reviews all changes to the notes and coordinates the 
changes with any proposed amendments to the main content of the Church 
Manual.
</p>
            
<p>
A new edition of the Church Manual is published after every General 
Conference Session. The most recent edition should always be used. This 
edition incorporates amendments made at the postponed 2020 General
Conference Session, which took place in 2022.

                <h2>Where to Get Advice</h2>
<p>
Church officers and leaders, pastors, and members should consult with 
their conference for advice pertaining to the operating of their congregation 
or on questions arising from the Church Manual. If they do not reach mutual 
understanding, they should consult with their union conference/mission for 
clarification.

                <h2>Terms Used in the Church Manual</h2>
<p>
Church—For editorial and printing economy, “Church,” with a capital 
C, in these pages is used in place of the full term “Seventh-day Adventist 
Church” and refers to the overall Church organization rather than to a local 
church or congregation, with the exception of when it is referred to within a 
quotation. References to a local church will also generally apply to a 
company.
</p>
            
<p>
Conference, mission, section, delegation, field, union of churches—For 
purposes of editorial and printing economy, “conference” in these pages 
means “conference, mission, field, section, delegation, or union of churches,” 
as the administrative context indicates. Generally, each congregation is a 
member of the sisterhood of churches known as a conference, but until the 
local organization achieves conference status, under General Conference 
Working Policy it may be identified as a mission, section, delegation, or field. 
</p>
            
<p>
In some world divisions, unions of churches in a particular country function 
as a conference for local-church purposes and as a union for other Church 
organizational purposes. (See Chapter 3, “Organization and Authority.”)
Pastor and minister—Most areas of the world Church use “pastor” to 
identify a member of the clergy, so that term is used in these pages rather than 
“minister,” regardless of the responsibilities assigned by the local conference. 
Use of the term here is not intended to mandate that usage where the custom 
is to use “minister.” Pastors referred to in this manual are those who have 
been appointed by the conference to oversee the affairs of the local church or 
district.
</p>
            
<p>
Abbreviations of Ellen G. White’s books are identified on p. 192.
Scripture quotations are taken from the New King James Version unless 
otherwise indicated, with the exception of when referred to within a Spirit of 
Prophecy quotation.
