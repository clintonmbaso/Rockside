                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The biblical plan for the support of the work of God is by the tithes and 
offerings of His people. The Lord says, “Bring all the tithes into the 
storehouse, that there may be food in My house” (Mal. 3:10). The Church has 
followed this plan from its earliest days.
“The system of tithes and offerings was intended to impress the minds 
of men with a great truth—that God is the source of every blessing to His 
creatures, and that to Him man’s gratitude is due for the good gifts of His 
providence.”—PP 525.
“Tithes and offerings for God are an acknowledgment of His claim on 
us by creation, and they are also an acknowledgment of His claim by 
redemption. Because all our power is derived from Christ, these offerings are 
to flow from us to God. They are to keep ever before us the claim of 
redemption, the greatest of all claims, and the one that involves every 
other.”—6T 479.
“The tithe is sacred, reserved by God for Himself. It is to be brought into 
His treasury to be used to sustain the gospel laborers in their work.”—
9T 249.
“He has given His people a plan for raising sums sufficient to make the 
enterprise self-sustaining. God’s plan in the tithing system is beautiful in its 
simplicity and equality. All may take hold of it in faith and courage, for it is 
divine in its origin. In it are combined simplicity and utility. . . . Every man, 
woman, and youth may become a treasurer for the Lord and may be an agent 
to meet the demands upon the treasury. Says the apostle: ‘Let every one of 
you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.’ ”—3T 388, 389.
“God has made the proclamation of the gospel dependent upon the labors 
and the gifts of His people. Voluntary offerings and the tithe constitute the 
revenue of the Lord’s work. Of the means entrusted to man, God claims a 
certain portion—the tenth. He leaves all free to say whether or not they will 
give more than this.”—AA 74.
“God has given special direction as to the use of the tithe. He does not 
design that His work shall be crippled for want of means. . . . The portion that 
God has reserved for Himself is not to be diverted to any other purpose than 
that which He has specified. Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe, to 
use according to their own judgment. They are not to use it for themselves in 
an emergency, nor to apply it as they see fit, even in what they may regard as 
the Lord’s work.”—9T 247.

                <h2>Stewardship</h2>
                <p>Christians are God’s stewards, entrusted with His goods and, as His 
partners, responsible to manage them in harmony with His guidelines and 
principles. The divine counsel is that as His stewards, we are to “be found 
faithful” (1 Cor. 4:2). Though the question of stewardship covers many 
aspects of Christian life and experience, without doubt the stewardship of our 
means is vitally important. It concerns the entire Church family and involves 
our recognition of the sovereignty of God, His ownership of all things, and 
the bestowal of His grace upon our hearts.
While this aspect of Christian stewardship concerns our material 
possessions, it nevertheless reacts upon our Christian experience. The Lord 
requires certain things of us, in order that He may do certain things for us. 
Our yielding obedience to what our heavenly Father requires places this 
phase of stewardship upon a high spiritual plane. He does not arbitrarily 
demand either that we serve Him or that we recognize Him with our gifts. 
But He has so arranged that when we work in harmony with Him in these 
things there will flow to our own hearts great spiritual blessings.
“God desires all His stewards to be exact in following divine 
arrangements. They are not to offset the Lord’s plans by performing some 
deed of charity or giving some gift or some offering when or how they, the 
human agents, shall see fit. It is a very poor policy for men to seek to improve 
on God’s plan, and invent a makeshift, averaging up their good impulses on 
this and that occasion, and offsetting them against God’s requirements. God 
calls upon all to give their influence to His own arrangement.”—9T 248.

                <h2>Tithe</h2>
                <p>In recognition of the biblical plan and the solemn privilege and 
responsibility that rest upon members as children of God and members of His 
body, the Church, all are encouraged to faithfully return a tithe, one tenth of 
their increase or personal income, into the denomination’s treasury.
Tithe shall not be used in any way by the local church, but held in trust 
and remitted to the conference treasurer. Thus tithe from all the churches 
flows into the conference treasury, and percentages are forwarded to the nexthigher level in accordance with General Conference and division working 
policies to meet the expenses of conducting the work of God in their 
respective spheres of responsibility and activity.
These policies have been developed for the gathering and disbursing of 
funds in all the world and for the conducting of the business affairs of the 
cause. The financial and business aspects of the work are of great importance. 
They cannot be separated from the proclamation of the message of salvation. 
They are indeed an integral part of it.
Systematic Benevolence and Unity—The financial plan of the Church 
serves a larger purpose than appears in its financial and statistical reports. 
The system of sharing the funds with the world fields, as outlined by General 
Conference Working Policy, serves a wonderful purpose of unifying the 
Church’s spiritual work throughout the world.
How Tithe Is to Be Used—Tithe is held sacred for the work of the 
ministry, for Bible teaching, and for the support of conference administration 
in the care of the churches and of field outreach (missionary) endeavors. Tithe 
shall not be spent on other work, on paying church or institutional debts, or 
on building programs, except as approved under General Conference 
Working Policy. For more information on the use of tithe, see Notes, #1, p. 
190-191.
“A very plain, definite message has been given to me for our people. I 
am bidden to tell them that they are making a mistake in applying the tithe to 
various objects which, though good in themselves, are not the object to which 
the Lord has said that the tithe should be applied. Those who make this use 
of the tithe are departing from the Lord’s arrangement. God will judge for 
these things.”—9T 248.
How Tithe Is Handled—Tithe is the Lord’s and is to be brought as an 
act of worship to the conference treasury through the church in which the 
person’s membership is held. Where unusual circumstances exist, members 
should consult with conference officers.
Church and Conference Officers to Set Example—Elders and other 
officers, as well as the pastor and conference and institutional employees, are 
expected to set good leadership examples by returning tithe. No one shall be 
continued as either a church officer or conference employee who does not 
conform to this standard of leadership.

                <h2>Offerings</h2>
                <p>In addition to the tithe, Scripture emphasizes our obligation to bring 
offerings to the Lord. The withholding of offerings is classed with 
withholding tithe and is called robbery (Mal. 3:8). Since the Church’s earliest 
days, members have given liberal offerings that have blessed and prospered 
God’s work.
In addition to the traditional calendar of offerings program, where each 
offering taken is for a specific purpose, the General Conference has approved 
the combined offering system and the personal giving plan. The division 
executive committee is authorized to determine which plan(s) will be used in 
its territory.
Sabbath School Offerings—The Church’s most widely used and 
successful method of regular systematic giving is through Sabbath School
offerings, which are devoted to world mission work.
Other Offerings—Other offerings are taken from time to time for world 
mission work and for general and local projects. When any offering is taken, 
all money collected, unless otherwise indicated by the donor, shall be counted 
as part of that particular offering.
Special Gifts to Fields—The financial support of the worldwide work 
of the Church is based on the budget system. Appropriations are made to the 
various fields on the basis of budgeted needs. This is a fair and equitable 
method of distributing the funds.
Where special gifts outside the regular budget plan are made to a 
particular field, a disparity is created to the disadvantage of other fields. If 
such gifts are given for the purpose of starting new work, the work thus 
started may languish when the special gift is used up, or it may have to be 
included in the budget for its future support. Thus other fields, with perhaps 
greater needs but without the opportunity of making them known, would be 
deprived of their equitable part of general funds that would be diverted to the 
work started by special gifts.
History has proved the wisdom of having members generously and 
loyally give their offerings and gifts through the accepted channels and 
knowing that every field shares in the benefits of their giving.
Assisting the Poor and Needy—Offerings for the poor and needy are 
taken to assist the members who require help. A reserve fund should be kept 
for such emergency cases. In addition, the church should take a benevolent 
attitude toward all in need, and the board may make appropriations from this 
fund to assist the church’s health and welfare work for families in the 
community
Church Budget for Local Expenses—The most satisfactory method of 
providing for church expenses is the budget plan. Before the beginning of the 
new budget year, the board should prepare a budget of expenses for church 
activities during the next year. The budget should include all income and 
expenses, including those related to all departments. It should provide for 
such projected costs as utilities, insurance, maintenance, janitor service, 
funds for the poor and needy, and church school expense. (See Notes, #2, 
p. 191, for sample budget.)
The budget should be presented to the church for its study and adoption, 
and for plans to assure that funds shall be provided to balance the budget 
during the coming year. Funds to meet the church expense budget may be 
raised by offerings or subscriptions. Members should be urged to support 
their local church in proportion to their financial circumstances.

                <h2>General Financial Counsel</h2>
                <p>Regulation of Soliciting Funds—The following are regulations for 
soliciting funds:
1. No conference, church, or institution, without special counsel and 
arrangement, shall plan work requiring solicitation of funds from outside its 
territory. Any solicitation within its territory shall be in harmony with local, 
union, division, and General Conference policies. No authority is granted to 
denominational employees representing special interests in one part of the 
field to solicit help in any other part of the field or in any other conference 
without arrangement with and written authorization from conference officers 
where the fund-raising would take place.
2. The following principles protect churches from unauthorized, 
fraudulent, and undenominational solicitation:
a. Pastors and officers shall not grant the privilege of the pulpit to 
persons for fund-raising who have not been recognized or recommended by 
the conference. (See pp. 126-127.) No permission shall be granted to solicit 
funds either publicly or privately without such recognition.
b. All funds contributed for any cause in response to appeals shall 
be passed through regular church channels.
c. Conference and church officers shall take such steps as may be 
necessary to prevent unauthorized or illegal public solicitation.
3. No campaign other than the Annual Appeal (Ingathering or 
equivalent appeal), which involves using Appeal literature and containers 
with authorized Appeal labels, shall be conducted for the solicitation of 
money for either home or overseas mission work. Unions and conferences 
should prevent violations of this regulation.
4. Interdivision employees visiting their home churches or otherwise 
communicating with their home bases are asked to solicit funds only for 
enterprises included in the budget of appropriations, working in cooperation 
with churches and conferences to raise the funds required to meet the 
appropriations on which our world mission work depends. All such funds 
shall be passed through regular channels.
Questionable Methods for Raising Funds—The local church should 
take a strong stand against questionable methods for raising money.
“When money is raised for religious purposes, to what means do many 
churches resort? To bazaars, suppers, fancy fairs, even to lotteries and like 
devices. Often the place set apart for God’s worship is desecrated by feasting 
and drinking, buying, selling, and merrymaking. Respect for the house of 
God and reverence for His worship are lessened in the minds of the youth. 
The barriers of self-restraint are weakened. Selfishness, appetite, the love of 
display, are appealed to, and they strengthen as they are indulged.”—9T 91. 
“As God’s work extends, calls for help will come more and more 
frequently. . . . If professing Christians would faithfully bring to God their 
tithes and offerings, His treasury would be full. There would then be no 
occasion to resort to fairs, lotteries, or parties of pleasure to secure funds for 
the support of the gospel.”—AA 338.
Tithes and Offerings Not a Personal Trust Fund—Tithes and 
offerings donated by members to the Church do not create a trust fund for the 
future benefit of the givers. These funds shall be used for the current purposes 
for which they are given.
Financing Building Plans—Churches considering the purchase or 
erection of church or other buildings, or incurring debt of any kind, should 
counsel with conference officers before undertaking such financial 
obligations. In the purchase or building of church properties, in no case shall 
commitments be made or building operations begun until approval has been 
given by the conference and union committees. These committees will 
approve only after they have assured themselves that the financial 
arrangements conform to established policies. In giving financial counsel, the 
conference executive committee should consider the size of the congregation, 
its financial strength, and the location of the building.
Handling and Accounting for Funds—The gathering and handling of 
funds for the Lord’s work is a sacred responsibility. The proper channel 
through which these funds flow is first from members to the local church, 
where the treasurer receives the funds. (See pp. 88-91.) The treasurer 
disburses funds intended for local church purposes. The treasurer holds in 
trust and passes on to the conference treasurer funds intended for conference 
or general purposes. The treasurer of the local church works under the 
direction of the board. Treasurers of any level (local church, conference, 
union, or division/General Conference) do not act independently. They 
disburse funds only by action or authority of responsible committees.
Auditing—Every set of accounting records, from those of the local 
church to those of the General Conference, are subject to audit by auditors 
appointed for the purpose. This rule, which also applies to every 
denominationally affiliated institution, provides the maximum of safety in the 
handling of funds. (See p. 91.)
