  <h2>Lesson 28 - The Law of God</h2>
  <p>The Bible reveals two types of laws instituted by God: <strong>physical law</strong> and <strong>moral law</strong>.</p>

  <h3>1. Physical Law in Nature</h3>
  <p>God created the universe to operate in order and harmony through physical laws.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genesis 1:11</strong> - "Then God said, 'Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind…'"</li>
    <li><strong>Genesis 1:14-18</strong> - "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night… for signs and seasons, and for days and years."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Scientific advancement such as space exploration depends on understanding these laws, reflecting their divine origin.</p>

  <h3>2. Moral Law: The Ten Commandments</h3>
  <p>God gave humanity the <strong>Ten Commandments</strong> as His moral law (Exodus 20:1-17).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Romans 7:12</strong> - "Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good."</li>
    <li><strong>1 John 5:2-3</strong> - "For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome."</li>
    <li><strong>Ecclesiastes 12:13</strong> - "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is man’s all."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first four commandments relate to our duty to God, and the last six to our duty to fellow human beings.</p>

  <h3>3. The Nature of the Ten Commandments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Psalm 119:96</strong> - "I have seen the consummation of all perfection, but Your commandment is exceedingly broad."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The law, though brief, covers every principle necessary for righteous living.</p>

  <h3>4. God and the Commandments</h3>
  <p>The law reflects God's own nature:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1 Peter 1:16</strong> - "Be holy, for I am holy."</li>
    <li><strong>Revelation 15:3</strong> - "...Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints."</li>
    <li><strong>Romans 7:14</strong> - "For we know that the law is spiritual..."</li>
    <li><strong>Matthew 5:21-22</strong> - Jesus emphasizes that sin begins in the heart, not just in actions.</li>
    <li><strong>1 John 4:8</strong> - "God is love."</li>
    <li><strong>Matthew 22:36-40</strong> - Jesus teaches the two great commandments: love for God and love for neighbor.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the Ten Commandments are not only prohibitive but also prescriptive—they call us to actively love.</p>

  <h4>a. First Table: Our Duty to God</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genesis 35:1-4</strong> - Jacob calls his family to remove foreign gods and purify themselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Genesis 2:1-3</strong> - God sanctifies the Sabbath day, a principle later included in the Ten Commandments.</li>
    <li><strong>Psalm 90:2</strong> - "From everlasting to everlasting, You are God."</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>b. Second Table: Our Duty to Others</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genesis 18:19</strong> - God commends Abraham for teaching righteousness and justice.</li>
    <li><strong>Genesis 4:8-11</strong> - The story of Cain and Abel shows early understanding of murder as sin.</li>
    <li><strong>Genesis 39:7-9</strong> - Joseph resists temptation because of loyalty to God's moral law.</li>
    <li><strong>Genesis 44:8</strong> - Joseph’s brothers speak of honesty regarding stolen property.</li>
    <li><strong>Genesis 12:11-13</strong> - Abraham’s deception shows an early recognition of right and wrong.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. The Function of the Ten Commandments</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1 John 3:4</strong> - "Sin is the transgression of the law."</li>
    <li><strong>Romans 7:7</strong> - "I would not have known sin except through the law."</li>
    <li><strong>Romans 2:17-18</strong> - The law reveals God’s will.</li>
    <li><strong>Psalm 40:8</strong> - "I delight to do Your will, O my God, and Your law is within my heart."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The law convicts us of sin and points us to Christ, who is the only Savior from sin.</p>

  <h3>6. The Inward Law</h3>
  <p>God's desire is not merely outward obedience, but transformation of the heart.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hebrews 8:8-10</strong> - "I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts."</li>
    <li><strong>Isaiah 51:7</strong> - "You who know righteousness, in whose heart is My law..."</li>
    <li><strong>Romans 13:8-10</strong> - Love is the fulfillment of the law.</li>
    <li><strong>Galatians 5:14, 22</strong> - Love is the fruit of the Spirit and fulfills the whole law.</li>
    <li><strong>James 2:8-12</strong> - The law of liberty will be the standard of judgment.</li>
    <li><strong>Matthew 25:31-46</strong> - Jesus describes the final judgment, based on acts of love.</li>
    <li><strong>John 15:1-8</strong> - The believer must abide in Christ to bear the fruit of obedience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When we love God and others, obedience becomes a joyful expression of that love. The law then becomes written not just on stone, but in the heart.</p>

Lesson 28 – The Law of God

The Bible reveals that God has instituted two kinds of laws: physical law and moral law. Physical laws govern the natural world, while moral laws guide human behavior. These laws are not only meant to bring order but also to reflect God’s divine nature.
First, let’s consider the physical law in nature. God designed the universe to operate in harmony and order through established physical laws. For instance, in Genesis 1:11, God commands the earth to bring forth vegetation, each according to its kind. Later, in Genesis 1:14-18, He sets the lights in the heavens to mark days, seasons, and years. These scriptures show us that from the beginning, God built the world with structure. Scientific advances such as space exploration are possible because of these physical laws, which ultimately point to their divine origin.
Secondly, we look at the moral law, especially the Ten Commandments given to humanity. This moral code is found in Exodus 20:1-17 and is affirmed throughout the Bible. Romans 7:12 describes the law as holy, just, and good. First John 5:2-3 reminds us that loving God involves keeping His commandments, and these are not burdensome. Ecclesiastes 12:13 sums it up well: fearing God and keeping His commandments is the whole duty of man. The Ten Commandments are divided into two sections: the first four focus on our duty to God, and the remaining six emphasize our duty to our fellow humans.
The nature of these commandments is profound, even though the words are few. Psalm 119:96 says that God’s commandment is exceedingly broad, meaning it encompasses all that is needed for righteous living. The commandments reflect God's character and His call for us to mirror His holiness. As 1 Peter 1:16 says, “Be holy, for I am holy.” Revelation 15:3 declares that God’s ways are just and true. Romans 7:14 explains that the law is spiritual. Jesus also taught that sin begins in the heart, not just in actions, as shown in Matthew 5:21-22. Ultimately, the commandments are about love—because God is love, as 1 John 4:8 says. In Matthew 22:36-40, Jesus summed up the entire law in two great commandments: love for God and love for your neighbor.
The first table of the Ten Commandments teaches us our duty to God. For example, in Genesis 35:1-4, Jacob calls his family to put away foreign gods and purify themselves. In Genesis 2:1-3, God sanctifies the Sabbath day, setting an example for humanity. Psalm 90:2 reminds us of God's eternal nature—He is God from everlasting to everlasting.
The second table focuses on our duty to others. In Genesis 18:19, God commends Abraham for teaching his household righteousness and justice. The story of Cain and Abel in Genesis 4 reveals early understanding of the seriousness of murder. In Genesis 39, Joseph resists temptation out of loyalty to God’s moral standards. Joseph's brothers, in Genesis 44:8, display honesty concerning stolen goods. Even Abraham’s deception in Genesis 12 shows that people had a sense of right and wrong from early times.
The Ten Commandments also serve specific functions. According to 1 John 3:4, sin is defined as breaking the law. Romans 7:7 explains that the law helps us recognize sin, and Romans 2:17-18 tells us the law reveals God’s will. Psalm 40:8 expresses a deep desire to do God’s will and to have His law written in our hearts. The law convicts us of our sin and points us to Jesus Christ, who is the only Savior from sin.
Beyond external obedience, God desires a transformation of the heart—a law written inwardly. Hebrews 8:8-10 states that God will write His laws in our minds and hearts. Isaiah 51:7 speaks of those who have God's law in their hearts. Romans 13 and Galatians 5 tell us that love fulfills the law and is the fruit of the Spirit. James 2 calls it the law of liberty and reminds us that it will be the standard in judgment. In Matthew 25, Jesus explains that the final judgment will be based on acts of love—feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick. John 15 speaks about abiding in Christ, so we can bear the fruit of obedience.
When we truly love God and love others, obedience to His commandments becomes joyful, not burdensome. The law is no longer just a set of written instructions—it becomes part of who we are, written not just on stone tablets, but on our hearts.

  <h2>Lesson 29 - The Sabbath in the Old Testament</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Origin of the Sabbath</h3>
  <p>
    The origin of the Sabbath is revealed in the Bible, and it is emphasized that the Sabbath was made specifically for mankind, not just for Israel.
    <br>
    <strong>Mark 2:27:</strong> “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.”
    <br>
    The Sabbath was established at the end of the creation week by God through three distinct acts: resting, blessing, and sanctifying.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 2:1-3:</strong> “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Sabbath from Creation to Sinai</h3>
  <p>
    The Sabbath was known and observed by the Israelites even before the giving of the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai. An example of its observance can be found in the story of the manna, where God instructed the Israelites to gather double portions on the sixth day and rest on the seventh.
    <br>
    <strong>Exodus 16:22-26:</strong> “On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers apiece. And all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses. And he said to them, ‘This is what the Lord has commanded: Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord.’”
    <br>
    When God delivered the Ten Commandments at Sinai, the command to observe the Sabbath was included in the heart of the Decalogue.
    <br>
    <strong>Exodus 20:8-11:</strong> “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”
    <br>
    The Sabbath is not introduced as something new but as an institution that they were already familiar with, to be remembered as a memorial of God’s creation of the world.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Sabbath and the Nation of Israel</h3>
  <p>
    The Israelites’ observance of the Sabbath was a central part of their identity and relationship with God. When they violated the Sabbath during their wilderness journey, it provoked God’s anger.
    <br>
    <strong>Ezekiel 20:13:</strong> “But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness... they did not walk in my statutes, but rejected my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live... and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned.”
    <br>
    The Sabbath was to be regarded as a holy day and was not to be used for selfish purposes.
    <br>
    <strong>Isaiah 58:13-14:</strong> “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight and the holy day of the Lord honorable... then you shall take delight in the Lord, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth.”
  </p>

  <h3>4. Important Truths Taught by the Sabbath</h3>
  <p>
    The Sabbath served as a powerful reminder of God’s creation of the world and was intended to be a foundation for true worship. Through the Sabbath, the Israelites were called to worship and obey God as their Creator.
    <br>
    <strong>Exodus 20:8-11:</strong> “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”
    <br>
    The Sabbath also served as a sign of God's sanctifying power. It reminded Israel that they were to be a holy people, set apart from the world. The sanctifying power of God was symbolized in their observance of the Sabbath.
    <br>
    <strong>Exodus 31:13:</strong> “You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, ‘Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you.’”
    <br>
    The Sabbath was a continual sign that Israel was God’s people and that Jehovah was their God, the Creator who was able to re-create and sanctify them.
    <br>
    <strong>Exodus 20:2:</strong> “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The Sabbath was not only a day of rest but also a profound spiritual symbol. It marked God's completed work of creation and served as a reminder that, as God created the world, He was also the one who sanctified and renewed His people. The observance of the Sabbath is not just a ritual but a sign of a deeper relationship with God.
  </p>

            
            <!-- 
Lesson 29 – The Sabbath in the Old Testament

The Sabbath finds its origin in the Bible. It is emphasized that the Sabbath was not made solely for the Israelites but for all mankind. As stated in Mark 2:27, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." This shows its universal significance. The foundation of the Sabbath was laid at the end of creation when God rested, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day. According to Genesis 2:1-3, after completing His work of creation, God rested on the seventh day, blessed it, and made it holy. This act established the Sabbath as a divine institution from the very beginning.
The observance of the Sabbath did not begin at Mount Sinai. It was already known and practiced by the Israelites before the Ten Commandments were given. A clear example is found in Exodus 16, where God commanded the Israelites to gather double portions of manna on the sixth day and to rest on the seventh. This instruction came before the giving of the law at Sinai. When the Ten Commandments were delivered, the command to keep the Sabbath holy was included, not as a new concept but as a reminder. Exodus 20:8-11 reinforces this by linking Sabbath observance to God’s creative work. Thus, the Sabbath was meant to be remembered as a memorial of creation, not introduced as a new command.
For the nation of Israel, the Sabbath was more than a day of rest—it was central to their identity and relationship with God. When the Israelites violated the Sabbath during their wilderness journey, it provoked God’s anger. Ezekiel 20:13 speaks of their rebellion and how they profaned God's Sabbaths. The Sabbath was meant to be holy and not used for personal gain or pleasure. Isaiah 58:13-14 calls the Sabbath a delight and urges people to honor it by refraining from doing their own will, promising blessings in return for such observance.
The Sabbath teaches several important truths. It reminds us that God is the Creator of the universe, and it calls us to worship and obey Him. As repeated in Exodus 20:8-11, the Sabbath commemorates God's creation. It also symbolizes God's power to sanctify His people. In Exodus 31:13, God tells Israel that keeping the Sabbath is a sign between Him and them, showing that He is the one who makes them holy. The Sabbath served as a continual sign that Israel was set apart for God, that He was their Redeemer and Creator, capable of sanctifying and renewing them.
In conclusion, the Sabbath was not only a physical rest but a profound spiritual symbol. It marked the completion of God’s creation and reminded the people of Israel that the same God who created the world was also working to sanctify and restore His people. Observing the Sabbath went beyond ritual—it reflected a deeper relationship with the Lord.

  <h2>Lesson 30 - The Sabbath in the New Testament</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Christ and the Sabbath</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Luke 4:16:</strong> “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.”
    <br>
    This verse shows that it was Jesus' regular custom to attend synagogue and observe the Sabbath.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Mark 2:28:</strong> “Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.”
    <br>
    Jesus declared His authority over the Sabbath, affirming its continued importance and His rightful place as its Lord.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Matthew 12:9-14:</strong> In this passage, Jesus heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath. He says:
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 12:12:</strong> “Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.”
    <br>
    Christ emphasized the true spirit of the Sabbath—doing good and showing mercy, not rigid restriction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Matthew 24:20:</strong> “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.”
    <br>
    This shows that Jesus expected His followers to continue honoring the Sabbath even after His death and resurrection.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Luke 23:50-56:</strong> After Christ’s crucifixion, His followers observed the Sabbath by resting:
    <br>
    <strong>Luke 23:56:</strong> “And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.”
    <br>
    Just as God rested after creation, Christ rested in the tomb on the Sabbath after completing His redemptive work.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Disciples and the Sabbath</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Matthew 28:1 (RSV):</strong> “Now after the sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.”
    <br>
    This highlights that the resurrection occurred after the Sabbath, confirming that the Sabbath had ended and the first day of the week had begun.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Mark 16:1:</strong> “And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices...”
    <br>
    The women did not go to the tomb on the Sabbath but waited until after it had passed, showing their continued observance.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Luke 23:50-56:</strong> Again, it is emphasized that the disciples “rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Luke 24:1:</strong> “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre...”
    <br>
    The first day was treated as ordinary; there is no evidence of it being treated as a holy day.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Acts 13:14, 42-44:</strong> Paul and his companions worshiped on the Sabbath:
    <br>
    “But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.”
    <br>
    “And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Acts 16:13:</strong> “And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made...”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Acts 17:1-2:</strong> “...Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Acts 18:1-4, 11:</strong> Paul stayed in Corinth a year and a half, reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath:
    <br>
    “And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Revelation 1:10:</strong> “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day...”
    <br>
    While some interpret "the Lord’s Day" as Sunday, Scripture identifies the Sabbath (seventh day) as the Lord’s Day.
  </p>

  <h4>Supporting Scriptures for the Sabbath as the Lord’s Day:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mark 2:28:</strong> “The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.”</li>
    <li><strong>Isaiah 58:13:</strong> “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath... and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord...”</li>
    <li><strong>Exodus 20:11:</strong> “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The New Testament shows clear continuity in Sabbath observance. Neither Christ nor His disciples taught or practiced a change from the seventh-day Sabbath to the first day of the week. The Sabbath remains a memorial of both creation and redemption, as demonstrated by Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
  </p>

            
            <!-- 
Lesson 30 – The Sabbath in the New Testament

Today, we explore the Sabbath through the lens of the New Testament, beginning with Christ's own relationship with the Sabbath.

1. Christ and the Sabbath
In Luke 4:16, we read that Jesus went to the synagogue on the Sabbath, as was His custom. This shows that observing the Sabbath was a regular part of His life. In Mark 2:28, Jesus declares, “The Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath,” affirming not only the continued relevance of the Sabbath but also His authority over it.
In Matthew 12:9-14, Jesus heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath. He reminds us in verse 12 that “it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days.” Through this, He emphasized the true spirit of the Sabbath—not strict restriction, but acts of mercy and goodness.
Later, in Matthew 24:20, Jesus told His followers to pray that their flight would not be on the Sabbath. This shows that He anticipated continued observance of the Sabbath even after His resurrection. In Luke 23:56, after Christ's crucifixion, His followers rested on the Sabbath, following the commandment. Just as God rested after creation, Christ rested in the tomb after completing His redemptive work.

2. The Disciples and the Sabbath
Matthew 28:1 tells us that the resurrection occurred “after the Sabbath,” and Mark 16:1 confirms that the women waited until the Sabbath had passed before visiting the tomb. This shows that Jesus’ followers still honored the Sabbath even after His death.
Luke 23:50-56 again highlights that the disciples rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment. Then in Luke 24:1, we see that the first day of the week was treated as ordinary—there is no indication it was observed as a special or holy day.
In the Book of Acts, we see the apostles continuing Sabbath observance. Acts 13:14, 42-44 shows Paul and his companions preaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath. The next Sabbath, nearly the entire city gathered to hear the Word of God. In Acts 16:13, Paul and others went out to a place of prayer on the Sabbath. Acts 17:1-2 reveals that it was Paul’s custom to reason with people in the synagogue on three consecutive Sabbaths. In Acts 18:1-4, 11, Paul spent a year and a half in Corinth, reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuading both Jews and Greeks.
One notable verse is Revelation 1:10, where John says, “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day.” While some interpret this to mean Sunday, Scripture consistently identifies the Sabbath—the seventh day—as the Lord’s Day.
Supporting Scriptures for the Sabbath as the Lord’s Day
In Mark 2:28, Jesus clearly states, “The Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” Isaiah 58:13 calls the Sabbath “the holy of the Lord.” Exodus 20:11 tells us that the Lord created the world in six days and rested on the seventh, blessing and hallowing the Sabbath day.

Conclusion
The New Testament demonstrates a clear continuity in Sabbath observance. Neither Jesus nor His disciples taught or practiced a change from the seventh day to the first day of the week. The Sabbath remains a powerful reminder of both creation and redemption, underscored by Christ’s example and His rest in the tomb. It continues to serve as a day set apart for worship, reflection, and doing good.

  <h2>Lesson 31 - Sunday in the Scriptures</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The First Day of the Week in the Old Testament</h3>
  <p>
    The first day of the week is not distinguished or given religious significance in the Old Testament. It is treated as one of the regular working days.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Genesis 1:3–5:</strong> “And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light... And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.”
    <br>
    The text simply describes creation without attaching any sacred importance to the first day.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Ezekiel 46:1:</strong> “Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened.”
    <br>
    Here, the first day is grouped with the “six working days,” further showing its ordinary status.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The First Day of the Week in the New Testament</h3>
  <p>
    Some believe Jesus and His disciples changed the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first. Others believe Sunday observance began after Christ’s resurrection. This section examines all New Testament references to the first day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term "Sunday" is not used in the Bible. Jews only named the seventh day (Sabbath); the others were numbered.
    <br>
    For example, in Portuguese: Sunday = "Domingo", Monday = "Segunda Feira", and Saturday = "Sábado".
  </p>

  <h4>Matthew 28:1</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>KJV:</strong> “In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.”
    <br>
    <strong>RSV:</strong> “Now after the sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week...”
    <br>
    This shows that the first day comes *after* the Sabbath. The women did not treat it as a rest or worship day—they went to do work (prepare Jesus' body).
  </p>

  <h4>Mark 16:1–2</h4>
  <p>
    “And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre.”
    <br>
    Again, no religious importance is attached; rather, the women engaged in burial preparation.
  </p>

  <h4>Mark 16:9</h4>
  <p>
    “Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene...”
    <br>
    The verse records Christ’s resurrection on the first day, but there is no command or indication of a religious observance.
  </p>

  <h4>Luke 24:1</h4>
  <p>
    “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared...”
    <br>
    The account aligns with the others—no special day of worship is indicated.
  </p>

  <h4>John 20:1</h4>
  <p>
    “The first day of the week comes Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre...”
    <br>
    John reaffirms the narrative without assigning sacred significance to the day.
  </p>

  <h4>John 20:19</h4>
  <p>
    “Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews...”
    <br>
    The gathering was not for worship but due to fear. No religious title or observance is connected to the day. John's Gospel, written late in the first century, still doesn’t name the day religiously.
  </p>

  <h4>Acts 20:7</h4>
  <p>
    “And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them...”
    <br>
    This is the only recorded religious meeting on the first day. However, context shows it was a <em>farewell meeting</em> held on what we now call Saturday night:
    <br>
    <strong>Acts 20:8–11:</strong> The meeting extended through the night, ending at daybreak. Paul continued his journey the next day.
  </p>

  <h4>1 Corinthians 16:2</h4>
  <p>
    “Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him...”
    <br>
    This instruction refers to <strong>private collection of donations</strong>, not a church service. The offerings were set aside at home, not gathered in assembly.
  </p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p>
    Based on the biblical evidence, there is <strong>no command or example</strong> in Scripture that designates the first day of the week (Sunday) as a sacred day of rest or worship. All references to the first day in the New Testament are either descriptive (such as the resurrection) or incidental (like Paul’s farewell meeting).

Lesson 31 - Sunday in the Scriptures
Date: Saturday, November 25, 2023

Let us begin by understanding the role of the first day of the week in the Bible. In the Old Testament, the first day of the week is not given any special religious significance. It is treated just like any other working day.

In Genesis chapter 1, verses 3 to 5, we read: “And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light... And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.” This passage simply describes the creation process without suggesting that the first day is sacred.

In Ezekiel 46 verse 1, God says, “The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened.” This shows clearly that the first day is considered one of the six regular working days.

Now let's look at the New Testament. Some people believe that Jesus and His disciples changed the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day. Others believe that Sunday worship began after Jesus rose from the dead. To understand this better, we will examine every New Testament reference to the first day of the week.

It is important to note that the Bible does not use the word "Sunday." In Jewish tradition, only the seventh day—the Sabbath—is named. The other days are simply numbered. For example, in Portuguese, Sunday is called “Domingo,” Monday is “Segunda Feira,” and Saturday is “Sábado.”
In Matthew 28 verse 1, the Bible says, “Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.” This shows the first day follows the Sabbath. The women did not treat this day as holy—they went to perform work by preparing Jesus’ body.
Mark 16, verses 1 to 2 says: “When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week, they went to the tomb.” Again, no religious observance is shown. They were doing practical work.
In Mark 16 verse 9, we are told, “Jesus rose early on the first day of the week and appeared first to Mary Magdalene.” While this tells us that Jesus rose on the first day, there is no command or teaching that the day should be treated as sacred.
Luke 24 verse 1 also says: “On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.” Like the other accounts, this passage shows the first day as a time for activity, not rest or worship.
In John 20 verse 1, it says: “Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb.” Once again, there is no mention of the day being set aside as special or holy.
Later in John 20 verse 19, we read that on the same day, in the evening, the disciples were gathered together, but it says they met behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jews. This meeting was not a worship service—it was a gathering out of fear. Even though John's Gospel was written late in the first century, the first day is still not presented as a religious observance.
In Acts 20 verse 7, we finally see a religious meeting on the first day. It says, “On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them.” However, this was a special occasion—a farewell meeting. The next few verses tell us it happened at night and continued until dawn, after which Paul left on his journey. This suggests the meeting took place on what we would now call Saturday night.
In 1 Corinthians 16 verse 2, Paul instructs, “On the first day of the week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper.” This is not a command for a worship service. Rather, it is a personal act of setting aside offerings at home, not a church gathering.
In conclusion, there is no command in the Bible that sets aside the first day of the week—Sunday—as a sacred day of rest or worship. All references to the first day in the New Testament are either describing events, such as Jesus’ resurrection, or are incidental, such as a farewell gathering or private giving. The biblical evidence does not support the idea that Sunday is a holy day.

  <h2>Lesson 32 - The Change of the Sabbath</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. A Change of the Sabbath Indicated in Prophecy</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible prophesies a power that would attempt to change divine laws, specifically those dealing with time. 
    <strong>Daniel 7:25</strong> (RSV) says: 
    <q>“He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law…”</q><br>
    The Ten Commandments, found in <strong>Exodus 20:3–17</strong>, include only one command that deals with time—the fourth commandment:<br>
    <q>“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God…”</q> (Exodus 20:8–10).
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Little-Horn Symbol Identified</h3>
  <p>
    The “little horn” in Daniel’s vision represents a power that arises from the fourth beast (Rome) and seeks to oppose God. 
    <strong>Daniel 7:8</strong> describes it: 
    <q>“...behold, there came up among them another little horn... and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.”</q><br>
    The apostle Paul further elaborates on this power in <strong>2 Thessalonians 2:3–4</strong>: 
    <q>“Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship...”</q><br>
    Many scholars and Bible students understand this “man of sin” and “little horn” to refer to the papal system, which rose to religious dominance after the fall of the Roman Empire.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Claims of the Papacy</h3>
  
  <h4>a. Authority to Change Divine Laws</h4>
  <p>
    The Roman Catholic Church openly claims the authority to change divine laws. As stated in the <em>Ecclesiastical Dictionary</em> (Ferrarias, article “Papa,” Rome, 1890):<br>
    <q>“The pope is of so great authority and power that he can modify, explain, or interpret even divine laws... he acts as a vicegerent of God upon earth...”</q>
  </p>

  <h4>b. The Change of the Sabbath</h4>
  <p>
    The Church acknowledges it changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. In <em>Plain Talk About the Protestantism of Today</em>, Mgr. Segur wrote:<br>
    <q>“It was the Catholic Church which, by the authority of Jesus Christ, has transferred this rest to the Sunday...”</q><br><br>

    The <em>Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine</em> (Rev. Peter Geierman, 2nd ed., 1910, p. 50) confirms:<br>
    <q>“Ques. Which is the Sabbath day? Ans. Saturday is the Sabbath day. Ques. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday? Ans. Because the Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.”</q><br><br>

    Similarly, <em>A Doctrinal Catechism</em> by Rev. Stephen Keenan states:<br>
    <q>“She could not have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.”</q>
  </p>

  <h4>c. Changes in the Ten Commandments</h4>
  <p>
    A comparative study of Catholic catechisms reveals the following alterations in the Ten Commandments:
    <ol>
      <li>The second commandment, which forbids the making and worship of images (<strong>Exodus 20:4–6</strong>), is often omitted or merged with the first.</li>
      <li>The tenth commandment is split into two to maintain the count of ten.</li>
      <li>The fourth commandment is renumbered as the third, and its wording altered to refer to Sunday observance without specifying the seventh day as the Sabbath.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The change of the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday is acknowledged by the Roman Catholic Church as an exercise of ecclesiastical authority, not based on Scripture. 
    Bible prophecy in Daniel and Paul’s writings foresaw such changes and identified the power responsible. 
    For believers in the authority of Scripture, this lesson underscores the importance of examining tradition in light of God’s Word.

Lesson 32 – The Change of the Sabbath

Today’s lesson explores the biblical and historical background behind the change of the Sabbath day from Saturday to Sunday. We'll begin by looking at prophecy, identifying key powers mentioned in Scripture, and examining claims made by the Roman Catholic Church regarding this change.

1. A Change of the Sabbath Indicated in Prophecy
The Bible contains a prophecy about a power that would attempt to change divine laws—specifically those related to time. Daniel chapter 7, verse 25, tells us that this power will speak against the Most High, wear out the saints, and think to change the times and the law. Among the Ten Commandments found in Exodus chapter 20, only one commandment deals with time—that is the fourth commandment. It says, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy… the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” This commandment highlights Saturday as the holy day of rest.

2. The Little-Horn Symbol Identified
In Daniel’s vision, a symbol called the “little horn” arises from the fourth beast, which represents Rome. This little horn is described as having eyes like a man and a mouth that speaks boastfully. Daniel chapter 7, verse 8, provides this description. The apostle Paul builds on this prophecy in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2, saying that a man of sin will arise—one who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God. Many Bible scholars identify this little horn and man of sin as the papal system that rose to religious power after the fall of the Roman Empire.

3. The Claims of the Papacy
Let’s look at some of the claims made by the Roman Catholic Church:
a. Authority to Change Divine Laws
The Catholic Church claims that the pope has the authority to change even divine laws. According to the Ecclesiastical Dictionary, the pope is said to have such great power that he can modify or interpret God's laws, acting as a representative of God on earth.
b. The Change of the Sabbath
The Church openly admits to changing the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. In the book Plain Talk About the Protestantism of Today, Mgr. Segur writes that the Catholic Church, by the authority of Jesus Christ, transferred the rest day to Sunday. This is confirmed in the Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine, which plainly states that Saturday is the Sabbath day, but Sunday is observed instead because the Church transferred the solemnity to that day. Similarly, A Doctrinal Catechism by Rev. Stephen Keenan acknowledges that this change was made without any Scriptural authority.
c. Changes in the Ten Commandments
A review of Catholic catechisms shows some modifications to the Ten Commandments. The second commandment, which forbids making and worshiping images, is often removed or merged with the first. The tenth commandment is then split into two parts to maintain the number ten. Additionally, the fourth commandment becomes the third in their version, and its wording is changed to refer to Sunday observance, rather than the seventh-day Sabbath as originally stated.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the change of the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday is acknowledged by the Roman Catholic Church as an act of its own authority, not one supported by Scripture. Bible prophecy in Daniel and Paul’s letters predicted this change and identified the power behind it. For those who seek to follow God’s Word faithfully, this serves as a reminder to always examine religious traditions in the light of Scripture.

    <h2>Lesson 33 - Seal of God - Mark of the Beast</h2>
    <p></p>
    
    <h3>1. The Sealing of God’s Servants</h3>
    <p>Before the final judgments of God fall upon the earth, the servants of God are to be sealed with “the seal of the living God.” This is described in Revelation 7:1-3:</p>
    <blockquote>"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree. Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, with the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea, saying, 'Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.'” (Rev. 7:1-3)</blockquote>

    <h3>2. The Seal of the Living God</h3>
    <p>The seal of God symbolizes His ownership and marks the people who are His. The sealed individuals are recognized as belonging to God. In Revelation 7:4, we see the number of those sealed as 144,000:</p>
    <blockquote>"And I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:" (Rev. 7:4)</blockquote>
    <p>The seal of God in the forehead is equivalent to God’s name, indicating His character. Only those who reflect God's character in their lives are sealed (Ex. 31:13; Ezek. 20:12). The observance of the Sabbath, as highlighted in Revelation 14:6-7, is an outward sign of sanctification:</p>
    <blockquote>"Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people. And he said with a loud voice, 'Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.'" (Rev. 14:6-7)</blockquote>

    <h3>3. The Mark of the Beast</h3>
    <p>At the same time that the faithful are sealed, others receive the mark of the beast. Revelation 14:9-11 warns about receiving this mark:</p>
    <blockquote>"And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink the wine of God’s wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.'" (Rev. 14:9-11)</blockquote>
    <p>The beast referred to in Revelation 13:1, which has ten horns, is identified with Rome and particularly its papal form. The papacy is said to have a period of supremacy lasting 1260 years (Rev. 13:5), from A.D. 538 to 1798:</p>
    <blockquote>"And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months." (Rev. 13:5)</blockquote>
    <p>The mark of the beast is symbolized by a mark or sign of allegiance to a system that reflects the authority of the papacy. Revelation 13:16-17 talks about how this mark is enforced:</p>
    <blockquote>"Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name." (Rev. 13:16-17)</blockquote>

    <h3>4. The People of God Victorious</h3>
    <p>Revelation 14:9-11 contrasts two groups of worshipers: those who worship the beast and its image, and the saints who worship God. The faithful will receive victory, as described in Revelation 15:2-4:</p>
    <blockquote>"And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire—and also those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands." (Rev. 15:2-4)</blockquote>
    <p>Those who refuse to worship the beast or receive its mark will be victorious and will be spared from the plagues that fall upon the worshipers of the beast (Rev. 16:2). The distinction between the two groups is summarized as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>"Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus." (Rev. 14:12)</blockquote>
    <p>The saints are those who observe God's commandments, including the Sabbath, while those who worship the beast observe a substitute day, showing allegiance to the papacy. The final test of loyalty will be based on the observance of the true Sabbath (GC 605).</p>

            
            <!-- 
Lesson 33 – Seal of God - Mark of the Beast

In this lesson, we explore the sealing of God's servants and the mark of the beast. Before the final judgments of God are executed upon the earth, the servants of God will be sealed with the "seal of the living God." This event is described in Revelation 7:1-3, where we read that four angels stand at the four corners of the earth, holding back the winds until God's servants are sealed. The angel ascending from the east, with the seal of God, commands them to hold off from causing harm until the servants of God are marked on their foreheads.
The seal of God represents His ownership, indicating that the people who bear it belong to Him. In Revelation 7:4, we are told that 144,000 are sealed from the tribes of Israel. The seal on their foreheads is synonymous with God's name, showing that they reflect His character. To be sealed by God, one must exhibit His attributes, including the observance of the Sabbath, which serves as an outward sign of sanctification, as emphasized in Revelation 14:6-7. This passage calls for the worship of God, the Creator of heaven and earth, as the hour of judgment has arrived.
At the same time that the faithful are sealed, another group receives the mark of the beast. Revelation 14:9-11 warns about receiving this mark, which is associated with worshiping the beast and its image. Those who accept the mark will face God's wrath, suffering torment in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb. The beast mentioned in Revelation 13:1 is associated with Rome, specifically its papal form. This power is said to have a period of dominance lasting 1260 years, from A.D. 538 to 1798, as stated in Revelation 13:5.
The mark of the beast symbolizes allegiance to a system that reflects the authority of the papacy. Revelation 13:16-17 explains how this mark will be enforced. It will be required for everyone, regardless of status, to receive the mark on their right hand or forehead. Without it, people will be unable to buy or sell. This mark represents the name of the beast or the number of its name.
Finally, Revelation 14:9-11 contrasts those who worship the beast and those who worship God. While those who worship the beast will face judgment, the faithful will be victorious, as described in Revelation 15:2-4. These victorious saints stand beside the sea of glass, having conquered the beast and its image, holding harps in their hands. They will be spared from the plagues that fall upon those who follow the beast. Revelation 14:12 sums up the distinction: “Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.” The saints will observe God's commandments, including the true Sabbath, while those who worship the beast will observe a substitute day, showing their allegiance to the papacy. The final test of loyalty will center on the observance of the true Sabbath
