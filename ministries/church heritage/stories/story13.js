<h2>Communication</h2>

<p><em>The mission statement of the Communication Department is “building bridges of hope.”</em> This is being accomplished by reaching the diverse church audiences, both within and externally, with an open, responsible, and hope-filled communication program, and through the effective use of contemporary technologies and methods of communication.</p>

<p>The desired effect of the Adventist communication vision and activities is to create a favorable image of the church, its mission, life, activities, and witness, so that many will become followers of Christ and members of His church.</p>

<p>The Communication Department of the General Conference dates back to 1972, when it was transformed from the former Bureau of Public Relations and the Radio-Television Department. Now, the department has these basic functions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>News and information</li>
    <li>Public and media relations</li>
    <li>Online services</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes the operation of the <strong>Adventist News Network</strong>, a news agency established in 1994, as well as implementing the varied features of the church’s webpage on <a href="http://www.adventist.org">www.adventist.org</a>.</p>

<p>The department also oversees activities relating to the overall World Church communication strategy: <strong>“Seventh-day Adventists will communicate hope by focusing on the quality of life that is complete in Christ.”</strong></p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>The Education Department provides coordination and supervision to the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist educational system, from the elementary school to the university level. Adventist educational institutions promote the total development of their students– mental, spiritual, physical, and social– and actively support the mission of the church.</p>

<p>The first denominationally-sponsored Adventist elementary and secondary school began in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1872, and the first college opened in the same location in 1874. Since then, Adventists have established new schools, colleges, and universities in over one hundred countries, with more than one million students enrolled.</p>

<p>The Education Department publishes <em>The Journal of Adventist Education</em> in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. The department also supports the church’s ministry on behalf of Adventist students attending public colleges and universities by publishing <em>Dialogue</em>, which is distributed free to them in the same four languages.</p>

<h2>Family Life</h2>

<p>The over-arching objective of the Department of Family Ministries is to strengthen families as disciple-making centers. Established at creation, the family is the primary setting in which values are learned and the capacity for close relationships with God and with other human beings is developed. The department seeks to enable families to stretch toward divine ideals, while at the same time extending the good news of God’s saving grace and the promise of growth possible through the indwelling Spirit.</p>

<p>Family Ministries focuses on people in relationship and is concerned with the needs of married couples, parents and children, the family needs of singles, and all members of the wider family circle as they pass through life’s predictable stages and contend with unexpected changes in their lives.</p>

<p>The department fosters growth opportunities through family life education and marriage and family enrichment programs. It supports and encourages families and family members to avail themselves of professional counseling when necessary to provide healing from abuse or other trauma.</p>

<p>Specific tasks of the department include preparation of resources for <strong>Christian Home and Marriage Week</strong> and <strong>Family Togetherness Week</strong>, as well as resources and leadership development to equip pastors and lay leaders in a number of curricular content areas, such as premarital guidance, strengthening marriage, parent education, human sexuality, communication, and family evangelism.</p>

<h2>Global Mission</h2>

<p>Mission is the primary work of the church. As Seventh-day Adventists, we have a mandate to proclaim the name of Christ to every person in the world. To serve this objective, nothing is more cutting-edge than Global Mission.</p>

<p>In 1990, the world church created Global Mission, with the aim of establishing congregations in every unentered people group and territory in the world. From 1990 to 2000, the church has risen to meet the challenge. During this ten-year period, more than 15,000 new churches have been established, to say nothing of the additional thousands of new congregations. In 1990, our church was establishing one new church per day. In the year 2000, the church was establishing five new churches per day. The membership of the church has grown from 6 million to nearly 11 million members during the same time. Huge territories such as China, the former Soviet Union, India, and the Middle East have experienced explosive church growth. It is clear that these accomplishments are a result of the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Global Mission’s mandate is clear. However, the only way the church can hope to meet the challenge of mission is through each member’s involvement–<strong>your involvement</strong>. Pray every day that the Holy Spirit will continue to prepare and reap the harvest. Find a way to personally impact mission. Remember the AY Aim: <em>“The Advent Message to All the World in My Generation.”</em></p>

<h2>Health Ministries</h2>

    <li>To promote abstinence from harmful substances. Health Ministries seeks to establish, above all, relationships with people regardless of race, gender, age, or circumstances through which the healing power of God’s grace can be disseminated.</li>

<h2>Public Affairs and Religious Liberty</h2>

<h2>Publishing</h2>

<p>The <strong>Publishing Department</strong> is responsible for fostering the production and sale of Adventist evangelistic and nurturing literature as well as recruiting, training, and assisting literature evangelists with their work.</p>

<p>This, in a sense, is the oldest of departments, for the publishing work dates back to 1849. The first steam press was paid for by a farmer selling his oxen. George King was the first literature evangelist, beginning in 1878. Today, literature produced by fifty-eight publishing houses is being sold by 24,000 literature evangelists worldwide, totaling over one hundred million dollars annually, and accounts for more than 60,000 baptisms each year.</p>

<h2>Sabbath School and Personal Ministries</h2>

<p>It is the mission of the Sabbath School/Personal Ministries Department of the General Conference to provide resources and training coordination for Sabbath School and for membership involvement in soul-winning, and to promote world mission emphasis.</p>

<h3>Sabbath School</h3>
<p>The Sabbath School unit of the department has served the church for more than one hundred years. The mission of the Sabbath School unit is to provide religious education systems and materials for the local church that build faith and practice. It has four purposes:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Study of the Word</strong>, enabling members to study the Word of God systematically.</li>
    <li><strong>Fellowship</strong>, providing opportunity for social interaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Community outreach</strong>, teaching the gospel to those who do not know it.</li>
    <li><strong>World mission emphasis</strong>, making funds available for the worldwide expansion of the church.</li>
</ol>

<p>The department produces the Sabbath School Bible Study Guides in various editions for all age groups.</p>

<h3>Personal Ministries</h3>
<p>The mission of the Personal Ministries unit of the department is to motivate, equip, and mobilize the membership to accomplish the world mission of the church. Its responsibility is to organize and lead the church into service for Christ. It encourages evangelism, especially in many ways, such as lay training through the International Institute of Christian Ministries, Bible studies, Community Services activities, public evangelistic activities led by church members, and Bible correspondence courses.</p>

<h2>Stewardship</h2>

<h2>Women’s Ministries</h2>

<p>Women’s Ministries began in 1898 with the encouragement of Ellen G. White. However, it soon faded out because of the untimely death of the leader, Sarepta Myrenda (Irish) Henry. It was reactivated in 1990 and became a full department in 1995, so it is both one of the newest and oldest departments.</p>

<p>Women make up about 70% of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The spiritual growth of these women, regardless of age, is the first objective of Women’s Ministries, involving women ministering to and for women.</p>

<p>Women’s Ministries supports and works to elevate women as persons of inestimable worth because they have been created and redeemed. It strives to build networks among women in the world church to encourage bonds of friendship and mutual support and the creative exchange of ideas and information. This involves the publishing of a yearly devotional book, the profits of which go entirely to scholarships for women. It fosters the mentoring of young Adventist women, encouraging their involvement in the work of the church.</p>

<p>Women’s Ministries seeks to address the concerns of women in a global context, bringing women’s unique perspectives to the issues facing the world church; seeks to expand avenues of dynamic Christian service for women; challenges each Adventist woman to find and use her spiritual gifts, working together with the men to further the global mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p>

<h2>Youth Ministries</h2>

<p><strong>For several decades, this department was known as the Youth Department of Missionary Volunteers</strong> (abbreviated as MV Department). In 1985, five departments were merged together—Family Ministries, Personal Ministries, Sabbath School, Stewardship, and Youth—under the title of Church Ministries. This concept met with mixed success, and in 1995 some of the merged departments were again separated, with only Personal and Sabbath School Ministries staying together. Today, we’re again known as the Youth Department and are commonly referred to as Youth Ministries. Aspects of youth ministry that are attended to by this department include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adventurer Club (ages 6-9) with four age-related classes: Busy Bee, Sunbeam, Builder, and Helping Hand;</li>
  <li>AJY Society and Pathfinder Clubs (ages 10-15) with six age-related classes: Friend, Companion, Explorer, Ranger, Voyager, and Guide;</li>
  <li>AY Society and other young-adult-related organizations and activities designed for ages 16-30.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The purpose of the Youth Department</strong> is to aid in the harmonious development of the physical, mental, social, and spiritual life of the youth and to train and organize them for Christian service. The key expression that permeates all youth ministry-related activities is “Salvation and Service.”</p>

<p>How this phrase translates into activity is outlined in such publications as the “Youth Leaders Handbook,” “Camp Directors Manual,” “Pathfinder Administrative Manual,” “Adventurer Club Manual,” “Camporee and Fair Manual,” etc. The department also produces a quarterly publication called Youth Ministry Accent with materials designed for church youth leaders at all levels.</p>

<p>Various programs have been introduced through the years, each meeting the needs of the youth during the appropriate times. Some better-known ones are: Friendship Evangelism in the fifties, Tell Ten in the sixties, Festivals of Faith in the seventies, New Beginnings in the eighties, and ushering in the new millennium, a service-oriented program called Heart, Hand, and Mind.</p>

<p>Volunteerism took on new meaning and new directions beginning in the sixties with the Student Missionary program. First, colleges began sending students out as volunteers for several months or a year to help churches and institutions around the world. Then academies and Pathfinder Clubs began sending groups out on building projects or to spend time helping at schools or orphanages, running Vacation Bible Schools, and all sorts of other service-related activities from neighboring countries to local neighborhoods.</p>
