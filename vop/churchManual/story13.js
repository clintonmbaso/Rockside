                <h2>High Calling of God in Christ Jesus</h2>
                <p>The Christian’s life is not a slight modification or improvement, but a 
complete transformation of nature. This means a death to self and sin and a 
resurrection to a new life as a new person in Christ Jesus.
<p>The heart of the Christian becomes the dwelling place of Christ by faith. 
This is brought about by “the contemplation of Christ, beholding Christ, ever 
cherishing the dear Savior as our very best and honored Friend, so that we 
would not in any action grieve and offend Him”—TM 387. Thus Christians 
“have the companionship of the divine presence,” and as we realize that 
presence, “our thoughts are brought into captivity to Jesus Christ” (TM 388) 
and our habits made to conform to the divine standard.
<p>We should bear in mind that “as a shield from temptation and an 
inspiration to purity and truth, no other influence can equal the sense of God’s 
presence.”—Ed 255.
“No part of our conduct escapes observation. We cannot hide our ways 
from the Most High. . . . Every act, every word, every thought, is as distinctly 
marked as though there were only one person in the whole world, and the 
attention of heaven were centered upon him.”—PP 217, 218.
<p>God’s love extends to everyone, and to His children in particular. His ear 
is ever open to the appeals of His people, those who have turned from the 
world and given themselves to Him. Out of this sacred relationship grows a 
respect and a reverence that is manifested every day and everywhere.
<p>As Christians we are members of the royal family, children of the 
heavenly King. Therefore, we should say no word and perform no act that 
would bring dishonor upon “that noble name by which you are called” (James 
2:7). We are reformers. In every phase of life we should “study carefully the 
divine-human character and constantly inquire, ‘What would Jesus do were 
He in my place?’ This should be the measurement of our duty.”—MH 491.
<p>Through the remnant Church God will demonstrate to the entire universe 
the adequacy of the gospel to save men and women from the power of sin. 
As members of that Church we should emphasize again the great Bible 
standards and renew allegiance to these God-given principles. We should 
come up to the high standards of the Christian life and be separated from the 
world. To this end we would heed the Lord’s admonition: “Do not love the 
world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the 
Father is not in him” (1 John 2:15)

                <h2>Bible Study and Prayer</h2>
                <p>Spiritual life is maintained by spiritual food. We must maintain the habit 
of devotional Bible study and prayer if we are to perfect holiness. In a time 
when a flood of communication pours forth from the printed page, radio, 
television, the Internet, and other modern mass media, when thousands of 
voices plead for a hearing, we must close our eyes and our ears to much that 
seeks entrance to our minds and devote ourselves to God’s Book, the Book 
of all books, the Book of life—the Bible. If we cease to be the people of the 
Book, we are lost, and our mission has failed. Only as we daily talk to God 
in prayer and listen to His voice can we hope to live the life that is “hidden 
with Christ in God” (Col. 3:3) and finish His work.
<p>Prayer is a two-way conversation in which we listen to and talk to God. 
“Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend.”—SC 93. “Through 
sincere prayer we are brought into connection with the mind of the Infinite,” 
and “without unceasing prayer and diligent watching we are in danger of 
growing careless and of deviating from the right path.”—SC 97, 95.
<p>The home is the cornerstone of the Church. A Christian home is a house 
of prayer. “Fathers and mothers, however pressing your business, do not fail 
to gather your family around God’s altar. . . . Those who would live patient, 
loving, cheerful lives must pray.”—MH 393.

                <h2>Community Relationships</h2>
                <p>While our “citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for 
the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ” (Phil. 3:20), we are yet in the world as an 
integral part of human society and must share with our fellow citizens certain 
responsibilities in the common problems of life. Wherever we live, as 
children of God we should be recognized as outstanding citizens in our 
Christian integrity and in working for the common good.
<p>While our highest responsibility is to the Church and the gospel 
commission, we should support by our service and our means, as far as 
possible and consistent with our beliefs, efforts for social order and 
betterment. Even though we must stand apart from political and social strife, 
we should always, quietly and firmly, maintain an uncompromising stand for 
justice and right in civic affairs, along with full adherence to our religious 
convictions. It is our sacred responsibility to be loyal citizens of the nations 
to which we belong, rendering “to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to 
God the things that are God’s” (Matt. 22:21).

                <h2>Sabbathkeeping</h2>
                <p>The Sabbath is a token of God’s love to humanity. It is a memorial of 
God’s power in the original creation and also a sign of His power to re-create
and sanctify our lives (Eze. 20:12), and its observance is an evidence of our 
loyalty to Him and of our fellowship with Him.
<p>The Sabbath holds a special place in our lives. The seventh day of the 
week, from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday (Lev. 23:32), is a gift from God, 
a sign of His grace in time. It is a privilege, a special appointment with the 
One who loves us and whom we love, a sacred time set aside by God’s eternal 
law, a day of delight for worshipping God and sharing with others (Isa. 
58:13). We welcome the Sabbath with joy and gratitude.
“The Sabbath—oh!—make it the sweetest, the most blessed day of the 
whole week.”—FLB 36.
<p>“The Sabbath . . . is God’s time, not ours; when we trespass upon it we 
are stealing from God. . . . God has given us the whole of six days in which 
to do our work, and has reserved only one to Himself. This should be a day 
of blessing to us—a day when we should lay aside all our secular matters and 
center our thoughts upon God and heaven. . . .
“We are not to teach our children that they must not be happy on the 
Sabbath, that it is wrong to walk out of doors. Oh, no. Christ led His disciples 
out by the lakeside on the Sabbath day and taught them. His sermons on the 
Sabbath were not always preached within enclosed walls.”—HP 152. 
“God’s love has set a limit to the demands of toil. Over the Sabbath He 
places His merciful hand. In His own day He preserves for the family 
opportunity for communion with Him, with nature, and with one another.”—
Ed 251.
<p>The Sabbath hours belong to God and are to be used for Him alone. 
Honor God by “not going your own way and not doing as you please or 
speaking idle words” on the Sabbath day (Isa. 58:13 NIV). Let us gather in 
the family circle at sunset and welcome the Sabbath with prayer and song, 
and let us close the day with prayer and expressions of gratitude for His 
wondrous love. The Sabbath is a special day for worship in our homes and 
churches, a day of joy to ourselves and our children, a day in which we can 
learn more of God through the Bible and the great lesson book of nature. It is 
a time we can visit the sick and work for the salvation of souls. We should 
lay aside the ordinary affairs of the six working days and perform no 
unnecessary work. We should not let secular media occupy our time on God’s 
holy day.
“The Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless inactivity. The law 
forbids secular labor on the rest day of the Lord; the toil that gains a livelihood 
must cease; no labor for worldly pleasure or profit is lawful upon that day; 
but as God ceased His labor of creating, and rested upon the Sabbath and 
blessed it, so man is to leave the occupations of his daily life, and devote 
those sacred hours to healthful rest, to worship, and to holy deeds.”—DA 
207.
<p>A program of activities in harmony with the spirit of true Sabbathkeeping 
will make this blessed day the happiest and best of all the week for ourselves 
and for our children—a veritable foretaste of our heavenly rest.

                <h2>Reverence in the Place of Worship</h2>
                <p>Christians who appreciate God’s omnipotence, His holiness, and His 
love will always manifest a spirit of deep reverence for God, His Word, and 
His worship. “Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment of 
all who come into the presence of God.”—PP 252. We will recognize that 
“the hour and place of prayer are sacred, because God is there.”— GW 178. 
We will come to the house of worship, not carelessly, but in the spirit of 
meditation and prayer, and will avoid unnecessary conversation.
<p>As parents we should reverently instruct our children how they should 
behave in “the house of God” (1 Tim. 3:15). Faithful instruction and 
discipline of youth at home, Sabbath School, and church regarding reverence 
for God and His worship will go far in holding their loyalty in afteryears.
Pastors who sense the sacredness of God’s service will, by example, 
instruction, and conduct in the pulpit, foster reverence, simplicity, good 
order, and decorum in the church

                <h2>Health and Temperance</h2>
                <p>Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19). “Both mental 
and spiritual vigor are in great degree dependent upon physical strength and 
activity; whatever promotes physical health promotes the development of a 
strong mind and a well-balanced character.”—Ed 195.
            
<p>For this reason, we live intelligently in accordance with health principles 
of physical exercise, respiration, sunshine, pure air, use of water, sleep, and 
rest. By conviction we choose to eat healthfully, wear suitable clothing, 
practice cleanliness, engage in proper recreation, and freely choose to follow 
the principles of health, self-control, and wholesome diet. Therefore we 
abstain from all forms of alcohol, tobacco, and addictive drugs. We strive to 
preserve our physical and psychological balance by avoiding any excess.
            
<p>Health reform and the teaching of health and temperance are inseparable 
parts of the Church’s message. Instruction came to us through the Lord’s 
messenger “that those who are keeping His commandments must be brought 
into sacred relationship to Himself, and that by temperance in eating and 
drinking they must keep mind and body in the most favorable condition for 
service.”—CH 132. Also, “it is the Lord’s design that the restoring influence 
of health reform shall be a part of the last great effort to proclaim the gospel 
message.”—MM 259.
            
<p>We belong to God, body, soul, and spirit. It is therefore our religious 
duty to observe the laws of health, both for our own well-being and happiness 
and for more efficient service to God and society. We must keep our appetites 
under control. God has furnished us with a liberal variety of foods sufficient 
to satisfy every dietary need. “Fruits, grains, and vegetables, prepared in a 
simple way, . . . make, with milk or cream, the most healthful diet.”—CD 92.
            
<p>When we practice the principles of healthful living, we will not feel the 
need for stimulants. Nature’s law forbids our use of intoxicants and narcotics 
of any kind. From the early days of this movement abstinence from the use 
of liquor and tobacco has been a condition of membership. (See pp. 50, 52, 
67-68, 100, 175-176.)
            
<p>God has given us great light on the principles of health, and modern 
scientific research has abundantly verified these principles.

                <h2>Dress</h2>
                <p>As Seventh-day Adventist Christians we have been called out from the
world. Our religion must have a molding influence on all our activities. Our 
habits must stem from principle and not from the example of the world. 
<p>Customs and fashions may change, but principles of right conduct remain the 
same. Early in our history Ellen G. White wrote that the purpose of Christian 
dress is “to protect the people of God from the corrupting influence of the 
world, as well as to promote physical and moral health.”—4T 634. She also 
counsels that we should avoid gaudy display and profuse ornamentation, fads 
and extreme fashions, particularly those transgressing the laws of modesty, 
and that our clothing should be, when possible, “of good quality, of becoming 
colors, and suited for service” “rather than display.” Our attire should be 
characterized by modesty, “beauty,” “grace,” and “appropriateness of natural 
simplicity.”—MYP 351, 352.
            
<p>The people of God should always be found among the conservatives in 
dress, and will not let “the dress question fill the mind.”—Ev 273.
“To dress plainly, abstaining from display of jewelry and ornaments of 
every kind, is in keeping with our faith.”—3T 366. It is clearly taught in the 
Scriptures that the wearing of jewelry is contrary to the will of God. The 
apostle Paul admonishes us to dress ourselves “in modest apparel, with 
propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly 
clothing” (1 Tim. 2:9). The wearing of ornaments of jewelry is a bid for 
attention not in keeping with Christian self-forgetfulness.
            
<p>In some countries and cultures the custom of wearing the wedding ring 
is considered imperative, having become, in the minds of the people, a 
criterion of virtue, and hence it is not regarded as an ornament. Under such 
circumstances we do not condemn the practice.
            
<p>Let us remember that it is not outward adornment that expresses true 
Christian character, but “the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible 
beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God” 
(1 Peter 3:3, 4). We should avoid the use of cosmetics not in keeping with 
good taste and the principles of Christian modesty.
            
<p>We should observe cleanliness and Christlike deportment as we seek at 
all times to please and rightly represent Christ our Lord. Christian parents by 
example, instruction, and authority should lead their sons and daughters to 
attire themselves modestly, and thus win the respect and confidence of those 
who know them. Let us consider ourselves well dressed only when we meet 
the demands of modesty by wearing tasteful, conservative clothing.

                <h2>Simplicity</h2>
                <p>Simplicity has been a fundamental feature of the Church from its 
beginning. We must continue to be a people called to live a simple life. 
Increase of pomp in religion always parallels a decline in spiritual power. As 
“the life of Jesus presented a marked contrast” to the display and ostentation 
of His time (Ed 77), so the simplicity and power of our message must be in 
marked contrast to the worldly display of our day. The Lord condemns 
“needless, extravagant expenditure of money to gratify pride and love of 
display.”—TM 179. In harmony with these principles, simplicity and 
economy should characterize our graduating exercises, our weddings, and all 
other church services.

                <h2>Modern Media</h2>
                <p>Like our bodies, our inner beings need wholesome nourishment for 
renewal and strengthening (2 Cor. 4:6). Our minds are the measure of our 
persons. Food for our minds is of the utmost importance in developing 
character and in carrying out our life’s purposes. For this reason we should 
carefully evaluate our mental habits. What we choose to read, hear, and 
watch, whether by book or magazine, radio or television, the Internet, or other 
modern media shapes and impacts our character.
<p>Books and other literature are among the most valuable means of 
education and culture, but these must be well chosen and rightly used. There 
is a wealth of good literature, but equally there is a flood of literature, often 
in most attractive guise, that damages minds and morals. The tales of wild 
adventure and of moral laxness, whether fact or fiction, however presented, 
are unfit for Christians of any age.
“Those who indulge the habit of racing through an exciting story are 
simply crippling their mental strength and disqualifying their minds for 
vigorous thought and research.”—CT 135. Along with other evil results from 
the habit of reading fiction, we are told that “it unfits the soul to contemplate 
the great problems of duty and destiny” and “creates a distaste for life’s 
practical duties.”—CT 383.
<p>Radio, television, and the Internet have changed the whole atmosphere 
of our modern world and have brought us within easy contact with the life, 
thought, and activities of the entire globe. They can be great educational 
agencies through which we can enlarge our knowledge of world events and 
enjoy important discussions and the best in music.
<p>Unfortunately, however, modern mass media also can bring to their 
audiences almost continuous theatrical and other performances with 
influences that are neither wholesome nor uplifting. If we are not 
discriminating, they will bring sordid programs right into our homes.
<p>Safety for ourselves and our children is found in a determination, by 
God’s help, to follow the admonition of the apostle Paul: “Finally . . . 
whatever things are true . . . noble . . . just . . . pure . . . lovely . . . of good 
report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate 
on these things” (Phil. 4:8).

                <h2>Recreation and Entertainment</h2>
                <p>Recreation is a purposeful refreshing of the powers of body and mind. A 
vigorous, wholesome mind will not require worldly amusement but will find 
a renewal of strength in good recreation.
“Many of the amusements popular in the world today, even with those 
who claim to be Christians, tend to the same end as did those of the heathen. 
There are indeed few among them that Satan does not turn to account in 
destroying souls. Through the drama he has worked for ages to excite passion 
and glorify vice. The opera, with its fascinating display and bewildering 
music, the masquerade, the dance, the card table, Satan employs to break 
down the barriers of principle and open the door to sensual indulgence. In 
every gathering for pleasure where pride is fostered or appetite indulged, 
where one is led to forget God and lose sight of eternal interests, there Satan 
is binding his chains about the soul.”—PP 459, 460. (See p. 175-176.)
<p>We must avoid anything that dramatizes, graphically presents, or 
suggests the sins and crimes of humanity—murder, adultery, robbery, and 
similar evils, which to a large degree are responsible for the breakdown of 
morality. Instead, we should find delight in God’s great world of nature and 
in the romance of human agencies and divine workings.
<p>Social dancing is another form of amusement with an evil influence. 
“The amusement of dancing . . . is a school of depravity, a fearful curse to 
society.”—MYP 399. (See 2 Cor. 6:15-18; 1 John 2:15-17; James 4:4; 2 Tim. 
2:19-22; Eph. 5:8-11; Col. 3:5-10.)
<p>Recreation is essential. But instead of joining the multitudes who are 
“lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God” (2 Tim. 3:4), we should 
endeavor to make our friendships and recreations both Christ-centered and 
church-centered.

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>“Music was made to serve a holy purpose, to lift the thoughts to that 
which is pure, noble, and elevating, and to awaken in the soul devotion and 
gratitude to God.”—PP 594. Jesus “held communion with heaven in song.”—
DA 73.
            
<p>Music is one of the highest arts. Good music not only gives us pleasure 
but elevates our minds and cultivates our finest qualities. God often has used 
spiritual songs to touch the hearts of sinners and lead to repentance. On the 
contrary, debased music breaks down morality and draws us away from our 
relationship with God.
            
<p>We should exercise great care in the choice of music in our homes, social 
gatherings, schools, and churches. Any melody partaking of the nature of 
jazz, rock, or related hybrid forms, or any language expressing foolish or 
trivial sentiments, will be shunned. (See pp. 101, 104-105, 155.)

speedily carrying the last offer of salvation to the world, and facing a 
judgment that will culminate in the establishment of universal righteousness, 
let us consecrate ourselves body, soul, and spirit to God, determining to 
maintain the high standards of living that must characterize those who wait 
for the return of their Lord.
