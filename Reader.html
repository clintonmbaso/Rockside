01. Genesis 1:1 - Genesis 2:7</strong><br>
THIS GREAT WORLD in which we live did not always exist. The broad expanse of sky, which smiles upon us when days are fair, and frowns and weeps when days are foul, did not always form an arch above our earth-home. Long, long ago there was no world at all. There was no sun to shine, there were no stars to twinkle, nor moonbeams to play through the night shadows. But even then there was God; for he ever has been and always shall be the same unchanging Divine Being.<br>
                           <br>
Then, away back in that long ago, at the very beginning of time, God made the world. Not as we see it today, for at first water covered everything, and all was darkness everywhere. What a strange, unfriendly world this must have been, for no living creature could dwell in it! But God planned to make it beautiful, so he caused the light to shine. This light he called Day and the darkness he called Night. And then the evening and morning of the first day of time passed by,<br>
                           <br>
On the second day God made the beautiful blue sky, and placed above the water-covered earth clouds to carry the sky-moisture. He called the sky Heaven. On the third day he caused the waters to flow together in wide, deep places, and he called them Seas. Dry land then rose up, and this he called Earth. But as yet there were no grasses, flowers, nor trees-the whole earth was barren and desolate. So God caused a carpet of grass to grow upon the bare ground and beautiful flowers to spring up from the earth. The trees and herbs also he made to grow at his will. When God beheld all these things he saw that they were good.<br>
                           <br>
On the fourth day appeared the great lights which we see in the sky-the sun, the moon, and the stars. These he made to divide the day from the night.<br>
                           <br>
After these things were made, God began to create living creatures. He made fishes of all kinds and sizes to swim about in the seas and birds of every description to fly about above the water and land, just as we see them doing today. Thus the world continued to become more delightful, and the fifth day of the first week of time passed by.<br>
                           <br>
On the sixth day God made all the animals, great and small, and every creeping thing. Then there was life abounding in the woods and on the plains, as well as in the air and in the sea. What a beautiful world! Still what a strange world, for there were no people in it! Not a home anywhere-not a man, woman, nor little child to be seen. What a very strange world indeed!<br>
                           <br>
But God had not yet finished his work of creation, for he wished to have people live in the wonderful world he had made. They could enjoy its beauties and take care of it as no other living creature could do. And more, they could know who had made all these great things, and knowing God they could love and worship him. So it was that God made the first man. Out of the dust of the ground he made the man's body, then he breathed into that body with the breath of life and man became a living soul.<br>
                           <br>
This first man God called Adam, and to Adam he gave the power to rule over all the other living creatures. These animals and birds he brought to Adam, and Adam gave each of them a name. But not one of them did Adam find suitable for a helper, and because he needed a helper very much God made for him a woman. This woman became Adam's wife, and he loved her very much. He called her name Eve.<br>
                           <br>
When the sixth day ended God had made the world and had placed everything in it just as he wished, therefore on the seventh day he rested from his work.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>02. Genesis 2:8 - Genesis 3:24</strong><br>
GOD HIMSELF MADE for Adam and Eve their first earth-home. And a beautiful home it was. We shall call it a garden-home. God chose a place from which four rivers flowed and there he planted a large garden. We do not know the many kinds of trees and flowers and vegetables and grasses that he caused to grow in this garden. But we are sure that no park which man has made could be so lovely as was the Garden of Eden. In the midst of this garden God planted a wonderful tree, called the tree of, life. Whoever might eat of the fruit of this tree would live on and on forever.<br>
                           <br>
Adam and Eve were very happy. God had given them good things to enjoy, and they knew nothing about evil and wrong-doing. They often talked with God and listened to his voice as he walked and talked with them in the cool of evening time.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God wanted Adam and Eve to prove their love for him, and for this reason he planted in the beautiful garden one test-tree, called the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &quot;Of the fruit of every other tree in this garden you may eat,&quot; God had told them &quot;but the fruit of this test- tree you must not taste. If you do, you shall surely die.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not know how long Adam and Eve enjoyed their beautiful garden-home, but we do know that one day a sad thing happened. Sin crept slyly into this lovely place. It came first to Eve. She heard a voice and saw a serpent talking to her. She was not afraid, because she had never known fear. So she listened. &quot;Has God said that you must not eat the fruit of every tree in this garden?&quot; the serpent asked.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We may eat of every tree except one,&quot; Eve answered. &quot;God has told us that we must not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, lest we die.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That is a mistake; you will not surely die,&quot; the serpent replied. &quot;God knows that if you eat fruit from this tree you will become wise to know good and evil, as he is wise, therefore he has forbidden you to eat of it.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until this time Eve had not touched the forbidden tree, but now she looked at its fruit and thought that if it really would make her wise, like God, she wanted to taste it. Soon she yielded to the temptation and plucked the fruit, and then she gave some to Adam, and he too ate of it.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At once Adam and Eve knew what a dreadful thing sin is. They knew they had disobeyed God. A strange something stole into their hearts; it was fear. How afraid they were to meet God! They had never been afraid before, but now they tried to find a hiding-place among the beautiful trees in the garden. Their hearts had become wicked.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon a voice called, &quot;Adam, where are you?&quot; and the frightened man answered, &quot;Lord, I heard your voice and I was afraid, therefore I hid myself.&quot; &quot;Why should you be afraid to meet me?&quot; God asked &quot;Have you eaten of the forbidden fruit?&quot; Then Adam told God that Eve had given him some of the fruit and he had eaten it.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What is this you have done?&quot; God questioned Eve. And she told him what the serpent had said. &quot;I listened to the tempter and then ate of the fruit and gave it to my husband,&quot; was her sorrowful confession.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God was grieved because Adam and Eve had failed to obey him. Now he knew they could no longer enjoy his presence with them, because sin had spoiled their lives. They were no longer fit to live in the beautiful garden home he had made for them. So he sent them away out into the world to make a home for themselves. And he placed an angel at the gate of the garden to prevent them from coming back to eat of the fruit that grew on the wonderful tree of life.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Eve, God said, &quot;Because you listened to the tempter's voice and disobeyed me, you shall have pain and trouble all the days of your life.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam also received a sentence of punishment from God. No longer should the ground yield freely of the fruits and vegetables which Adam and Eve ate for food; now Adam must work hard to keep these things growing. And he would find that weeds and thorns arid thistles would grow in his fields to make his work even harder. Then by and by he should grow old and feeble, and then he should die and his body would again become dust as it was before God created him. All these sorrows came because of sin.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while God drove Adam and Eve out of the beautiful garden, he at the same time gave them the promise that he would send a Savior to make all men free from sin and death.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>03. Genesis 4</strong><br>
AFTER SIN CAUSED God to shut Adam and Eve out of the beautiful home that he had made for them, they built a home for themselves somewhere outside the garden gate. Here they began to feel more and more the punishment which their sin had brought upon them. Adam had to toil hard and long to secure food for himself and for Eve. No doubt his hands and feet were sometimes bruised and torn by thistles and thorns. Eve too learned the sad meaning of pain and sorrow. Her home was not so happy as it had been before she listened to the tempter's voice, and chose to disobey God.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
But all the while God loved Adam and Eve. We can not know how great was his grief when they sinned. No longer could he walk and talk with them as he had done before. Now sin, like a great, black monster, had stepped in and spoiled their friendship, and where sin dwells God will not go. No doubt Adam and Eve were sorry, too. No longer could they have God's presence in their home because sin had fastened itself in their hearts.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But because God loved them still, he gave Adam and Eve a promise of a Savior. And because they believed the promise, hope came into their hearts again. Although they could not talk to God as they had done in their garden-home, now they confessed their sins to him, and it appears certain that they brought gifts which they offered upon altars. These altars they built by piling up either stones or earth, making a flat top, and placing on the top some wood, all cut and ready to be burned. Next they laid their offering upon the wood, then set fire to the wood, and that burned up the offering.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are sure that Adam and Eve must have felt lonely, with no friends in all the big, wide world. But God planned that there should be more people, and so one day he gave Adam and Eve a little child-a baby boy. This baby they named Cain. How they must have loved him! After a while God gave them another little boy, and they named him Abel.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Cain and his little brother Abel grew old enough to understand, Adam and Eve told them about the great God, and how they themselves had disobeyed him before Cain and Abel were born. They wanted their sons to love this God and try to please him. But alas! sin, like a tiny seed, was already buried in the hearts of these little boys, causing them to think naughty thoughts, or say unkind words, or do wrong deeds, just as little boys and girls are tempted to do today. Abel wanted to please God and he was sorry because he sinned; but Cain allowed the tiny sin-seed to grow and grow until his heart became very wicked.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By and by Cain and Abel became men, like Adam, and Cain worked in the fields raising grain and fruits, while Abel took care of a flock of sheep. These brothers built altars, upon which they offered their gifts to God, as their parents did. Cain brought for his offering fruit from the field where he had labored, and Abel brought a fat lamb. But Cain's offering did not please God. When he saw that God was displeased, he became very angry. God talked to him. He warned him of the harm that might come if he should continue to be angry instead of becoming sorry for his sins. But Cain was not willing to listen; he was not sorry for his sins.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abel believed the promise which God had given to his parents, and when he offered his gift he prayed and asked God to forgive his sins. God was pleased with Abel's offering.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day while the brothers were together in the field, Cain quarreled with Abel. Now, we are sure that nothing good can come of quarrels, because they are so wrong. This quarrel ended dreadfully. Cain grew so angry with Abel that he killed him. What an awful deed!<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God spoke again to Cain, and asked, &quot;Where is Abel, your brother?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cain replied, &quot;I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wicked Cain did not know that God had seen all he did. And now for a punishment God told Cain that he must leave his old home forever.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now at last Cain felt sorry, but he was sorry only because he was to be punished for his sin. He thought God was punishing him more than he could bear. Then God placed a mark upon him that all could see, and by that mark they would know that God did not want them to kill Cain.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this Cain wandered far away into a land called Nod. There he lived for many long years.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam and Eve lived a long time, and God gave them other children besides Cain and Abel. Then the time came at last when their bodies grew feeble with age and they died, as God had said they should when they ate the forbidden fruit.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>04. Genesis 5:1 - Genesis 9:17</strong><br>
HE CHILDREN OF Adam and Eve lived to be very old. Their children also lived for several hundreds of years. And so it was that grandsons became grandfathers before their own grandfathers died. Thus several generations lived and worked together. After a while there were many people living in the world.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not know very much about those people of long ago except the fact that many of them were very wicked. Among them was one man, however, who, like Abel, tried to please God. This man's name was Enoch. The Bible tells us that Enoch walked with God. We understand that he loved God better than he loved anything else, and talked to God and listened when God talked to him. Finally Enoch became an old man. At last, when he was three hundred and sixty-five years old, one day God took him away from earth to heaven, and he did not die. Enoch had a son whom he named Methuselah. This man lived for nine hundred and sixty-nine years, until he was older than any other man had ever been. Then he died, like all other people had done except his father Enoch.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time there were many, many people living in the world. And their hearts were so full of sin that their thoughts and words and deeds were all very wicked. They did not try to please God at all. They did not love him. They did not thank him for the blessings of food and shelter and sunshine which he gave to them. They did not teach their children to love good, pure things, but allowed them to grow up and become evil men and women like themselves. What a sad world this was! for sin was everywhere.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally God planned to destroy all the people because they were no longer fit to live. He felt sorry that he ever had made man. He thought he would destroy everything-people, animals, and every other creature that lived on the earth. He would cause a great flood of water to cover the earth.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then God remembered Noah. Here was a man who had tried to do right regardless of all his wicked surroundings. And he had taught his sons to do right also. God was pleased with Noah and with his sons. Sometimes he talked to Noah. Now he told him about his plan to destroy the world. But because Noah and his family had been trying to do right and trust in the Lord, God promised that they should not be destroyed with the wicked people.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Get ready to build an ark,&quot; God told Noah, &quot;and then when it is finished you and your wife, your sons and their wives may go into this ark and live there until the flood is ended.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that God decided to save a few people he also arranged to save a pair of each kind of animal and of bird and of every living thing on the earth that breathed. These creatures were to be housed in the ark, too, while the flood should last.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noah believed God and made ready to build the ark. God had told him how it should be built. For a long time, while others went their wicked way, he and his sons worked, sawing boards and hammering nails, and making every part of the ark just exactly as God had said it should be made. Then by and by every nail was driven securely into its place, the inside walls were finished, and every part was ready for the purpose it should serve. What a queer-looking building now stood before them-a very large boat-like house three stories high, away out on dry land! Doubtless the people laughed much at faithful old Noah and his three sons. Perhaps they thought that only feeble-minded folk could believe that there ever would be such a thing as a flood. Still Noah continued to warn them that they should repent of their sins lest God destroy them.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, when the ark was completed and everything else was in readiness, God called Noah and told him to bring his wife, his three sons and their wives, and come into the ark. And the animals and birds and creeping things God caused to come also, two and two of every kind; and of those animals which man should need after the flood, and birds, seven pairs of each kind came. When they were all inside the ark God himself shut the door.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few days the rain began to fall. And such a rain! Great sheets of water poured down from the clouds as if windows in the sky had been opened and water was flowing through them. Soon the tiny streamlets were raging torrents and the rivers were overflowing their banks. People began to forsake their homes and rush to the hills for safety. Animals, too, ran pell-mell everywhere, trying to find a place of refuge and shelter from the storm. But still it rained, and higher and higher the waters rose until every one believed at last that Noah had told the truth. But now it was too late to repent and seek refuge in the ark, for God had shut the door. And so when the waters crept up to the tops of the hills and mountains and finally buried them out of sight, every living creature on the face of the earth was drowned. Those in the ark were the only ones left alive.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For forty days and nights the downpour of rain continued; but Noah and his family were safe. When the waters rose high enough they lifted the ark off the ground, and it began to float about like a great ship on the top of the flood. For six months and more it floated high above the water-covered earth. Then one day it came to a standstill. God had caused a wind to blow over the waters to dry them up, and as the flood-tide became gradually lower, the ark had found a lodging-place on the top of a mountain. Here it rested for two months, and all the while the water-mark continued to drop lower down the mountainsides.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for some time, Noah opened a window, which must have been very high up, near the roof. He allowed a bird called a raven to fly out of the window. Now, the raven has strong wings, and this bird flew to and fro until the waters had gone down. After some days, Noah sent out a dove; but this bird could not find a place to build her nest, so she soon returned again to the ark. Another week of waiting passed, and Noah sent the dove out once more. She stayed longer this time; and when evening came she flew back to Noah, bringing a green olive-leaf in her mouth. At this Noah and his family knew that the waters were returning to the rivers and the seas, and that the land again was becoming green and beautiful. One more week they waited, and now when Noah sent out the dove she flew away and never returned.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Noah believed that the time had come when he might uncover the roof and look out upon the earth. How glad he must have been to see dry land again; for more than a year had passed since God had shut them inside the ark. And God said to him, &quot;Come out of the ark, with your wife and your sons and their wives, and every living thing that is with you in the ark.&quot; So Noah opened the great door, and he and his family stepped out upon the dry ground. All the animals and the birds and the creeping things came out also, and began to live upon the earth as they had done before the flood.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noah was thankful to God because his life and the lives of his family had been saved when all other people had perished from off the earth. He built an altar as soon as he came out of the ark, and brought his offering to God. Because Noah had been obedient, God accepted his offering and was pleased with his household.<br>
                           <br>
God then promised that never again would he send another flood to destroy every living creature, and that as long as the earth should remain there would be summer and winter, springtime and autumn, and day and night. And because God wanted mankind to remember always the promise that he would never again destroy the earth with a flood, he placed in the sky a sign of his promise. That sign was a beautiful rainbow. Have you ever seen that rainbow-sign? It is God's promise to all mankind-to you and to me as well as to Noah and his children.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>05. Genesis 9:18 - Genesis 11:9</strong><br>
A CLEAN, NEW world lay before Noah and his three sons when they stepped out of the ark. Now there were no wicked neighbors to mock at them when they built altars to worship God. Even the wicked works of those wicked people had been swept away out of sight. Everything was ready for a new beginning.<br>
                           <br>
Noah and his sons set to work and made new homes. Noah's sons were named Shem, Ham, and Japheth. After a while God gave them children. These children grew up and made homes for themselves. Then there were other children; and so it came about that the number of people grew and grew until the earth became as full of people as it was before the flood.<br>
                           <br>
From the mountain of Ararat, where the ark lodged when the waters went down, the human family went into the south country. Later they moved east, into the valley of Mesopotamia, and there they lived on a plain in the land of Shinar.<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Let us build for ourselves a city,&quot; said the people some time after they reached Shinar, &quot;and let us make a tower so great and high that its top will reach up to the sky. Then we shall not be scattered over the face of the earth, and separated from one another.&quot; And so the people set to work.<br>
                           <br>
In this land of Shinar the soil is such that bricks can be made of it, and soon many bricks were made and ready for use. What a busy people! Some were making brick, others were mixing mortar, and still others were carrying brick and mortar to the workmen who were building the city and the tower. Everything was moving fast and everybody was thinking that some day their city and their wonderful tower would be finished.<br>
                           <br>
Then something happened that the people had not expected to happen at all. God came to see the city and the tower. He did not talk to the builders, and very likely they did not know he had been there to look upon their work. But God was not pleased with what he saw. He knew that men would become more sinful if they should finish that great tower. Already they were thinking more and more about their own work and less and less about the God who gave them strength with which to labor. Soon they might forget God entirely and worship the work their own hands had made. So God planned to stop their building.<br>
                           <br>
Until this time all the people in the world spoke one language. Now God caused them to speak different languages. The people of one family could not understand what their neighbors were talking about. Neither could their neighbors understand what they were saying. Such a great change caused the people to become restless, and all those who spoke one language moved into neighbor-hoods by themselves. They could no longer go on with their great building, either, because the workmen could not understand one another's language; and so at last they quit trying to finish the tower whose top they had planned should reach the sky. And the name of the city was called Babel.<br>
                           <br>
Soon the people of one language gathered together their possessions and moved away from Babel. Others did the same. Across the plains they journeyed and over the mountains into strange lands where men's feet had never walked before. They built cities and planted fields and vineyards, and their number grew until they became strong nations.<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><br>
06. Genesis 11:27 - Genesis 12:20</strong><br>
THE PEOPLE WHO moved away from Babel into different parts of the world did not pray to God. Their hearts were sinful, and they shrank away from the purity of God, as Adam and Eve did when they tried to hide from God's presence in the Garden of Eden. But we find that the people prayed to something. In every country where they went they had some kind of worship. Many of them worshiped things that God had made, such as the sun, the moon, and the stars. Afterward they also worshiped rivers and mountains and hills. They made images of wood and of stone to these things which they worshiped, and called the images gods.<br>
                           <br>
Not far from the city of Babel, where the tower was left unfinished, another city was built. This city was called Ur of the Chaldees, because it was built in the home country of the Chaldean people. These people worshiped the moon-god, Ur, and when they built their great city they named it in honor of their god.<br>
                           <br>
On the plains near Ur lived an old man who was a shepherd. He tilled the soil and also raised large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle. His name was Terah. He had three grown sons named Abram, Nahor, and Haran. They were also shepherd-farmers. Haran did not live to be very old. When he died he left a son named Lot.<br>
                           <br>
Now, Abram the son of Terah was a good man. He did not worship the moon-god as did his neighbors. He believed in the true God. He built altars and worshiped God just as Abel and Noah had done long years before. His offerings pleased God, and his prayers were heard.<br>
                           <br>
One day Abraham heard the voice of God calling to him. He listened. God told him to gather together his family and his flocks and herds, bid farewell to his neighbors and friends, and start out on a long journey. God promised to lead him to a land far away, where he would bless him and make his name great. Through his family God promised to give a blessing to all families in the world.<br>
                           <br>
Perhaps Abram did not understand the meaning of all God's promise. He did not know that in the years to come a Savior should be born among the people of his own family, who would then be called the Jews. This Savior, we know, is the blessing which God promised to give to all families in the world, if Abram would obey his voice.<br>
                           <br>
Although Abram did not know these things, nor even the country to which God wished to lead him, he was not afraid to go. So he took all his family-his wife, whose name was Sarai, his aged father, Terah, his brother Nahor and his wife, and the young son of his dead brother Haran. They and their servants Abram urged to start out with him on his journey. And they took all their possessions too-the tents in which they lived, and the large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.<br>
                           <br>
Day after day they journeyed up the great River Euphrates until they came to a place called Haran. Here they stopped to rest, and here Abram's aged father died and was buried. Even before that God spoke to Abram and urged him to continue his journey. But Nahor, Abram's brother, was unwilling to go farther, so he remained at Haran and made his home at that place.<br>
                           <br>
After this Abram made a second start. Now he took only his wife, Sarai, his nephew Lot, and their servants. Driving their flocks and herds before them, they turned away from the great river and journeyed southwest, toward the land of Canaan. On one side of them the mountains rose wild and high, while on the other side, as far as they could see, the barren desert stretched away toward the south. On and on they traveled-across rivers, through valleys, over hills-each day farther from their homeland and nearer to the land which God had promised. We do not know how many days and weeks and months passed by before they came to the plain of Moreh, where God spoke again to Abram. &quot;This is the land,&quot; God told him, &quot;that I will give to you and to your children.&quot; And Abram built an altar there and worshiped God.<br>
                           <br>
Now, this land of promise was called Canaan, because the Canaanite people lived in it. These people had been there for a long time and had built some towns and cities. Abram did not live among the Canaanite people, but pitched his tents out on the hills or plains, wherever. he could find grass for his cattle and sheep to eat and water for them to drink. All the while his flocks and herds grew larger, until finally Abram became very rich.<br>
                           <br>
Then there came a famine in the land. The grass failed and the waters of the brooks dried up. Nowhere could Abram find pasture, go he moved away from Canaan into the country called Egypt. Here he saw the great River Nile, and possibly even the pyramids and the sphinx. But he did not remain long in Egypt, because God did not want him to dwell there. When the famine ended in Canaan, he returned again to that country.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>07. Genesis 13</strong><br>
AFTER ABRAM RETURNED from Egypt, he and Lot journeyed to the place where they had first pitched their tents in Canaan. There Abram had built an altar to worship God. At the very same place he now sacrificed another offering, and again talked to God.<br>
                           <br>
Abram was now a very rich man. Not only did he possess many servants, flocks, and herds, but he also possessed much silver and gold. And we find that his nephew Lot owned many servants and sheep and cattle too.<br>
                           <br>
Wherever these men and their servants pitched their tents, the place looked like a tent-town. And the country all around them would be dotted with cattle and sheep.<br>
                           <br>
After some time trouble arose between the servants of Abram and Lot. Some of Abram's servants were caretakers of his cattle and sheep. They and the servants who cared for Lot's flocks quarreled. Abram's servants wanted the best pasture-land for Abram's flocks, and Lot's servants wanted that same land for their master's flocks. And so the trouble grew. By and by news of the quarrel reached the ears of Abram.<br>
                           <br>
He looked out over the crowded country and saw how hard it must be for the servants. How could they always find Places near by where tender grasses grew and where water was plentiful' He saw, too, the villages of the Canaanites not far away, and he knew there was not room enough in that part of the country for all to dwell together peaceably.<br>
                           <br>
So Abram called Lot and said, &quot;Let there be no quarrel between us or between our servants. There is not room enough for both of us to dwell together with our flocks and herds. But see, the whole land lies before us. Let us separate. If you choose to go to the west country, then I shall journey east; but if you desire the east country, then I shall go west.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
From the height upon which Abram and Lot stood to view the country they could see far to the east and to the west. Because Abram was the one to whom God had promised all this land he could have chosen the better part, or he could have sent Lot and his servants away out of the land altogether. But Abram was not selfish.<br>
                           <br>
He kindly offered Lot the first choice. And Lot, forgetting the kindness of his uncle, thought only of his own interests and chose the east country, through which the Jordan River flowed.<br>
                           <br>
&quot;I can always find plenty of grass and water there,&quot; he reasoned, &quot;and my flocks and herds will grow in number until soon I shall become very rich, too.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
After Lot departed with his possessions, God spoke again to Abram. Perhaps God saw that Abram felt lonely. So he comforted him by reminding him of the promise that the whole of Canaan's land should belong to him and to his children.<br>
                           <br>
As yet Abram and Sarai had no children, but God said that some day the children of their grandsons and great-grandsons should be many. And Abram believed God. God also told Abram to journey through the length and breadth of Canaan's land to see how large a country it was.<br>
                           <br>
So Abram moved away from the place where he and Lot had lived together for the last time, and came to a plain called Mamre. Here he pitched his tents under the oak-trees near the city of Hebron, and then built another altar to worship God.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>08. Genesis 14</strong><br>
WHEN LOT SELECTED the fertile plains of Jordan for his share of Canaan's land, he thought he was making a wise choice. He saw in the distance the large cities of the plain, called Sodom and Gomorrah. He knew that in those cities he could sell sheep and cattle from his flocks and herds, and soon have much silver and gold. So he moved toward Sodom. After a while he pitched his tents still nearer the city walls, and finally he moved his family inside the gate.<br>
                           <br>
Now, Sodom was not a nice place for good people to live. The people of Sodom cared nothing about God. Some of them were very rich, and perhaps they had beautiful homes. But they had unlovely hearts.The Bible tells us that the men of Sodom were wicked and great sinners in God's sight. But in Lot's sight they were rich men, and clever, and so he brought his family to dwell among them. This was a sad mistake.<br>
                           <br>
One day trouble came upon Sodom. There had been war in the land and the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, and three other cities had gone out to battle. The army against which they fought defeated them. Then the conquering soldiers entered the gates of Sodom and of Gomorrah, crowded through the streets, and pushed their way into rich men's houses, taking everything that they could find to carry away. They even took people and led them away to become slaves. And Lot with his wife and children were taken with the others.<br>
                           <br>
One of the captured men escaped and fled across the country to the place near Hebron where Abram lived. He told about the battle and what had happened to Lot. When Abram heard of Lot's trouble, he took three hundred and eighteen of his men servants and, with some friends, hurried in pursuit of the captives. After a long, hard march across the country they came upon the enemy's camp at a place in the north of Canaan, called Dan. It was night, and the unsuspecting enemies lay asleep. Abram and his men rushed upon them and frightened them. They thought a great army had come to fight against them, and they were not prepared for a battle. So they rose up in haste and ran away, leaving behind their tents and all the goods and the people which they had taken away from Sodom and Gomorrah.<br>
                           <br>
This was a great victory for Abram. The people of Canaan honored him for his courage, and the king of Sodom went out to meet him. He offered Abram all the gold and silver and food and clothing that he had taken away from the enemy's camp, and asked only that the people be returned again to Sodom. But Abram would not accept any reward from the king, because he had promised God that he would not keep anything for himself. And so all the people and their possessions were again returned to their homes.<br>
                           <br>
Another king also came out to meet Abram. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of Salem, a place which was later called Jerusalem. Melchizedek was different from the other people of Canaan because he loved the true God and worshiped him. He was a priest of God. When this king met Abram he brought food for him, and then he asked God to bless Abram. He also thanked God for giving Abram such a great victory.<br>
                           <br>
Because Melchizedek was a priest of the true God, Abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken from the enemy's camp.<br>
                           <br>
After this experience, Lot took his wife and children and went back again to live in wicked Sodom; but Abram returned to his quiet tent-home under the oak-trees near Hebron.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><br>
09. Genesis 15 - Genesis 17</strong><br>
ABRAM WAS NOW growing old. Although he had great riches and many servants, yet he had no children. One night while he lay asleep in his tent-home, God appeared to him in a vision. &quot;Do not be afraid,&quot; God told him, &quot;for I will protect you, and will give you a great reward because you are faithful.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&quot;What will you give me for a reward ?&quot; Abram asked. And God answered that some day Abram should have a son. Then, at God's bidding, Abram rose up and went outside his tent door and looked up at the starlit heavens. &quot;The children of your family,&quot; God told Abram, &quot;shall some day be as many as the stars-so many that no one can count them.&quot; Abram understood by this that God was speaking of the people who should some day possess Canaan's land, for they should be Abram's descendants. And he believed in the Lord, although he could not see even the beginning of that great family of promise.<br>
                           <br>
God also caused Abram to understand that there would be a time when the children of his family should become slaves in a strange land, and should dwell there for four hundred years. After that they should again return to Canaan, and possess the land for their own. We shall see in later stories how this came to pass.<br>
                           <br>
We remember that at one time Abram and his household journeyed into Egypt, during a famine in the land of Canaan. When they returned to Canaan they brought with them an Egyptian servant-girl named Hagar. They taught Hagar to know about the true God and to listen if he should speak to her. And they expected her to work faith-fully for them, a.s good servants should.<br>
                           <br>
One day Hagar did not please her mistress, Sarai. This was wrong, and Sarai punished her severely. Hagar became very unhappy, until finally she decided to run away.<br>
                           <br>
Now, running away is never an easy thing to do, and as Hagar hastened along the sandy, desert road she grew very tired. So she stopped to rest by a fountain of water along the roadside. In this lonely place, in the deep wilderness, some one found her. It was an angel of the Lord.<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Hagar, Sarai's maid, where did you come from? and where are you going?&quot; the angel inquired.<br>
                           <br>
&quot;I am fleeing from my mistress,&quot; Hagar replied, &quot;because I am unhappy.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Return again,&quot; the angel said, &quot;and try to please Sarai. After a while God will give you a little son. He shall grow up to be a strong man, and he shall be called Ishmael.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Hagar knew it was a messenger from God who spoke to her. And she knew now that she could never run away from God, because he had seen her all the while. So she obeyed the angel's word and returned again to her mistress. Afterward that fountain of water in the wilderness where the angel found her was called Beerlahairoi, a word w means, &quot;A well of the Living One who sees me.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
So after Hagar returned to Sarai's tent-home, God gave her the child he had promised. Abram named him Ishmael, which means, &quot;God hears.&quot; And Hagar remembered that this was the name by which the angel had said the child should be called. Abram loved Ishmael; but Ishmael was not the child that God had promised to give to him. We shall learn more about Hagar and Ishmael by and by.<br>
                           <br>
The years passed on until Abram was nearly one hundred years old. Then God spoke to him again. Abram fell on his face and listened. God said, &quot;I will make a covenant with you.&quot; Now, a covenant is a promise between two persons, each one agreeing to do something for the other. In this covenant God promised to give Abram a son and Abram promised to serve God faithfully. Then God said, &quot;Your name shall no more be called Abram, but Abraham, which means, 'The father of many,' and your wife, Sarai, shall be called 'Sarah,' which means, 'Princess.'&quot;<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><br>
10. Genesis 18</strong><br>
IT WAS NOONDAY, and everywhere the sun shone hot upon the plains. But Abraham sat in the cool shade of his tent door, beneath a tree. Presently three strange men drew near. They did not look like other men, and Abraham knew they were from a far country. He hurried to meet them, and, bowing low toward the ground just as he always when greeting a friend or a visitor, he urged them to rest for a while in the cool shade. This they were quite ready to do.<br>
                           <br>
Now we shall see how Abraham entertained his guests. First he merit for water to wash their feet. This was not unusual because people wore sandals in that long-ago time and it was customary for them to remove their sandals and wash their feet whenever they sat down to rest and visit. Next, Abraham told his wife to make ready and bake some barley cakes upon the hearth, while he should prepare some meat, for his guests. Then he ran out to his herd and selected a young calf, which he gave to a servant to dress and cook. When all was ready, he brought the food to his guests, and they ate while he stood under a tree near by. Abraham was glad to serve these strangers because he was kind to every one.<br>
                           <br>
When the meal was ended, the men arose to continue their journey. Abraham walked with them for a little way. By this time he knew they were not like other men, but they were heavenly beings. Two of them were angels. The other one was the Lord. And Abraham felt that he was unworthy to entertain such wonderful visitors. But because he was a good man the Lord loved him.<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Shall I hide from Abraham this thing which I do&quot;? the Lord asked his companions. &quot;I know that he will teach his children to keep my ways and to do right.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Then, turning toward Abraham the Lord said, &quot;I am going to visit Sodom and Gomorrah to see if these cities are as wicked as they seem, for the cry of their sins has reached me.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
The two men hurried on; but Abraham detained the Lord a while longer, because he wanted to talk to him. He knew the Lord would destroy the cities if he found them to be as wicked as they seemed, and he thought of Lot. Now, we remember that Lot had gone back to live again in Sodom after Abraham and his servants had rescued him and his family from the enemy's camp. Abraham knew that Lot too might perish if the cities should be destroyed. And he loved Lot. He wished once more to try to save him, so he said, &quot;Will you destroy the righteous persons in the city, will you not spare the lives of all for their sake'?&quot; And the Lord promised to spare Sodom if he could find fifty righteous persons in it.<br>
                           <br>
Abraham feared that there might be less than fifty. And he was troubled for Lot's safety. So he spoke again. &quot;I know that I am but a common man, made of dust,&quot; said he, &quot;yet I speak to the Lord. If there should be only forty-five righteous persons living in Sodom, will you spare the city ?&quot; And the Lord said he would spare the city for the sake of only forty-five righteous persons.<br>
                           <br>
Still Abraham felt troubled. He feared there might not be even forty-five. So he asked if the city might be spared for the sake of forty. The Lord knew it was Abraham's love for the people which to plead so earnestly for Sodom, and he promised to spare the city for the sake of forty.<br>
                           <br>
&quot;What,&quot; thought poor, distressed Abraham, &quot;if there should not be even forty righteous persons found in Sodom?&quot; And once more he spoke. &quot;0 Lord, be not angry with me,&quot; he said, &quot;but if there are only thirty righteous persons, will you spare the city for their sakes. And the Lord promised to spare the entire city if only thirty people could be found in it. Abraham continued to plead until he had asked the Lord if he would spare the city if only ten righteous persons were found, and the Lord promised to spare Sodom if he could find only ten. Then the Lord passed on, and Abraham returned to his tent.<br>

11. Genesis 19</strong><br>
THE LONG SHADOWS of evening-time were stealing over the through the valleys, and everywhere people were hurrying home. Soon the city gates would be closed, and the wise men who sat there during the daytime to judge the people would be turning homeward, too.<br>
                           <br>
Among the wise men who sat in Sodom's gate was Lot. On this evening he saw two strangers approaching, and he greeted them with a low bow, just as Abraham had greeted these same men earlier in day. For they were no other than the angels who had dined with the Lord at Abraham's tent. Lot invited them to his home to spend the night, but they said they would stay out in the streets. Now, Lot knew the wicked men of Sodom would try to harm them if they remained in the streets, so he urged them to come with him. Finally they consented.<br>
                           <br>
Here again the angels were entertained with hospitality, which may have reminded them of Abraham's kindness, for Lot brought water to wash their dusty feet and prepared good things for them to eat. Possibly Lot did not yet know that they were heavenly beings; but he thought they were strangers unlike the wicked men who lived in that city.<br>
                           <br>
Soon the news spread all over Sodom that Lot had two strange-looking visitors at his home, and men came hurrying from every part of the city to see them. They planned to hurt them. But when Lot refused to let them see his guests, they pushed him aside and tried to break open the door. At this the angels drew Lot quickly inside, and then smote the men with blindness.<br>
                           <br>
Now Lot knew that his visitors were angels, and that they had come to destroy Sodom because it was such a wicked place. He went out to the homes of his sons-in-law, two men of Sodom, and told them that the Lord was going to destroy their city. But they would not believe his words. And they would not listen when he told them to hurry and escape for their lives. So the night passed by.<br>
                           <br>
When the early morning came, before the sun lightened the earth, the angels urged Lot and his wife and their two daughters to make haste and flee out of the city lest they also be destroyed. How hard it seemed for Lot to leave his home and his riches to be destroyed! God was merciful to him, and the angels seized him and his family and dragged them outside the city. Then they bade them flee to the mountains for their lives, and not even pause long enough to take a backward glance toward their old home, because God would soon destroy the cities of that rich valley, and unless they hurried away they too should perish. But Lot's wife did not obey the angel's words. She looked back, and her body became changed into a pillar of salt.<br>
                           <br>
Poor, unhappy Lot! fear now tormented him from every direction. He thought his life would not be safe even in the mountains, for wild animals might devour him there. So he prayed to God to spare a small city near by and allow him and his daughters to enter that place. God heard his prayer and granted his request, so they fled into that city. That place was called Zoar, which means little.<br>
                           <br>
Just as the sun rose, Lot and his daughters entered the gate of. Zoar, and at that time God sent a great rain of fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah and all the neighboring cities. So terrible was the fire that it completely destroyed the cities and all the wicked people near by. Lot and his daughters feared that their lives were not safe in Zoar, so they hurried to the mountains, where God had first told them to go. There they lived in a cave-home, far away from other people. After this time we hear no more about Lot, the man whose home and riches were destroyed because he chose to live among wicked people who hated God.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>12. Genesis 20 - Genesis 21:21</strong><br>
AFTER THE DESTRUCTION of Sodom and the other cities of the plain, Abraham moved away from Hebron. He journeyed south and west, into the land of the Philistines, near the Great Sea, and made his home in a place called Gerar. Here he lived only a short when God gave to him and Sarah the child of promise. Abraham named the child Isaac (a word meaning, in his language, &quot;laughing&quot;) because both he and Sarah had laughed when God told them that they should have a son in their old age.<br>
                           <br>
When the baby Isaac grew old enough to toddle about his tent-home, and to lisp words, his father Abraham made a great feast for him. Perhaps many friends were invited, and every one knew that Isaac's parents thought he was a very wonderful little boy indeed. Before the day passed, however, something happened which brought sadness to the kind heart of Abraham.<br>
                           <br>
You remember that Ishmael, the son of Hagar, Sarah's maid, also lived in Abraham's tent. These two boys, Ishmael and Isaac, may have played together sometimes, although Ishmael was much older than Abraham's little son. On this feast-day, when everybody else was happy, Ishmael was unkind to Isaac. Perhaps he felt jealous of the honor that Isaac was receiving from so many people.<br>
                           <br>
When Sarah heard how unkindly Ishmael had treated her little boy she became angry, and called Abraham. &quot;You must send Ishmael and his mother away,&quot; she told him, &quot;for I do not want our little boy to grow up with such a rude companion.&quot; Now, Abraham loved Ishmael too, and he felt sad to hear that the boy had mistreated his son. He thought that Ishmael might learn to be kind; but God told him to send the boy and his mother away, just as Sarah had said.<br>
                           <br>
So the next morning Abraham called Hagar and told her that she must take Ishmael and go away. He gave her food for the journey and placed upon her shoulder a bottle filled with water. This bottle was not made of glass, but of the skin of an animal; for people used skin-bottles in that long-ago time. Then Abraham bade them good-by, and perhaps he watched them as they started toward the land of Egypt, where Hagar used to live when she was a little girl.<br>
                           <br>
The road to Egypt led through the same desert where the angel spoke to Hagar when she had run away from Sarah's tent. On this second journey Hagar missed the road and wandered off into the trackless wilderness. She did not know which way to take; and after a while there was no more food in her basket nor water in the bottle which Abraham had given. And the hot sun beamed down upon the dry, burning sand all day, until Hagar and Ishmael grew so thirsty, faint, and weak that they could go no farther. Then Hagar laid her suffering boy beneath the shade of a little bush, and went away. &quot;I can not bear to see him suffer and die,&quot; she said, and then she wept.<br>
                           <br>
But God had not forgotten about Hagar and her boy. Just as he had seen her on her first journey into the wilderness, so he could see her now as she sat weeping all alone. And soon she heard a voice calling to her out of heaven, &quot;What is the cause of your sorrow, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard Ishmael's cry of pain, and he will save his life and make of him a great nation. Go, now, and lift him up.&quot; Then Hagar saw a spring of water which God caused to bubble out of the dry ground near by, and she quickly filled her empty bottle and gave Ishmael a drink.<br>
                           <br>
After this Hagar and Ishmael did not journey on to Egypt, but made their home in the wilderness, far from other people. God cared for them, and Ishmael grew to be a strong, wild man. He became a hunter, and used a bow and arrow. His children also grew up in the wilderness, and were wild and strong like their father. They finally were called Arabians, and even today their descendants live in the desert and wander about wherever they please, just as Ishmael, their forefather, did so long ago.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>13. Genesis 22:1-20</strong><br>
IT IS GOD'S will that people show their love for him by what they do. You remember how God wished to have the first man and woman show their love for him. He planted in their garden-home a test-tree, the fruit of which he commanded them not to eat. And you remember also how they failed to obey his command, and so failed to show their love.<br>
                           <br>
Abraham always listened to God's voice and obeyed. He left his own people and his homeland to journey into a country that he did not know, because God called him. And in our last story he sent Ishmael and Hagar away because God told him to do as Sarah had said. Even when it did not seem easy to obey, Abraham was always ready to do God's bidding.<br>
                           <br>
After the baby Isaac came into Abraham's life, God saw that Abraham's love for the little boy was very strong. And the passing years increased this love, because Abraham knew that Isaac was the child God had promised, and he loved Isaac as a gift from God. He looked forward to the time when Isaac should become a man and should have children also, and he knew that these children should grow up and become the fathers of more people, because God had told him these things. And so whenever he looked upon Isaac and thought about these things, he knew that in this child were bound up all the promises of God for the coming years.<br>
                           <br>
By and by the time came when Isaac grew far away from baby-hood into youth. Abraham had taught him to know about God and to worship him. Perhaps he had taken Isaac with him when he offered gifts upon the altar, and he had told Isaac that God would accept the gifts and hear his prayers if he would try to do right. And Isaac loved his father Abraham, and was obedient to. him.<br>
                           <br>
When God saw how dearly Abraham loved his son, and how obedient and loving Isaac was toward his father, he thought, &quot;I must prove Abraham this once more, and see whether he loves me better than he loves the gift-child I have given.&quot; So he called to Abraham one day, and Abraham answered, &quot;Behold, here am I.&quot; Then God said, &quot;Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love so much, and go into the land of Moriah. There give him back to me as an offering upon an altar, which you must build at the place I will show.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Abraham did not know the reason why God should ask him to give Isaac back as an offering. He could not understand how the promises concerning Isaac would be fulfilled if now he must offer Isaac upon an altar, just like the lambs which he had given to God at other times. But Abraham believed that God understood why, and so he was not afraid to obey.<br>
                           <br>
The land of Moriah was some distance from Abraham's tent, and the journey there would require a few days' time. Abraham knew this, and he prepared to start at once. He called two young men servants and Isaac, then saddled his donkey, and they started away. They took wood and fire with which to burn the offering, and traveled on and on for two days, sleeping at night under the trees. On the third day Abraham saw the mountain where God wanted him to build the altar and offer his gift. He left the servants with the donkey to wait by the roadside, while he and Isaac should go on alone. Isaac carried the wood upon his shoulder, and Abraham took the vessel containing the fire.<br>
                           <br>
As they climbed the mountain-side together, Isaac began to wonder why his father had forgotten to bring a lamb for an offering. He did not know what God had asked Abraham to give. He did not understand why they were going so far from home to build the altar. So he said, &quot;My father, see, here is wood and fire for the altar, but where is the lamb for an offering?&quot; Abraham replied, &quot;God will provide himself a lamb.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
When they reached the place God had appointed, Abraham built an altar, laid the wood upon it, and then bound Isaac's hands and feet and placed him upon the wood. Next he took his knife, and was about to kill Isaac when a loud voice called to him out of the sky, &quot;Abraham! Abraham!&quot; The old man stopped to listen, and the angel of God said to him, &quot;Do not harm Isaac. Now I know that you love God even better than you love your child. Untie his hands and his feet, and let him go.&quot; At this Abraham saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket near by. He took this animal and offered it instead of his son Isaac.<br>
                           <br>
Afterward the angel called to Abraham from the sky again, and said, &quot;Because you have not withheld your dearly loved child from me, I will surely bless you and will cause your descendants to be as many as the stars in the heavens and as the sands upon the seashore. And I will bless all the nations of the earth through your descendants, because you have obeyed my voice.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
No doubt it was a happy father and son who walked down the mountain-side together; for now Abraham knew that he had surely pleased God, and Isaac knew that his life was precious in God's sight. Abraham called the name of the place where he built the altar, Jehovah Jireh, which means in his language, &quot;The Lord will provide.&quot; Then they returned to the young men servants who were wait-ing by the roadside, and then journeyed on to their home at Beersheba., where Abraham had planted trees and digged a well some time before this story. Here Abraham lived for many years.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>14. Genesis 23:1 - Genesis 25:18</strong><br>
WHEN SARAH, ISAAC'S mother, was one hundred and twenty-seven years old, she died. Abraham had no place to bury her, so he bought a field containing a cave,, and Abraham buried Sarah in this cave. The field and the cave were called by the name of Machpelah.<br>
                           <br>
After Sarah's death, Abraham and Isaac felt lonely. Isaac was now grown to manhood, and Abraham thought he was old enough to be married. The parents usually choose wives for their sons, and husbands for their daughters, in those countries, and Abraham wished to choose a good wife for Isaac. He knew that the women who lived in Canaan were idol-worshipers, and that they would not teach their children to love the true God. Because he wanted Isaac's children to serve God, he would not choose a woman of Canaan to be Isaac's wife.<br>
                           <br>
Then Abraham remembered the news that had come to him from his brother Nahor, who lived at Haran, the place in the country of Mesopotamia where his aged father had died. Nahor was now the father of twelve sons. &quot;Perhaps I can send back to my own people at Haran,&quot; thought Abraham, &quot;and find a wife for Isaac.&quot; So he called his trusted servant,Eliezer, and asked him to journey back to Haran and try to find a God-fearing wife for Isaac.<br>
                           <br>
Eliezer knew that such a journey would require many days' time and would be attended by many dangers along the way. He knew, too, that Abraham's people might not be willing to send a daughter so far from home to become the wife of a man whom they had never met. But because he was a faithful servant Eliezer said, &quot;I will go.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Then the long journey began. Eliezer took with him ten camels, several attendant servants, and many valuable presents. For days and days they traveled, crossing valleys, hills, and rivers, and edging alongside the great, lonely desert. By and by they came to the northern part of Mesopotamia, and then at last their tired camels stopped outside the city of Haran and knelt down near a well.<br>
                           <br>
It was evening time, and the women of the city were coming to this well to fill their pitchers with water. Eliezer had learned to trust in Abraham's God, and now he lifted up his heart and prayed that God would send out to this well the young woman who would be suitable for Isaac's wife. &quot;Let it come to pass, 0 Lord,&quot; he prayed, &quot;that the young woman of whom I shall ask a drink may offer to draw water for my camels also. By this sign I shall know that she is the one whom you have chosen, for Abraham's sake, to he the wife of Isaac.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
While Eliezer was praying, a beautiful young woman approached, with an earthen pitcher upon her shoulder. Eliezer waited until she had filled the pitcher with water, then he asked for a drink. Although he was a stranger, she spoke kindly to him and said she would draw water for his camels also. Again and again she filled her pitcher and poured its contents into the trough that the thirsty animals might drink. When she had done this, Eliezer gave her some of the beautiful presents that he had brought, and asked whose daughter she was and whether her people could supply lodging for him and for his camels. At her reply that she was the granddaughter of Nahor, Abraham's brother, Eliezer knew that his prayer had been answered, and he bowed his head and worshiped God. Then Rebekah-for this was the young woman's name -told Eliezer that there was plenty of room in her father's house to lodge them all, and she hurried to tell what had happened at the well and to show the beautiful presents that Eliezer had given her.<br>
                           <br>
When her brother Laban heard her story and saw the costly ornaments which Eliezer had given to Rebekah, he ran eagerly to meet the strangers at the well and to invite them to come in. &quot;We have room for you and for your camels,&quot; he told them, and they went with him into the city. Laban now showed the same kindness to his guests that Abraham and Lot had shown to their angel visitors. He first brought water to wash their feet and then set food before them.<br>
                           <br>
But Eliezer could not eat. &quot;First let me tell why I have come,&quot; he said. &quot;I am Abraham's servant, and God has blessed my master greatly, giving him flocks and herds, silver and gold, and many servants, besides camels and asses. God also gave to him and Sarah a son in their old age, and now Abraham has given all his great riches to his son. But as yet this son, Isaac, has no wife, and Abraham will not take a wife for him from the daughters of Canaan, because they worship idols. He has sent me, therefore, to you, to find a wife for Isaac.&quot; Eliezer told also how Rebekah, in answer to his prayer, had offered drink to him and to his thirsty animals.<br>
                           <br>
Rebekah's father and brother Laban were willing to let her go back with Eliezer because they believed that God had sent him. And Rebekah, too, was willing to go. Eliezer was grateful to know of their willingness, and he bowed his head once more to worship the great God who had helped him on his journey. Afterward he enjoyed the feast which Rebekah's people had prepared for them. That same night he gave other presents of silver and gold and beautiful clothing to Rebekah, and to her mother and brother.<br>
                           <br>
The next morning Eliezer said, &quot;Now let me return to my master.&quot; Laban and his mother did not want to let Rebekah leave them so soon. &quot;Can you not stay for a few more days?&quot;, they asked. But when Eliezer insisted that he must go at once, they called Rebekah, and she said, &quot;I will go.&quot; So they bade her good-by and sent her away with her nurse and other attending maids.<br>
                           <br>
On the homeward journey Rebekah and her maids rode the camels, and Eliezer led the way to Canaan. Very likely they traveled the same road that Abraham had traveled many years before, when he went with Sarah and Lot to the land that God had promised. At last they drew near to the place where Abraham and Isaac now lived. The evening shadows were stealing through the trees, and Isaac was out in the fields alone, thinking about God, when he saw the camels coming. He hurried to meet them, and Rebekah, seeing him, asked who he was. &quot;This is my master, Isaac,&quot; Eliezer replied, and Rebekah alighted from her camel and covered her face with a veil.<br>
                           <br>
When Isaac met them, Eliezer told how God had answered his prayers and had sent Rebekah to him. Isaac took her to his mother's tent, and she became his wife. He loved her, and did not grieve any more because of his mother's death.<br>
                           <br>
The time passed on, and finally Abraham died, too. He had reached the age of one hundred and seventy-five. Ishmael heard of his death and came to help Isaac bury his father. They placed his body in the cave where Sarah had been buried.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>15. Genesis 5:15 - Genesis 27:41</strong><br>
AFTER ABRAHAM DIED, his son Isaac lived in the land of Canaan. Like his father, Isaac had his home in a tent; around him were the tents of his people, and many flocks of sheep and herds of cattle feeding wherever they could find grass to eat and water to drink.<br>
                           <br>
Isaac and his wife Rebekah had two children. The older was named Esau and the younger Jacob.<br>
                           <br>
Esau was a man of the woods and very fond of hunting; and he was rough and covered with hair.<br>
                           <br>
Jacob was quiet and thoughtful, staying at home, dwelling in a tent, and caring for the flocks of his father.<br>
                           <br>
Isaac loved Esau more than Jacob, because Esau brought to his father that which he had killed in his hunting; but Rebekah liked Jacob, because she saw that he was wise and careful in his work.<br>
                           <br>
Among the people in those lands, when a man dies, his older son receives twice as much as the younger of what the father has owned. This was called his &quot;birthright,&quot; for it was his right as the oldest born. So Esau, as the older, had a &quot;birthright&quot; to more of Isaac's possessions than Jacob. And besides this, there was the privilege of the promise of God that the family of Isaac should receive great blessings.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>THE SALE OF A BIRTHRIGHT</strong><br>
Now Esau, when he grew up, did not care for his birthright or the blessing which God had promised. But Jacob, who was a wise man, wished greatly to have the birthright which would come to Esau when his father died. Once, when Esau came home, hungry and tired from hunting in the fields, he saw that Jacob had a bowl of something that he had just cooked for dinner. And Esau said:<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Give me some of that red stuff in the dish. Will you not give me some? I am hungry.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Jacob answered, &quot;I will give it to you, if you will first of all sell to me your birthright.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Esau said, &quot;What is the use of the birth-right to me now, when I am almost starving to death? You can have my birthright if you will give me something to eat.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Then Esau made Jacob a solemn promise to give to Jacob his birthright, all for a bowl of food. It was not right for Jacob to deal so selfishly with his brother; but it was very wrong in Esau to care so little for his birthright and God's blessing.<br>
                           <br>
Some time after this, when Esau was forty years old, he married two wives. Though this would be very wicked in our times, it was not supposed to be wrong then; for even good men then had more than one wife. But Esau's two wives were women from the people of Canaan, who worshipped idols, and not the true God. And they taught their children also to pray to idols; so that those who came from Esau, the people who were his descendants, lost all knowledge of God, and became very wicked. But this was long after that time.<br>
                           <br>
Isaac and Rebekah were very sorry to have their son Esau marry women who prayed to idols and not to God; but still Isaac loved his active son Esau more than his quiet son Jacob. But Rebekah loved Jacob more than Esau. Isaac became at last very old and feeble, and so blind that he could see scarcely anything. One day he said to Esau:<br>
                           <br>
&quot;My son, I am very old, and do not know how soon I must die. But before I die, I wish to give to you, as my older son, God's blessing upon you, and your children, and your descendants. Go out into the fields, and with your bow and arrows shoot some animal that is good for food, and make for me a dish of cooked meat such as you know I love; and after I have eaten it I will give you the blessing.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Now Esau ought to have told his father that the blessing did not belong to him, for he had sold it to his brother Jacob. But he did not tell his father. He went out into the fields hunting, to find the kind of meat which his father liked the most.<br>
                           <br>
Now Rebekah was listening, and heard all that Isaac had said to Esau. She knew that it would be better for Jacob to have the blessing than for Esau; and she loved Jacob more than Esau. So she called to Jacob and told him what Isaac had said to Esau, and she said:<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Now, my son, do what I tell you, and you will get the blessing instead of your brother. Go to the flocks and bring to me two little kids from the goats, and I will cook them just like the meat which Esau cooks for your father. And you will bring it to your father, and he will think that you are Esau, and will give you the blessing; and it really belongs to you.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
But Jacob said, &quot;You know that Esau and I are not alike, His neck and arms are covered with hairs, while mine are smooth. My father will feel of me, and he will find that I am not Esau; and then, instead of giving me a blessing, I am afraid that he will curse me.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
But Rebekah answered her son, &quot;Never mind; you do as I have told you, and I will take care of you. If any harm comes it will come to me; so do not be afraid, but go and bring the meat.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Then Jacob went and brought a pair of little kids from the flocks, and from them his mother made a dish of food, so that it would be to the taste just as Isaac liked it. Then Rebekah found some of Esau's clothes, and dressed Jacob in them; and she placed on his neck and hands some of the skins of the kids, so that his neck and his hands would feel rough and hairy to the touch.<br>
                           <br>
Then Jacob came into his father's tent, bringing the dinner, and speaking as much like Esau as he could, he said:<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Here I am, my father.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Isaac said, &quot;Who are you, my son?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Jacob answered, &quot;I am Esau, your oldest son; I have done as you bade me; now sit up and eat the dinner that I have made, and then give me your blessing as you promised me.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Isaac said, &quot;How is it that you found it so quickly?&quot; Jacob answered, &quot;Because the Lord your God showed me where to go and gave me good success.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Isaac did not feel certain that it was his son Esau, and he said, &quot;Come near and let me feel you, so that I may know that you are really my son Esau.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Jacob went up close to Isaac's bed, and a Isaac felt of his face, and his neck, and his hands, and he said:<br>
                           <br>
&quot;The voice sounds like Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau. Are you really my son Esau?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Jacob told a lie to his father, and said, &quot;I am.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Then the old man ate the food that Jacob had brought to him; and he kissed Jacob, believing him to be Esau; and he gave him the blessing, Saying to him:<br>
                           <br>
&quot;May God give you the dew of heaven, and the richness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine. May nations bow down to you and peoples become your servants. May you be the master over your brother, and may your family and descendants that shall come from you rule over his family and his descendants. Blessed be those that bless you, and cursed be those that curse you.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Just as soon as Jacob had received the blessing he rose up and hastened away. He had scarcely gone out, when Esau came in from hunting, with the dish of food that he had cooked. And he said:<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Let my father sit up and eat the food that I have brought, and give me the blessing.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Isaac said, &quot;Why, who are you?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Esau answered, &quot;I am your son; your oldest son, Esau.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Isaac trembled, and said, &quot;Who then is the one that came in and brought to me food? and I have eaten his food and have blessed him; yes, and he shall be blessed.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
When Esau heard this, he knew that he had been cheated; and he cried aloud, with a bitter cry, &quot;0, my father, my brother has taken away my blessing, just as he took away my birthright! But cannot you give me another blessing, too? Have you given everything to my brother?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
And Isaac told him all that he had said to Jacob, making him the ruler over his brother.<br>
                           <br>
But Esau begged for another blessing; and Isaac said:<br>
                           <br>
&quot;My son, your dwelling shall be of the riches of the earth and of the dew of heaven. You shall live by your sword and your descendants shall serve his descendants. But in time to come they shall break loose and shall shake off the yoke of your brother's rule and shall be free.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
All this came to pass many years afterward. The people who came from Esau lived in a land called Edom, on the south of the land of Israel, where Jacob's descendants lived. And after a time the Israelites became rulers over the Edomites; and later still, the Edomites made themselves free from the Israelites. But all this took place hundreds of years afterward.<br>
                           <br>
It was better that Jacob's descendants, those who came after him, should have the blessing, than that Esau's people should have it; for Jacob's people worshipped God, and Esau's people walked in the way of the idols and became wicked.<br>

                           <strong>16. Genesis 27:42 - Genesis 29:12</strong><br>
AFTER ESAU FOUND that he had lost his birth-right and his blessing, he was very angry against his brother Jacob; and he said to himself, and told others:<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My father Isaac is very old and cannot live long. As soon as he is dead, then I shall kill Jacob for having robbed me of my right.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rebekah heard this, she said to Jacob, &quot;Before it is too late, do you go away from home and get out of Esau's sight. Perhaps when Esau sees you no longer, he will forget his anger, and then you can come home again. Go and visit my brother Laban, your uncle, in Haran, and stay with him for a little while.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must remember that Rebekah came from the family of Nahor, Abraham's younger brother, who lived in Haran, a long distance to the northeast of Canaan, and that Laban was Rebekah's brother.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Jacob went out of Beersheba, on the border of the desert, and walked alone, carrying his staff in his hand. One evening, just about sunset, he came to a place among the mountains, more than sixty miles distant from his home.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as he had no bed to lie down upon, he took a stone and rested his head upon it for a pillow, and lay down to sleep.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on that night Jacob had a wonderful dream. In his dream he saw stairs leading from the earth where he lay up to heaven; and angels were going up and coming down upon the stairs. And above the stairs, he saw the Lord God standing. And God said to Jacob:<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac your father; and I will be your God, too. The land where you are lying all alone, shall belong to you and to your children after you; and your children shall spread abroad over the lands, east and west, and north and south, like the dust of the earth; and in your family all the world shall receive a blessing. And I am with you in your journey, and I will keep you where you are going, and will bring you back to this land. I will never leave you, and I will surely keep my promise to you.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the morning Jacob awakened from his sleep, and he said:<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Surely, the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it! 5-thought that I was all alone, but God has been with me. This place is the house of God; it is the gate of heaven!&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jacob took the stone on which his head had rested, and he set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on it as an offering to God. And Jacob named that place Bethel, which in the language that Jacob spoke means &quot;The House of God.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jacob made a promise to God at that time, and said:<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If God really will go with me and will keep me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and will bring me to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God: and this stone shall be the house of God, and of all that God gives me I will give back to God one-tenth as an offering.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Jacob went onward in his long journey. He walked across the river Jordan in a shallow place, feeling his way with his staff; he climbed mountains and journeyed beside the great desert on the east, and at last came to the city of Haran. Beside the city was the well, where Abraham's servant had met Jacob's mother, Rebekah; and there, after Jacob had waited for a time, he saw a young woman coming with her sheep to give them water.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Jacob took off the flat stone that was over the mouth of the well, and drew water and gave it to the sheep. And when he found that this young woman was his own cousin Rachel, the daughter of Laban, he was so glad that he wept for joy. And at that moment he began to love Rachel, and longed to have her for his wife.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel's father, Laban, who was Jacob's uncle, gave a welcome to Jacob, and took him into his home.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jacob asked Laban if he would give his daughter, Rachel, to him as his wife; and Jacob said, &quot;If you give me Rachel, I will work for you ' seven years.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Laban said, &quot;It is better that you should have her, than that a stranger should marry her.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Jacob lived seven years in Laban's house, caring for his sheep and oxen and camels; but his love for Rachel made the time seem short.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last the day came for the marriage; and they brought in the bride, who, after the manner of that land, was covered with a thick veil, so that her face could not be seen. And she was married to Jacob, and when Jacob lifted up her veil he found that he had married, not Rachel, but her older sister, Leah, who was not beautiful, and whom Jacob did not love at all.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob was very angry that he had been deceived, -- though that was just the way in which Jacob himself had deceived his father and cheated his brother Esau. But his uncle Laban said:<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In our land we never allow the younger daughter to be married before the older daughter. Keep Leah for your wife, and work for me seven years longer, and you shall have Rachel also.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For in those times, as we have seen, men often had two wives, or even more than two. So Jacob stayed seven years more, fourteen years in all, before he received Rachel as his wife.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Jacob was living at Haran, eleven sons were born to him. But only one of these was the child of Rachel, whom Jacob loved. This son was Joseph, who was dearer to Jacob than any other of his children, partly because he was the youngest, and because he was the child of his beloved Rachel.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>17. Genesis 29:1-30</strong><br>
JACOB CONTINUED ON his way, getting ever farther away from his brother Esau's wrath. At last he reached Haran, the place where his uncle Laban dwelt. He saw a green field, and in the field a well. Three flocks of sheep were lying there, resting, and waiting to be watered.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Jacob drew near he greeted the shepherds and asked them whether they knew a man named Laban.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They replied, &quot;We know Laban, and here, behold, Rachel, his daughter, cometh with the sheep.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Rachel approached, looking sweet and beautiful, Jacob was deeply touched. He rolled away the stone which covered the well and watered the flock of Laban. Then he embraced his young cousin and lifted up his voice and wept.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rachel learned who Jacob was, she hastened to tell her father, Laban, and he greeted Jacob joyfully, and made him welcome in his home.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob remained in Laban's home for a month, tending the flocks and herds. When Laban asked him what wages he wanted to receive, Jacob rescued any money, but said, &quot;I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob wished to have Rachel for his bride, for he had already begun to love her dearly. Laban thought this was a very good bargain, and readily agreed.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob toiled for seven years in his uncle's service, and the time seemed to pass very quickly, for he knew that at the end of that time he would win the hand of A great wedding feast was prepared, and the wedding day came at last. Jacob was full of happiness, but, alas Laban deceived Jacob, and forced him to marry Leah, the older daughter instead. Jacob was very angry at this, but Laban explained that a younger daughter cannot marry first, but would have to wait until the older daughter was married, so that Jacob would have to work for him seven more years if he also wanted to wed Rachel.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Jacob, who had cheated his brother, was now cheated in turn.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob worked for seven more weary years, always remembering, however, that at the end of this time he would win the hand of his beloved Rachel.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after seven more years had passed, Jacob also married Rachel, and now he was happy at last.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>18. Genesis 32 to Genesis 33</strong><br>
JACOB REMAINED TWENTY years with Laban, whose daughter Rachel he had married.<br>
                           <br>
In those days men's chief riches consisted in flocks and herds; and Jacob had the care of those belonging to Laban. His uncle tried to deprive him of the wages which he had promised to give him; but, notwithstanding this, Jacob himself grew rich in cattle, and beasts of burden, and numerous servants.<br>
                           <br>
At the end of the twenty years that Jacob had been with Laban, God bade him return to his own land; so he gathered together all his possessions, and set out on his way thither.<br>
                           <br>
As Jacob still feared the anger of his brother Esau, whom he had cruelly treated, he sent messengers before him into Edom, where Esau lived, to say that he, and all his family with him, were coming, and that he hoped his brother would be friendly with him. But when his messengers returned, bringing word that Esau, with four hundred men, was advancing to meet him, he was much afraid, thinking now his brother was going to kill him.<br>
                           <br>
So he divided his people and his flocks into two companies, that if the one were attacked, the other might escape away; and when he had done all that he could for self-defense, he prayed to God that Esau might not kill him, with his children and servants.<br>
                           <br>
Then he took a great number of his cattle, his sheep and camels, and sent them on before him in separate droves, bidding the men who were with them tell Esau, when they met him, that they were a present from his servant Jacob.<br>
                           <br>
It was not long before Esau and his four hundred men came in sight; and then Jacob, putting his children in a place of safety, went forward to meet him, bowing himself down to the ground to do honor to his brother.<br>
                           <br>
But Esau, who had forgiven his brother's ill deeds, ran to him in the most loving manner, kissing him, and weeping for joy that they had at last met. And he asked him kindly about all the people with him and what was the meaning of the droves of cattle he had seen on the road.<br>
                           <br>
Jacob told him that the people were his family, and that the cattle were for a present to himself. And when Esau refused to take it, he urged him, that he might be sure his brother had forgiven him.<br>
                           <br>
Then Esau returned to his own country, and Jacob, in time, came back to the land of Canaan, as God had promised that he should do.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>19. Genesis 37</strong><br>
AFTER JACOB CAME back to the land of Canaan with his eleven sons, another son was born to him, the second child of his wife Rachel, whom Jacob loved so well. But soon after the baby came, his mother Rachel died, and Jacob was filled with sorrow. Even to this day you can see the place where Rachel was buried, on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Jacob named the child whom Rachel left, Benjamin; and now Jacob had twelve sons. Most of them were grown-up men; but Joseph was a boy seventeen years old, and his brother Benjamin was almost a baby.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all his children, Jacob loved Joseph the best, because he was Rachel's child; because he was so much younger than most of his brothers; and because he was good, and faithful, and thoughtful. Jacob gave to Joseph a robe or coat of bright colors, made somewhat like a long cloak with wide sleeves. This was a special mark of Jacob's favor to Joseph, and it made his older brothers envious of him.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, too, Joseph did what was right, while his older brothers often did very wrong acts, of which Joseph sometimes told their father; and this made them very angry at Joseph. But they hated him still more because of two strange dreams he had, and of which he told them. He said one day: &quot;Listen to this dream that I have dreamed. I dreamed that we were out in the field binding sheaves, when suddenly my sheaf stood up, and all your sheaves came around it and bowed down to my sheaf!&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they said scornfully, &quot;Do you suppose that the dream means that you will some time rule over us, and that we shall bow down to you?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, a few days after, Joseph said, &quot;I have dreamed again. This time, I saw in my dream the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars, all come and bow to me!&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his father said to him, &quot;I do not like you to dream such dreams. Shall I, and your mother, and your brothers, come and bow down before you as if you were a king?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His brothers hated Joseph, and would not speak kindly to him; but his father thought much of what Joseph had said.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time, Joseph's ten brothers were taking care of the flock in the fields near Shechem, which was nearly fifty miles from Hebron, where Jacob's tents were spread. And Jacob wished to send a message to his sons, and he called Joseph, and said to him:<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Your brothers are near Shechem with the flock. I wish that you would go to them, and take a message, and find if they are well, and if the flocks are doing well; and bring me word from them.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was quite an errand, for a boy to go alone over the country, and find his way, for fifty miles, and then walk home again. But Joseph was a boy who could take care of him-self, and could be trusted; so he went forth on his journey, walking northward over the mountains, past Bethlehem, and Jerusalem, and Bethel -- though we are not sure those cities were then built, except Jerusalem, which was already a strong city.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Joseph reached Shechem, he could not find his brothers, for they had taken their flocks to another place. A man met Joseph wandering in the field, and asked him, &quot;Whom are you seeking?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph said, &quot;I am looking for my brothers, the sons of Jacob. Can you tell me where I will find them?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the man said, &quot;They are at Dothan; or I heard them say that they were going there.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Joseph walked over the hills to Dothan, which was fifteen miles further. And his brothers saw him afar off coming toward them. They Walking knew him by his bright garment; and one said to another: &quot;Look, that dreamer is coming! Come, let us kill him, and throw his body into a pit, and tell his father that some wild beast has eaten him; and then we will see what becomes of his dreams.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of his brothers, whose name was Reuben, felt more kindly toward Joseph than the others. He said:<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Let us not kill him, but let us throw him into this pit, in the wilderness, and leave him there to die.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Reuben intended, after they had gone away, to lift Joseph out of the pit, and take him home to his father. The brothers did as Reuben told them; they threw Joseph into the pit, which was empty. He cried, and begged them to save him; but they would not. They calmly sat down to eat their dinner on the grass, while their brother was calling to them from the pit.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dinner, Reuben chanced to go to another part of the field; so that he was not at hand when a company of men passed by with their camels, going from Gilead, on the east of the river Jordan, to Egypt, to sell spices and fragrant gum from trees to the Egyptians.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Judah, another of Joseph's brothers, said, &quot;What good will it do us to kill our brother? Would it not be better for us to sell him to these men, and let them carry him away? After all, he is our brother, and we would better not kill him.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His brothers agreed with him; so they stopped the men who were passing, and drew up Joseph from the pit, and for twenty pieces of silver they sold Joseph to these men; and they took him away with them down to Egypt.<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Reuben came to the pit, where they had left Joseph, and looked into it; but Joseph was not there. Then Reuben was in great trouble; and he came back to his brothers, saying: &quot;The boy is not there! What shall I do!&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then his brothers told Reuben what they had done; and they all agreed together to deceive their father. They killed one of the goats, and dipped Joseph's coat in its blood; and they brought it to their father, and they said to him: &quot;We found this coat out in the wilderness. Look at it, father, and tell us if you think it was the coat of your son.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jacob knew it at once. He said: &quot;It is my son's coat. Some wild beast has eaten him. There is no doubt that Joseph has been torn in pieces!&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jacob's heart was broken over the loss of Joseph all the more because he had sent Joseph alone on the journey through the wilderness. They tried to comfort him, but he would not be comforted. He said: &quot;I will go down to the grave mourning for my poor lost son.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the old man sorrowed for his son Joseph; and all the time his wicked brothers knew that Joseph was not dead; but they would not tell their father the dreadful deed they had done to their brother, in selling him as a slave.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>20. Genesis 39 to Genesis 41</strong><br>
THE MERCHANTS WHO bought Joseph sold him to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who treated him very favorably, and put all his affairs under Joseph's care. But after he had served his master faithfully for some time, Joseph was falsely accused of some wrong doing; and his master, without inquiring into the matter, shut him up in prison.<br>
                           <br>
But God was with him in the prison, as He had been while Joseph was ruling over Potiphar's household; and He caused the keeper of the prison to put trust in him, so that he had the whole care of the other prisoners, and of all that was done there.<br>
                           <br>
Two of these prisoners, chief servants of Pharaoh, dreamed strange dreams, and God gave Joseph wisdom to interpret them. He told one of them that his dream signified that in three days he should be taken out of prison and hanged; the other prisoner's dream signified that in three days he should be released and restored to favor. And he begged this one, after he should be set at liberty, to try to get him also out of prison. But when the man got out of prison, he thought no more about Joseph for two whole years.<br>
                           <br>
At the end of that time, Pharaoh, to whose service he was restored, had two dreams that made him unhappy, and whose meaning none of his wise men could tell him.<br>
                           <br>
He dreamed that seven fat cattle were feeding in a meadow, and that seven lean ones came and ate them up. Again he dreamed of seven ears of good corn on one stalk, and that seven blighted ones sprang up and devoured them. And when no one could tell him what these dreams meant, the chief butler remembered how Joseph had explained to him his dream in the prison.<br>
                           <br>
So he told the king, who immediately sent for Joseph out of prison, related his dreams to him, and asked him what they signified. Joseph answered the king that in these dreams God had showed him what He was about to do: that He was going to give Egypt seven years of plenty, and after them seven years of famine. And he advised Pharaoh to seek out some discreet person whom he might set over the land of Egypt, with officers under him, to store up, during the years of plenty, corn enough to supply them in the years of famine.<br>
                           <br>
Pharaoh thought the advice was good, and that no one was so fit as Joseph to do all this; so he made him ruler. And Joseph stored up the corn, so that, when the famine came, other countries sent to Egypt to buy food.<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Wednesday, April 05, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                           <strong>Part 1: Shaggy the Brave Rat</strong><br>
In a cozy little hole beneath the floorboards of Mr. Jones' house, there lived a rat named Shaggy. Shaggy was a brave young rat, always eager to explore and discover new things. He lived there with his large family, and he was the youngest of all his siblings.<br>
                           <br>
Their life was an adventurous one. Every night, they ventured into Mr. Jones' kitchen, stealthily sneaking through the shadows, and managed to steal the most delicious morsels of food. But there was one problem – they never saved any of it. Shaggy was different from his siblings; he had a sense of responsibility. He realized that, one day, the food would run out, and they'd have nothing left to eat.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy began to make plans on food preservation. He suggested storing some of their stolen treasures, but his siblings were skeptical. They enjoyed the thrill of the heist and preferred to eat everything they found. &quot;Why worry about the future when there's food to enjoy now?&quot; they'd argue.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy's persistence paid off one day when he convinced them to save a portion of their plunder. They reluctantly agreed, and as they watched their collection grow, his siblings started to see the wisdom in Shaggy's plan.<br>
                           <br>
Just as the family began to embrace Shaggy's idea of food preservation, a rumor started to circulate among the mice and rats in the neighborhood. It was whispered that Mr. Jones was planning to go on a one-year vacation with his family! Shaggy and his siblings were left wondering what this meant for their secret life beneath the house. Would they be able to survive without their nightly escapades into the kitchen? <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 2: The Adventure Continues</strong><br>
With the news of Mr. Jones' upcoming one-year vacation spreading like wildfire among the rodents in the neighborhood, Shaggy and his family were faced with a dilemma. The prospect of no more midnight kitchen raids was both exciting and terrifying.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy, ever the strategist, saw this as an opportunity to fully implement his plan for food preservation. He gathered his siblings around and laid out his vision: they would stockpile enough food to last them through Mr. Jones' absence.<br>
                           <br>
The family worked tirelessly, making nightly trips to the kitchen while trying to avoid any other rodents who might covet their newfound treasure. Shaggy's plan began to take shape as they collected and stored food in their secret hole.<br>
                           <br>
But challenges arose along the way. The other rats in the neighborhood, hearing of Mr. Jones' absence, also sought to secure their own food supplies. A rivalry emerged, and it tested Shaggy's bravery and ingenuity. The battle for survival became a thrilling contest of wits and agility as the rats devised clever traps and strategies to outsmart each other.<br>
                           <br>
As the days turned into weeks, Shaggy's family began to realize the value of his foresight and planning. They had a stash of food that would keep them well-fed during the long year ahead. Shaggy had proven himself to be not only brave but also a wise leader, ensuring their survival.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 3: The Culinary Quest</strong><br>
As the year went on, the divided sects of the rodent community intensified their rivalry for the precious food. Some resorted to desperate measures, eating anything they could find in Mr. Jones' house. The once-thriving neighborhood of rodents had become a chaotic, primitive place where survival was the sole focus.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy's family had managed to maintain their food supply through their careful planning and teamwork. However, as the months passed, their stockpile dwindled, and they faced the same desperation that plagued the rest of the community. It was a harsh reminder that even the best-laid plans could be exhausted.<br>
                           <br>
Amid these trying times, Shaggy refused to succumb to the primitive behavior around him. He couldn't bear the thought of his family stooping down to eating anything they found. Shaggy, the brave rat, had another plan in mind – he decided to venture into cooking lessons.<br>
                           <br>
He scoured the kitchen for discarded cookbooks, watching with fascination as Mr. Jones prepared meals. Shaggy's siblings were skeptical at first, but Shaggy's determination was unwavering. He believed that the status of rats regarding their diet could be elevated. He began experimenting with small portions of food they had, creating makeshift stoves and utensils to cook with.<br>
                           <br>
Over time, Shaggy's culinary skills improved, and he introduced his family to a whole new world of flavors. They dined on cooked grains, simmered sauces, and roasted vegetables, all carefully prepared by Shaggy's tiny paws. Their diet transformed from scavenging to savoring, and Shaggy's family thrived like never before.<br>
                           <br>
As word of Shaggy's culinary expertise spread throughout the rodent community, even the rival factions put their differences aside to learn from him. The house that had once been a battleground for food became a place of culinary discovery and cooperation.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 4: A Rainy Dilemma</strong><br>
As the year of Mr. Jones' absence drew to a close, Shaggy's family, along with the other rodents, had flourished under his culinary guidance. The once-divided sects of the community now shared meals and forged new bonds. Their underground world was filled with laughter and the aroma of delicious meals.<br>
                           <br>
But when Mr. Jones returned, he was met with a shock. His house was in pieces, with gnawed furniture, shredded curtains, and holes in the walls – a result of the year-long rampage from the uninvited settlers under his house. Furious, he decided it was time to flash them out for good.<br>
                           <br>
The rodents, once hidden in the shadows, faced a new challenge. They had to find a new place to call home. Rainy season was approaching, and the underground tunnels they had lived in were now flooded with water. The rodent community was in a dire situation, and everyone turned to Shaggy for a solution.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy, with his newfound culinary and leadership skills, realized they needed to find a dry and secure place to live. He rallied the community and led them on a search for a suitable residence. They explored various options, from abandoned sheds to old tree trunks, but none seemed to provide the comfort and safety they desired.<br>
                           <br>
With the rainy season looming closer, Shaggy knew they had to make a decision quickly. The fate of the entire rodent community rested on his shoulders. With the community's future hanging in the balance, how will Shaggy overcome this latest challenge and secure a new home for his family and all the other rodents who had come to rely on him for guidance?<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 5: Cats, Rain, and Shaggy's Cunning</strong><br>
After an extensive search, Shaggy finally found a suitable residence for his community – an old, abandoned garden shed. It was dry, secure, and spacious, perfect for their needs. With the rainy season approaching, the rodents moved in and felt a renewed sense of security.<br>
                           <br>
However, their newfound haven came with an unexpected twist. The garden shed had once been home to a family of cats, but they had temporarily vacated the place due to the heavy rains. Unbeknownst to the rodents, the felines had plans to return once the weather improved.<br>
                           <br>
One day, as the sun emerged from the clouds and the rain ceased, the cats made their triumphant return. To their surprise, they discovered the shed occupied by a colony of rats and mice. The cats' territory had been invaded by these &quot;delicious&quot; interlopers.<br>
                           <br>
In this dire situation, Shaggy knew he needed a solution to avoid a feline disaster. He called a meeting with the other rodents and proposed a plan. They would use their culinary skills to create a feast that would appeal to the cats, distracting them from the idea of hunting. Shaggy believed that if the cats were well-fed, they might coexist peacefully.<br>
                           <br>
With their collective effort, they prepared a grand banquet of the most delectable dishes, each one carefully seasoned and flavored to perfection. The scent wafted through the shed, enticing the cats, who couldn't resist the temptation.<br>
                           <br>
The cats, upon discovering this irresistible feast, decided to indulge in the culinary offerings rather than pursue the rodents. The cleverly prepared meals captured their attention, and they were soon lost in the world of flavors.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy's culinary skills had once again saved the day. The cats and rodents coexisted in the shed, enjoying their meals together, and the community thrived. But will this co-existence with the enemy last forever?<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 6: A Delicate Balance</strong><br>
As time passed in their shared haven, a delicate balance had emerged between the rodents and the cats. The rodents, led by Shaggy, continued to prepare spacious and delightful meals for the feline inhabitants, ensuring their contentment and cooperation. In return, the cats provided security, deterring other potential threats that lurked in the garden.<br>
                           <br>
However, this interdependence carried within it a potential crisis. One day, the cats returned from their daily patrol, reporting that a family of raccoons had taken an interest in the garden and were eyeing the shed as a potential source of food. The raccoons were formidable adversaries, much larger and more cunning than the cats, and they posed a significant threat to both the rodents and the felines.<br>
                           <br>
This dilemma put a strain on the delicate balance that Shaggy had worked so hard to establish. The cats were unable to defend the shed against the raccoons, and the rodents couldn't prepare their meals with the threat looming outside.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy, being the brave and resourceful leader that he was known to be, recognized that it was time to step up and find a solution. Will Shaggy address this crisis, as the rodents' culinary skills and the cats' protection were both essential to their coexistence?<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 7: Shaggy's Ingenious Accord<em><br>
                              </em></strong>Faced with the imminent threat of the raccoons and the delicate balance hanging in the balance, Shaggy gathered both rodents and cats for an emergency meeting. In his tiny yet determined voice, he proposed an ingenious accord that would not only preserve their coexistence but strengthen their bonds.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy suggested creating a joint task force, comprised of both cats and rodents, to stand united against the raccoon invasion. The rodents would contribute their nimble agility and knowledge of the shed's interior, while the cats would lend their strength and predatory instincts. Together, they could fortify their shared home and repel the raccoons.<br>
                           <br>
To address the issue of meal preparation, Shaggy proposed a rotating schedule. Some days, the cats would take charge of patrolling and defending, allowing the rodents uninterrupted time to prepare their spacious meals. On other days, the roles would switch, ensuring that both species played a crucial part in the survival of the community.<br>
                           <br>
This collaborative approach not only addressed the immediate crisis but also fostered a deeper understanding and respect between the two groups. The cats realized the value of the rodents' culinary skills, and the rodents appreciated the protection and security provided by their feline companions.<br>
                           <br>
As the joint task force sprung into action, fortifying the shed and preparing for the raccoon threat, Shaggy's leadership and innovative thinking once again saved the day. The crisis became an opportunity for the rodents and cats to forge an unbreakable bond, proving that through cooperation and understanding, even the most challenging dilemmas could be overcome.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 8: A Garden United<em><br>
                              </em></strong>The joint efforts of rodents and cats, orchestrated by Shaggy's ingenious accord, proved to be a resounding success. The raccoon threat was thwarted, and a newfound sense of unity permeated the once-divided community under Mr. Jones' garden shed.<br>
                           <br>
As days turned into weeks, the rodents and cats not only defended their shared home but also worked collaboratively on various tasks. Cats became adept at assisting in the kitchen, offering their hunting skills to acquire fresh ingredients, while the rodents helped maintain the shed's infrastructure, creating a harmonious synergy between the two species.<br>
                           <br>
However, a new challenge emerged as winter approached. The shed, though secure from external threats, lacked proper insulation, and the rodents and cats faced the prospect of enduring a harsh and cold season. Shaggy, ever the forward thinker, gathered the community once again to discuss a solution.<br>
                           <br>
In the face of this winter dilemma, Shaggy proposed a grand project: the construction of a cozy, communal space within the shed. The rodents would use their resourcefulness to gather materials, while the cats would provide the necessary protection during the construction process. Together, they would create a warm haven where both species could weather the winter.<br>
                           <br>
The collaborative construction not only strengthened the physical structure of their home but also deepened the bonds of friendship between the rodents and cats. As the communal space took shape, adorned with makeshift furniture and insulated with gathered materials, the rodents and cats found themselves not just as neighbors, but as a united family.<br>
                           <br>

                              </em></strong>As winter tightened its grip, Mr. Jones, oblivious to the bustling community thriving beneath his garden shed, decided to do some routine maintenance. Armed with tools and a curious spirit, he ventured into the shed, expecting nothing out of the ordinary.<br>
                           <br>
To his surprise, Mr. Jones uncovered the rodents and cats coexisting harmoniously in their meticulously crafted communal space. Shock and disbelief filled his expression as he took in the sight of his once-abandoned shed transformed into a haven for the most unlikely of companions.<br>
                           <br>
The rodents paused in their activities, their tiny faces filled with a mix of fear and curiosity. The cats, equally caught off guard, eyed Mr. Jones with a blend of wariness and vigilance. The delicate balance Shaggy had worked so hard to establish now hung in the balance as the humans and the animal community faced each other.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 10: A Home Shared - i<em><br>
                              </em></strong>In the wake of the surprising discovery, Mr. Jones stood in the entrance of the transformed shed, his initial shock giving way to a range of emotions. The rodents and cats, unsure of their fate, awaited his reaction with bated breath.<br>
                           <br>
To everyone's astonishment, Mr. Jones, instead of expressing anger or frustration, broke into a warm smile. He observed the camaraderie among the animals and the ingenious use of the space he had long neglected. The initial tension gave way to a moment of understanding.<br>
                           <br>
Shaggy, always the diplomat, approached Mr. Jones with a mixture of courage and diplomacy. In a series of squeaks, nods, and expressive gestures, Shaggy conveyed the story of their journey, the challenges they faced, and the unlikely unity that had blossomed beneath his shed. The animals, once seen as intruders, now stood before Mr. Jones as a testament to the extraordinary bond they had formed.<br>
                           <br>
As the story unfolded, Mr. Jones found himself captivated by the resilience and resourcefulness of Shaggy and his community. Instead of evicting them, he decided to embrace this unexpected turn of events. The shed, once a forgotten corner of his garden, had become a symbol of shared life, understanding, and friendship.<br>
                           <br>
In a heartwarming gesture, Mr. Jones, with Shaggy's guidance, contributed to the communal space. He brought in old blankets, cushions, and even a small heater to make their winter refuge cozier. The once-divided space now became a true home shared by humans and animals alike.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Part 10: A Home Shared - ii<br>
                           </strong>In the wake of Mr. Jones' acceptance, an air of joy and celebration filled the shed. The rodents scurried about, putting their culinary skills to the test in preparation for a feast to commemorate the newfound alliance.<br>
                           <br>
As Mr. Jones looked on with curiosity, Shaggy and his family, along with their feline friends, orchestrated a culinary masterpiece. They gathered ingredients, seasoned dishes, and worked together with a level of coordination that left Mr. Jones in awe.<br>
                           <br>
When the feast was laid out, a spread of flavors and aromas that rivaled any human kitchen greeted Mr. Jones. The rodents had not only mastered the art of survival but had elevated their culinary prowess to a level that surprised even themselves.<br>
                           <br>
The animals gathered around the communal table, and Mr. Jones, unable to contain his amazement, tasted the dishes prepared by his unexpected cohabitants. To his astonishment, the flavors were exquisite, a testament to Shaggy's leadership and the collective efforts of the entire community.<br>
                           <br>
The shared feast became a symbol of unity, breaking down the barriers between species and creating a bond that transcended the ordinary. Mr. Jones, with newfound appreciation, toasted to this extraordinary alliance, celebrating not only the resilience of Shaggy and his community but the unexpected joy of a shared home.<br>

                              </em>Part 1: The Arrival of Scoopy<em><br>
                              </em></strong>Once upon a time, in the heart of the lush Enchanted Forest, three delicate eggs adorned a cozy nest nestled high up in a sturdy tree. The morning sun painted the sky with hues of pink and gold as a tiny bird named Scoopy prepared for its grand entrance into the world.<br>
                           <br>
In the quiet embrace of the forest, the first signs of life stirred within one of the fragile eggs. A soft tapping sound echoed through the leaves, capturing the attention of the woodland creatures. Scoopy, with determination in its tiny beak, embarked on the enchanting journey of breaking free from its protective shell.<br>
                           <br>
The other two eggs, unfortunately, never had the chance to share in this magical moment. Predators, lurking in the shadows, claimed them before they could hatch. The Enchanted Forest, while brimming with beauty, held its share of dangers, casting a bittersweet shadow over the arrival of Scoopy.<br>
                           <br>
As the forest whispered tales of mysteries and wonders, Scoopy emerged—a fluffy ball of feathers, wide-eyed and curious. The rustling leaves and gentle breeze became the first companions of this brave young bird. Yet, little did Scoopy know, the protective wings of its parents would never shield it, for they had met a fate as cruel as the shadows that prowled in the depths of the Enchanted Forest.<br>
                           <br>
Alone in the nest, Scoopy looked around with innocent eyes, unaware of the challenges that lay ahead. The forest held its breath, witnessing the beginning of a tale that would unfold with each beat of Scoopy's tiny heart. And so, in the soft glow of the morning sun, the story of Scoopy's extraordinary journey commenced.<br>

                              </em></strong>As the sun continued its golden dance across the Enchanted Forest, Scoopy, the brave young bird, had successfully broken free from its eggshell. However, instead of the warm embrace of parents, Scoopy found itself in a quiet nest, surrounded by the rustling leaves and a gentle breeze. The forest had become its sole companion.<br>
                           <br>
Alone in the nest, Scoopy peered over the edge, observing the world below with curious eyes. The forest, once a mysterious tapestry of life, now stretched out as an endless playground waiting to be explored. The song of distant birds and the chatter of woodland creatures filled the air, creating a symphony that echoed through the trees.<br>
                           <br>
Yet, the absence of parental guidance weighed on Scoopy's tiny heart. Where were the wise whispers of motherly advice or the comforting warmth of a father's presence? The forest remained silent, offering no answers. It was in this solitude that Scoopy's unconventional journey began—a journey that would be marked by the friendships of the unlikeliest companions.<br>
                           <br>
As days turned into nights, Scoopy's resilience grew. The fluffy ball of feathers found solace in the company of friendly forest creatures. Squirrels became playmates, butterflies shared colorful stories, and wise old owls offered guidance. Though Scoopy lacked the traditional family structure, the Enchanted Forest, in its magical way, provided support and companionship.<br>
                           <br>
And so, perched high in the nest, surrounded by the enchanting beauty of nature, Scoopy embraced its newfound family—the creatures of the forest. Unbeknownst to the little bird, these unconventional bonds would shape its destiny, offering strength and lessons as it navigated the challenges that awaited in the vast and wondrous world beyond the nest.<br>
                           <br>

                              </em></strong>In the heart of the Enchanted Forest, where the branches intertwined like old friends, Scoopy's days unfolded in the company of its newfound companions. The squirrels, with their playful antics, became lively playmates, racing along the branches with the energetic fervor only woodland creatures possessed.<br>
                           <br>
Butterflies, with wings painted in the most enchanting hues, fluttered around Scoopy, sharing colorful tales of their journeys from flower to flower. Each story added a sprinkle of magic to the young bird's world, as it listened with wide-eyed wonder, absorbing the beauty of the forest's storytelling symphony.<br>
                           <br>
In the midst of this unconventional family, wise old owls perched on ancient branches, offering Scoopy guidance. They spoke of the moonlit mysteries and the secrets hidden within the rustling leaves. These nocturnal mentors became the storytellers of the night, sharing ancient wisdom that echoed through the Enchanted Forest like a soothing lullaby.<br>
                           <br>
As Scoopy grew, so did the bonds with its friendly neighbors. The forest, once a vast and mysterious realm, transformed into a playground filled with laughter, wisdom, and the fluttering of delicate wings. Each day became an adventure, as Scoopy danced through the treetops, guided by the whimsical rhythm of the forest's heartbeat.<br>
                           <br>
In the absence of parental wings, Scoopy had woven a tapestry of friendship with the creatures of the Enchanted Forest. The unconventional family, though diverse in shapes and sizes, had become a source of comfort and joy. Little did Scoopy know that these heartwarming connections would serve as stepping stones, paving the way for a journey beyond the familiar branches, into the vast wonders that awaited in the magical world of the Enchanted Forest.<br>
                           <br>

                              </em></strong>As the sun painted the Enchanted Forest in warm hues, Scoopy's wings, once tiny and fragile, grew stronger with each passing day. The treetops, once an unexplored realm, now beckoned to the young bird with the promise of adventure. It was time for Scoopy to take flight and embrace the magic of soaring through the enchanted skies.<br>
                           <br>

                              </em></strong>In a bustling meadow, nestled among blooming flowers, stood a vibrant beehive teeming with life. Within its hexagonal chambers lived Benny, a young bee with an insatiable curiosity. Benny was unlike the others – while most bees were content with the routine of gathering nectar and tending to the hive, he yearned for adventure beyond the familiar petals.<br>
                           <br>
One sunny morning, as the meadow hummed with the gentle whispers of the wind, Benny gazed at the horizon, his wings aching to explore the vast world outside. The hive, abuzz with activity, faced a challenge – their once plentiful nectar sources were dwindling, and a sense of worry hung in the air. Benny, perceptive and eager, realized it was time for him to step up.<br>
                           <br>
Determined to make a difference, Benny set out on a journey through the meadow, his wings fluttering with anticipation. The sun bathed the landscape in warmth as Benny soared through the air, weaving between flowers and dancing with the gentle breeze. He knew he had to find a solution to the nectar predicament, not just for himself but for the entire hive.<br>
                           <br>
As Benny explored, he encountered various flowers, each telling a story of the meadow's biodiversity. With each delicate landing, he learned about the essential role bees played in pollination, connecting the intricate web of life in the ecosystem.<br>
                           <br>
His journey continued, leading him to a field of vibrant flowers. Benny's heart raced with excitement as he discovered a bountiful source of nectar. The challenge was clear – bring this newfound treasure back to the hive and save the swarm from the impending scarcity.<br>
                           <br>
With newfound purpose, Benny soared back to the hive, ready to share his discovery. Little did he know, this was only the beginning of his adventures, and the meadow held more challenges and lessons for him to uncover.<br>

                              </em></strong>Benny buzzed back to the hive, his wings flickering with energy as he carried the news of the vibrant flower field. The hive, wrapped in a worried hum, eagerly gathered around Benny, their multifaceted eyes reflecting a glimmer of hope.<br>
                           <br>
In the heart of the hive, Benny unfolded his plan. &quot;I've found a field of flowers brimming with nectar, just beyond the edge of the meadow,&quot; he exclaimed, his antennae twitching with excitement. &quot;But we must act swiftly to secure this new source.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
The swarm, initially hesitant, was captivated by Benny's enthusiasm. With a collective hum of agreement, they prepared to embark on a journey to the unexplored field. As the swarm took flight, Benny led the way, guided by the scent of the blooming flowers.<br>
                           <br>
Descending upon the field, the bees marveled at the vibrant colors and sweet fragrance. Benny, with his keen sense of smell, guided them to the richest blossoms, demonstrating how to extract nectar efficiently. In the process, young bees learned about the importance of nectar collection for honey production and the hive's sustenance.<br>
                           <br>
Yet, the nectar dilemma presented its own challenges. Some flowers held their golden treasure deeper within, requiring a different technique. Benny showcased the intricate dance of the honeybee, a figure-eight pattern known as the &quot;waggle dance,&quot; signaling the direction and distance to the best nectar sources.<br>
                           <br>
As the swarm harmonized their movements, the meadow transformed into a lively spectacle of buzzing cooperation. Benny's lessons transcended the mere act of gathering nectar; they became a symphony of unity, showcasing the interdependence of each bee within the hive.<br>
                           <br>
The young bees, inspired by Benny's leadership, began to grasp the significance of their role in maintaining the delicate balance of the meadow. Through teamwork and the discovery of the new flower field, Benny not only addressed the immediate nectar shortage but also sowed the seeds of knowledge among his fellow bees.<br>
                           <br>
The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the exhausted yet satisfied swarm. Benny, with a humble buzz, acknowledged that their journey had just begun. Little did they know, the challenges of the meadow were yet to unfold, and Benny's educational odyssey would continue to shape the destiny of the buzzing community.<br>

                              </em></strong>As the days passed in the meadow, Benny's reputation as an adventurous bee grew. One morning, as sunlight filtered through the petals, Benny noticed a ripple of concern spreading through the hive. The challenge this time wasn't the scarcity of nectar but a need to communicate the location of the newfound flower field to the entire swarm.<br>
                           <br>
Perched on a sunlit petal, Benny contemplated a solution. He recalled stories from the elder bees about the legendary &quot;waggle dance.&quot; With newfound determination, Benny decided to teach the swarm this intricate dance of communication.<br>
                           <br>
In the heart of the hive, Benny gathered the bees around him. &quot;Listen closely,&quot; he hummed, demonstrating the elegant figure-eight movements that characterized the waggle dance. Each swish of his body conveyed a message, indicating both the direction and distance to the flower field.<br>
                           <br>
The swarm watched, mesmerized by Benny's graceful dance. The young bees, eager to learn, mimicked his movements, creating a synchronized spectacle within the hive. Through repetition and observation, Benny's dance became a language, a means for bees to share vital information.<br>
                           <br>
Benny's dance class extended beyond the hive walls. The meadow buzzed with bees communicating through intricate waggles, transforming the once-silent landscape into a vibrant dance floor. Children observing this part of the tale would grasp the importance of communication in the bee world and understand how these tiny creatures convey complex information to their fellow hive members.<br>
                           <br>
With the waggle dance mastered, the swarm became a tightly-knit community, capable of coordinating their efforts efficiently. Benny's educational journey continued, weaving lessons not just about the challenges of the meadow but also the ingenuity and adaptability of the bee community. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the hive pulsed with a newfound unity, setting the stage for the next chapter in Benny's adventurous tale.<br>

                              </em></strong>One sunny afternoon, as the bees set out for the flower field, a fluttering challenge awaited them. A friendly butterfly, adorned with delicate hues, flitted into their path, eager to lend a helping wing. Benny, always the perceptive bee, realized the potential for confusion.<br>
                           <br>
The butterfly, with good intentions, began to mimic the waggle dance, creating a dance of its own with loops and twirls. The swarm, initially amused, soon found themselves in a buzz of chaos. Benny, recognizing the need to maintain order, approached the butterfly with a gentle hum.<br>
                           <br>
&quot;Thank you for your kindness, dear butterfly,&quot; Benny expressed, &quot;but our dances are unique to us bees. Let me show you how we communicate.&quot; Benny demonstrated the precise figure-eight waggle dance, explaining its significance in guiding the swarm to the flower field.<br>
                           <br>
The butterfly, gracious and understanding, fluttered away, leaving the bees to resume their journey. This encounter became a valuable lesson for the young bees about the differences between bees and butterflies. Benny emphasized the importance of recognizing and respecting diversity in the meadow, teaching children about the various pollinators and their distinct roles in the ecosystem.<br>
                           <br>
As the swarm continued on their path, Benny's leadership shone brighter. The meadow, a tapestry of colors and life, unfolded before them. The encounter with the butterfly became a memorable chapter in Benny's adventures, showcasing not only the challenges of the meadow but also the harmony achievable when creatures of different wings work together. And so, Benny led his fellow bees forward, ready to face the mysteries that awaited them in the enchanting world beyond the hive.<br>

                           <br>
Benny, undeterred by the inclement weather, rallied the bees together. &quot;In times of rain, we must work as a unified hive to protect our precious nectar and our home,&quot; he proclaimed with determination. With that, Benny led the swarm in creating a protective shield over the hive entrance using their bodies, showcasing the bees' remarkable ability to adapt to changing weather.<br>
                           <br>

                        <span style="line-height:17px;"><span style="color:#000000;"/>In the heart of Termite Forest, nestled among towering trees and glistening dewdrops, there existed a remarkable clan known as the Royal Architects. Led by their wise and regal Queen, this termite society thrived on purposeful collaboration, each member contributing to the intricacies of their colossal mound. The Royal Architects were not just ordinary termites; they were extraordinary builders, and their mound stood as a testament to their collective genius.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;"></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;">Within the depths of the royal chamber, the Queen resided, a majestic figure overseeing the bustling activity of her loyal subjects. Her primary role was to lay the eggs that would give birth to the future architects of the colony. The Queen, adorned in shades of royal purple, exuded an aura of wisdom and responsibility. Her subjects, the worker and soldier termites, eagerly awaited her guidance, for she held the key to the continuation of their society.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;"></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;">Surrounding the Queen, the worker termites scurried tirelessly, their small but industrious bodies weaving through intricate tunnels and chambers within the mound. They were the backbone of the colony, diligently constructing and expanding their grand architectural marvel. Each worker knew their role, from foraging for building materials to meticulously crafting new chambers for future generations. The Queen's chamber, a masterpiece of design, was a testament to their unwavering commitment to their royal duties.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;"></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;">Soldier termites, with their formidable jaws and sturdy exoskeletons, stood guard at the entrances to the mound. Their duty was to protect the colony from potential threats, be it rival termite clans or other forest inhabitants seeking to plunder their resources. The soldiers, disciplined and vigilant, represented the first line of defense in the intricate tapestry of termite life.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;"></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;">As the Queen continued to lay eggs, the anticipation among the termites grew.

                        <span style="line-height:17px;">The Queen's chamber, once a hub of bustling activity, now echoed with a solemn silence. As the workers exchanged worried glances, a courageous worker named Harmony stepped forward. Harmony, known for their soothing vibrations that kept the colony connected, suggested a temporary solution – distributing the Queen's responsibilities among the most experienced workers until she recovered.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;"></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;">With a collective nod of agreement, the termites devised a plan. The duties of egg-laying, decision-making, and communication fell upon a select group of workers, each chosen for their exceptional skills.

The Queen, though still ailing, observed the resilience of her subjects from her chamber. Witnessing the workers stepping into uncharted territories, she felt a swell of pride. It became evident that the legacy of the Queen's leadership wasn't solely about her individual rule but the collective strength of the Royal Architects.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:17px;">One sunny day, a sudden torrential rainstorm swept through Termite Forest, posing a grave threat to the meticulously constructed mound. The workers scurried in panic as water seeped into the chambers, and the once-sturdy tunnels became vulnerable. Buzz, with their keen sense of responsibility, emerged as a beacon of hope.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:17px;">The challenge was clear – the workers needed to protect their home from flooding. Buzz rallied a group of fellow workers, and together they devised a plan to divert the water away from the mound. Armed with mud pellets and tiny rocks, the worker termites set out to construct intricate tunnels and channels, working tirelessly to reroute the rainwater.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;"></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:17px;">As the rain continued to pour, Buzz and the team faced setbacks and challenges.

                           <br>
Fear started taking over. I was walking into my first school in Georgetown, Guyana. I had travelled a long distance in order to join my<br>
mother, who had been here for three years, with the hopes of a brighter future in Guyana. My father decided that I would be better off going to school here, so I was enrolled at Flying Wings Academy in Mukobeko. I was afraid of how I would do. I didn’t know anybody in my class. With anxiety on one hand and fear on the other, I reached for the doorknob, opening it slowly. Everyone’s eyes were on me as I entered the room.<br>
                           <br>
Without paying attention to them, I went straight to the teacher and asked if this was the right class. With a soft voice, he answered, “Yes.” His voice comforted me a little. He gave me a sheet called ‘Class Activities’, which I was so grateful for, then he asked me to choose where I would sit. I chose the seat closest to the door instead of the corner where all the boys were sitting.

Fear started taking over. I was walking into my first school in Georgetown, Guyana. I had travelled a long distance in order to join my<br>
mother, who had been here for three years, with the hopes of a brighter future in Guyana. My father decided that I would be better off going to school here, so I was enrolled at Flying Wings Academy in Mukobeko. I was afraid of how I would do. I didn’t know anybody in my class. With anxiety on one hand and fear on the other, I reached for the doorknob, opening it slowly. Everyone’s eyes were on me as I entered the room.<br>
                           <br>
Without paying attention to them, I went straight to the teacher and asked if this was the right class. With a soft voice, he answered, “Yes.” His voice comforted me a little. He gave me a sheet called ‘Class Activities’, which I was so grateful for, then he asked me to choose where I would sit. I chose the seat closest to the door instead of the corner where all the boys were sitting. I didn’t actually want to pick a seat since in my previous school we had our own seats; and never needed to worry about that. I spent the rest of the morning grouping living and non-living things and preparing a web for our composition. Since it was my first day, I was confused as to which corridor to use when visiting the washroom, but my class teacher asked the prefect to accompany me. <br>

Paul and his mom want to do something unusual tomorrow. Let’s take a short vacation. After a long discussion, they decided to go on a breakfast picnic. Paul believed it was an excellent idea. Paul was excited, so he ran to his friends next door and broke the news.<br>
                           <br>
All his friends were happy for him since he seldom goes anywhere. It was foggy when Paul woke up the next morning. For a moment he began to think it would rain. Then, suddenly, at 7 o’clock, the sun broke through the heavy mist and the fog disappeared. A beautiful blue sky quickly replaced the unhappy grey one. Paul and his mom quickly packed the picnic equipment into the car. They drove to the seawall, miles from the city. On their way, they saw lots of families travelling to the beach. Paul became more excited and was anxious to get to their destination.<br>
                           <br>
When they arrived, Paul jumped out of the car and looked around to see if any of his friends were there. The wet grass looked shiny. It smelled as fresh as sunlight. Paul and his mom ate their fruit salad and sandwiches. They each drank a cup of Milo. Then they sat quietly, looking at the scenery. All around them, birds chirped, showing their enjoyment of the lovely day.<br>

Last week Anil Williams and his parents moved from Kabwe to Kitwe. They now live in a small community called Better Hope.<br>
                           <br>
The neighbours there are very friendly. They work together to clean the drains, cut tall weeds, repair community signs and keep the community tidy. The lawns and gardens are always well kept. Listen as Anil tells us about his new community.<br>
                           <br>
“The Singhs are my neighbours on the right. There are four children in that family, two boys and two girls. My neighbours on the left are the Jackmans. They have two children, Mel and David. Mel is seven years old and David is nine. I am also nine years old.<br>
                           <br>
The most exciting time for me is being able to visit the community playground. The playground has swings, slides, tunnels, monkey bars, a see-saw and lots of space to run and play. There is a pavilion on the playground where members of the community meet and discuss problems affecting them.<br>
                           <br>
I also enjoy the quiet atmosphere of the community. My new neighbours often play their radios and television very quietly, not to affect us. They know that we have a newborn baby. I am very excited about my new community and my new neighbours.”<br>

It was the August vacation, and the weather was really hot. Yeshua’s mother had told him that on Saturday they would be going to the creek. Yeshua was excited. He couldn’t wait to try out the swimming skills he had learnt at the swimming club during the year.<br>
                           <br>
His father had to work, so he was not going to be able to go with him. The drive to the creek was about an hour long, but to Yeshua it seemed like forever. Mother said they would spend the day swimming and having a big treat of eating dinner at their favourite restaurant. This would end their busy day.<br>
                           <br>
They finally arrived at the beach. Yeshua helped his mother unload the beach blankets, his sand toys, and some snacks. “The water looks really refreshing!” Yeshua said to his mother. Mother found a suitable spot on the sand that was close to the water. She put the blankets down and set up some chairs. Sitting close by them was a boy looking the same age as Yeshua. He came over<br>
and said his name was Gary and asked Yeshua if he wanted to build a sandcastle with him. “Sure,” said Yeshua. His mother began talking to Yeshua’s mother about school, work, and things mothers would usually talk about.<br>
                           <br>
After the boys had finished building a great sandcastle, they decided to head for the water. “Be careful,” shouted Gary’s mother. “We will,” Gary shouted. The boys were running in and out of the water and laughing while the waves rose. They were having a great time. Suddenly, they jumped into a big wave and Yeshua couldn’t find Gary. Yeshua looked all around and finally saw him waving his hands, yelling for help.<br>
                           <br>
Yeshua sprang into the water and remembered the lifesaving skills he learned during his swimming class at the local pool. “I’ve got to get to Gary,” shouted Yeshua. Yeshua swam to where Gary was and put his arm around him and told him to hold onto him. Just then, the lifeguard spotted them.<br>
                           <br>
He rushed to the water and took over. He was able to get Gary from Yeshua and bring both of them safely back to shore. Gary’s mother was scared, but she realized if it hadn’t been for Yeshua’s quick action, Gary may have drowned.<br>

The Hindu Festival<br>
of Diwali is here again.<br>
It is a national holiday in<br>
November. All the villagers<br>
become very busy preparing for the night when<br>
the entire village would glow with lights of all<br>
kinds. Preparation starts weeks before Diwali.<br>
Diyas are bought or made, houses are scrubbed<br>
and cleaned to welcome the goddess, Lakshmi<br>
who believes that Hindus should be clean, not<br>
only in body, but in thought, word and deed.<br>
Let Us Read<br>
19<br>
Lucas and his sister Arya are always excited<br>
about Diwali. Lucas helps his father to make the<br>
stand on which they set the diyas. This stand is<br>
made from bamboo. Cleaning of the walls of the<br>
house and polishing of the floor and furniture<br>
are done by Arya and Lucas.<br>
When the big day arrives, Lucas’ mother, Priya,<br>
prepares food and all kinds of sweetmeats. These<br>
sweetmeats are served to relatives and friends<br>
who come to greet the family. The children are<br>
always excited and can’t wait to light the diyas.<br>
From very early in the day, oil is poured into<br>
vessels and wicks are placed in each.<br>
Later in the evening, the family says prayers and<br>
begins to light diyas one at a time. This act of<br>
lighting diyas together brings the family closer<br>
together. This is truly a time when the warmth<br>
of Diwali is felt.<br>
You could also see the joy on the faces of the<br>
villagers as they watch the flickering lights of<br>
the lighted diyas which are arranged in beautiful<br>
designs.<br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">When Sandy awoke</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">early one morning, she</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">did not see her brother,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Mark in his room. She went</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">downstairs and saw him putting decorations</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">around the verandah. “What are you doing?”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">asked Sandy. “Christmas will be here soon,” said</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Mark. Sandy went to the kitchen for breakfast.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Mother, father and Gabi were very busy.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">“What’s Christmas?” asked Sandy.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">“It’s a wonderful time of the year when people</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">celebrate the birth of Christ,” said mother. While</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Sandy ate her breakfast, mother wrapped the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">gifts. She told Sandy that Christmas is a time for</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">giving. “Is it Christmas yet?” Sandy asked. “Soon,”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">said mother, smiling.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Gabi was hanging stockings from the mantel. She</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">showed Sandy hers. “Is it Christmas yet?” asked</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Sandy. “Not yet,” said her sister, smiling. That</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">afternoon Sandy went outside on the varendah.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">She saw father fixing the Christmas tree.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">He said, “You can help me to carry it in the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">house.” “Then will it be Christmas?” asked</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Sandy. “Well, soon,” said father, smiling. Father</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">and Sandy took the tree into the house.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Brother decorated it with fairy lights and other</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">decorations. Mother was hanging a wreath on</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the front door. “Is Christmas here now?” asked</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Sandy. “Well, not quite,” said Mother. Inside the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">house, Mark and Gabi were baking special</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">cookies. Sandy reached for one. “No!” said</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Mark, “They are for Christmas.” “When will</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Christmas be?” asked Sandy. “Oh! Very soon,” he</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">said. Father turned on the lights on the trees</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">with the gifts, stockings and decorations. It</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">was the most beautiful sight I had ever seen.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Day of course! Students of</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the Zambia Technical Institute</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">had a chance to show how best they can</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">celebrate Valentine’s Day. Ms. Fanfair, the Vice</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Principal of the Zambia Technical Institute,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">wanted the Art students to do something rather</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">special for the people living at the Palms.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The students decided to organise the largest</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Valentine activity in town. Two students drew a</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">big heart outline on a piece of hard cardboard.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">It was five feet wide and six feet long. Some</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">students painted the heart red, while others</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">used thread to sew a lacey border around the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">edge. Making the heart was fun for them. When</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">it was time to deliver the heart, the students</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">had trouble trying to put the heart into Ms.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Fanfair’s vehicle. “It wouldn’t fit,” said Carlos. The</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Narish shouted. &quot;Man,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">you couldn't hit your way out</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">of a paper bag.&quot; Barnwell dropped the bat. No</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't hit</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the ball. It just wasn't fair. All his life he had</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">loved the game of cricket, more than anyone</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">had, but every time he got up to bat, he got</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">nervous. Why did he keep trying to play?</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">One day, as Barnwell rode down the street he</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">saw as usual, all the boys playing in Mr. Singh’s</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">backyard. When he reached the game, he got</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">off his bike. One boy noticed him. “Should we let</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the ‘wiffer’ bat?” Narish asked. “Why not,” Billy</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">shouted. He walked over and handed Barnwell</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the bat. Barnwell felt sweat dripping down his</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">sides. He stepped on his right foot and swung</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the bat as hard as he could. He heard a loud pop</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">as the ball hit the bat and it soared into the sky.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">patted him on his back and gave him high fives.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">That evening, after making a total of twenty–five</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">runs, Barnwell was declared the most valuable</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">backyard player on the street. For the first time</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">in his life, Barnwell felt proud to be a cricketer.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">last Easter and was torn. As usual, Lu planned to</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">more than just fly his kites around the park by</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">himself. Lu decided this year he was going to take</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The first-place prize would be $50,000.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Lu told his mother</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">what he was</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">planning to do</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">on Sunday, and</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">she thought it</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">was a good idea.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Let Us Read</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">49</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">“My only thought is that I don’t know how</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">much wind will be blowing on Sunday,” said his</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">mother. “The weather will be very hot,” his</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">mother added. “That’s okay,” said Lu. “I have a</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">feeling it’s going to be a good day, and I will</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">win the contest.” Sunday came and Lu woke up</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">very early. The contest was scheduled to start</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">at 10:00 h, and he didn’t want to be late. When</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">he got to the park with his two kites, he was</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">surprised to see there were close to twenty or</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">twenty-five kids there for the same contest.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">“Wow!”, he thought to himself, “I don’t know if</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">I’ll have a chance.” Lu went to the sign-in table</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">and entered his two kites in the contest. He</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">brought his blue and red box kite and the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">other was the butterfly kite. The contest</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">began, and Lu was watching his box kite fly</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">high into the air. The</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">kite was up in the air</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">for fifteen minutes,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">but suddenly it fell to</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the ground and Lu was</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">out of that competition.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">He then entered his butterfly kite. Lu was next</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">to a boy who had a homemade kite with pieces</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">of string for its tail. His kite was flying close to</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Lu’s. Suddenly, it touched Lu’s kite and moved</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">higher above the butterfly kite.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Lu knew he could have won if the boy’s kite</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">didn’t touch his, but Lu felt sorry for the boy,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">and let the homemade kite get above his kite.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The judge declared the boy with the homemade</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">kite the winner.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Lu congratulated him and said, “That was a</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">great kite you flew.” The boy said he made the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">kite himself using some leftover materials his</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">dad had and tied some old rags to make the tail.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The boy was so happy he won the prize of</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">$50,000. He told Lu he was going to buy a real</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Saturday was going</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">to be a special day for</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Arya. It was her birthday.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">No one had said anything</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">about her birthday so far, and it was already</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Thursday. “I‘m certain they have all forgotten</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">it’s my birthday,” Arya thought to herself. When</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Arya went to school the very next day, she</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">told her friend, Penny, that her birthday was</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">on Saturday. “I know,” said Penny. “Finn told all</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the children about your birthday.” “Awesome, I</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">didn’t realize everyone knew,” Arya exclaimed.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Saturday finally came and Arya whisked down</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the stairs. “Good Morning,” said mother. “Hello,”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">said Arya with excitement in her voice.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">She looked around but</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">couldn’t see anything that</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">would let her know that</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">anyone was going to make a</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">fuss about her birthday.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">“What are you doing today?” asked her</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">mother. “Not sure yet Mother, I guess I might</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">just hang around the house,” said Arya, feeling</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">a bit disappointed. She didn’t want to have to</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">tell her mother that it was her birthday. “Why</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">don’t you come with me to the Ptolemy Reid</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Centre?” asked mother. “Why? What will I do</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">there?” replied Arya. “They need some help</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">with a few children there,” mother replied. “Oh</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">well!” said Arya, “That might be fun after all.”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">That afternoon Arya and her mother went to</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the Children’s Home. As the door swung open,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">lots of people, children and Arya’s friends</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">yelled, “SURPRISE!” Arya couldn’t believe it.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">59</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">There were all her friends from school, along</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">with members of her family. She saw Uncle Jack,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Aunty May, and many cousins, along with</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Grandma Flo and Grandpa Joe. White, red, and</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">blue balloons hung from the ceiling with a huge</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">banner saying, “Happy Birthday Arya!” There was</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">a colourful and large cake sitting on the table</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">along with many, many presents wrapped in</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">special birthday paper and with big shiny bows.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The music began to play. All of Arya’s</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">favourite songs were the first to be played. Her</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">friends danced and danced until perspiration ran</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">down their faces. Arya was called to stick her</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">birthday cake. She felt so special. “This is the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">best birthday I’ve ever had!” said Arya. “Thank</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">you everyone for making this day the best ever.”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Her friend, Penny, said to her, “Did you really</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">think we would forget your birthday? We had</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">this planned for a month.” Arya felt overjoyed</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">and grateful to her family and friends. She got</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">up in front of everyone and said, “Thank you all,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">for such a special birthday. I love you all.”</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">He explained to Farah the process of extraction.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The injection hurt just a bit, then her mouth</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">felt numb. Soon after, Dr. Bowman cleaned out</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the cavity and filled the tooth. The dentist</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">showed Farah some pictures.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The pictures showed her how to keep her teeth</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">healthy and strong. He also gave her a hamper</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">with a toothbrush, toothpaste and some mouth</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">wash. Farah liked Dr. Bowman. She promised to</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">tell her friends that they must visit the dentist</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">if they wanted to keep strong and healthy</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">teeth. The next day, Farah told her friends that</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Dr. Bowman is the best dentist ever and they</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">should visit him whenever they wanted to do an</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Youth Week is a special week in which the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">achievements, skills and talents of our Guyanese</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">youths are celebrated. During “Youth Week”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">several activities such as drama, parties, debates,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">rallies and clean up exercises are planned. These</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">activities help to develop the minds of the youths,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">as well as, the environment in which they live.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">This year, Latiefa’s class teacher took her hardworking</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">children to visit the Kaieteur Falls in</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Region Eight.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Ms. Persaud had encouraged her class to work</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">hard and improve their grades, and they did. The</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">entire class had been involved in keeping the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">school environment clean and they had even</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">planted flower plants around the schoolyard. At</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the end of the tour, Ms. Persaud reminded the</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">children that youths must educate themselves by</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">working hard and studying their school work. She</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">reminded them that success comes through hard</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">work. The children thanked their teacher for a</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">wonderful week of activities and promised to</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">continue to study and be respectful to their</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">She will make a great wife and mother. She’s so</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">nice. Your dad and I both love her.” James met</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Paula after she broke her leg. She broke her leg</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">dancing. James was the doctor who looked after</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">her leg. He visited her every day at the hospital.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Then, he visited her at home. He brought her get</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">well cards and gifts. They fell in love with each</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">other. “I never thought a broken leg would be a</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">good thing,” Paula told her mother. “But it was</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the best thing that ever happened to you. Life is</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">strange sometimes,” her mother said.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">After Paula’s leg healed,</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">she and James started</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">dating. They went to movies</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">and restaurants. They went to</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">the gardens.</span><br>

The children of<br>
Grade Three took<br>
their seats quickly and<br>
quietly in the school hall.<br>
In walked the judges and sat in front of the large<br>
stage. Everyone was filled with excitement. Then,<br>
suddenly, a voice said over the microphone, &quot;We<br>
will begin the Song Festival with the school choirs<br>
singing a well-known piece, 'O’ Melda. School<br>
choirs, please get ready.”<br>

Let Us Read<br>

Eight schools took part in the Song Festival.<br>
The children walked onto the stage one behind<br>
the other and waited for the signal before<br>
they began to sing. Their parents, friends and<br>
teachers cheered loudly as they completed<br>
their song and bowed.<br>
The audience enjoyed the 'solo singing' the<br>
most. Each child sang 'The Market Sellers' and<br>
'My Native Land'. Someone said the judges<br>
would have a difficult time choosing the<br>
winners. Suddenly, the audience became quiet.<br>
A tall man walked towards the microphone and<br>
called for attention. He was the Chief Judge.<br>
He gave the results. Everyone clapped when he<br>
was finished speaking<br>
because they agreed<br>
with the decision.<br>
It was an exciting<br>
experience for the<br>
children of Grade<br>
Three on their final<br>
day in that class.<br>
It was the best Song<br>
Festival ever.<br>

Fear started taking over. I was walking into my first school in Georgetown, Guyana. I had travelled a long distance in order to join my<br>
mother, who had been here for three years, with the hopes of a brighter future in Guyana. My father decided that I would be better off going to school here, so I was enrolled at Flying Wings Academy in Mukobeko. I was afraid of how I would do. I didn’t know anybody in my class. With anxiety on one hand and fear on the other, I reached for the doorknob, opening it slowly. Everyone’s eyes were on me as I entered the room.<br>
                           <br>
Without paying attention to them, I went straight to the teacher and asked if this was the right class. With a soft voice, he answered, “Yes.” His voice comforted me a little. He gave me a sheet called ‘Class Activities’, which I was so grateful for, then he asked me to choose where I would sit. I chose the seat closest to the door instead of the corner where all the boys were sitting. I didn’t actually want to pick a seat since in my previous school we had our own seats; and never needed to worry about that. I spent the rest of the morning grouping living and non-living things and preparing a web for our composition. Since it was my first day, I was confused as to which corridor to use when visiting the washroom, but my class teacher asked the prefect to accompany me. <br>
                           <br>
The bell rang for lunch and the prefect introduced me to several boys and girls and we ate lunch together. At the end of the day, I was in the schoolyard when I spotted my bus. I was thinking that today wasn’t so bad after all. As the days passed, I had developed some friendships and started to love my school. I found out that Kabwe has many opportunities, but not everyone was using them. Some people take them for granted. I think I am going to enjoy it at my new school.<br>
