                                                      <strong>4 Correctly and safely string a bow.</strong><br>
There are three basic ways of stringing and unstringing a bow. Two of them are safe, and one<br>
is not. The unsafe method is also presented because it is very commonly practiced. It is presented here so that you can recognize when another person is using it, and by so doing, placing himself at risk. If you see someone using this method, please educate them.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>1. Bow Stringer</strong><br>
A bowstringer is a device that makes it safe and easy to string a<br>
bow. The archer steps on the bow stringer and then pulls the bow<br>
upward causing it to flex. This brings the tips of the bow closer<br>
together, and the string can then be looped over the string notch.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>2. Step through</strong><br>
The &quot;Push Pull&quot; method<br>
Checking the String<br>
Armguard<br>
In this method; the archer begins by placing one end of the string into the string notch on the lower limb of the bow. The archer then &quot;steps into&quot; the bow by placing the right leg between the bow and the string, locking the bottom limb of the bow around the right calf and foot. The bow's belly should be to the archer's left, and the bottom tip should rest against the left side of the archer's right foot. The outside of the right knee will then be in a position to brace the bow near its handle. As the right hand is used to flex the bow and the left hand is used to loop the string around the upper string notch. This method can damage your bow if done incorrectly.<br>
This is the least favored way of the 3 stringing options.<br>
                                                      <br>
Push Pull<br>
Though the push pull method of stringing is safe for your bow<br>
and has been popularized for that reason, it is very dangerous to<br>
the archer since, as you can see in the photo, the top limb is<br>
directly aligned with your head, and any slip while using this<br>
method can result in permanent eye damage and even death,<br>
especially from recurve bows since the back of a recurved limb<br>
creates a point which acts as a force multiplier. Children should<br>
never be taught this method of stringing a bow and even<br>
experienced professional bow technicians have been injured<br>
through its use . We present the method here so that if you see<br>
someone using it, you can educate them. Do not use this method<br>
to string a bow.<br>
                                                      <br>
The bow is placed as shown in the picture. The bottom &quot;bow nock&quot; will be up against the instep of the shoe. By pushing with the palm of the top hand and pulling with the bottom hand the bow is bent. The fingers of the top hand pluck the string on or off.<br>
                                                      <br>
Always Check the String<br>
When you have strung the bow, turn it away from you 180<br>
degrees to check the string. That way if the string slips off, the<br>
bow will kick out away from you. Whichever method for stringing<br>
a bow is selected, it is important to check <em>both </em>ends of the bow<br>
to ensure that is has been strung properly. Do this whether you<br>
have strung it yourself or if someone else has strung it for you.<br>
The string on an improperly strung bow can come off when the<br>
bow is drawn, potentially causing injury.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>5 Describe and show how to use the following:<br>
                                                      </strong><br>
5a Arm guard<br>
Hitting your arm is one of the unpleasantries of archery. You can protect yourself with an armguard while learning how not to hit your arm. A leather or plastic armguard with elastic bands should be placed on the inside of your forearm just below your elbow. If you have a slight hyperextension to your elbow you can purchase a long armguard which will cover the inside of your entire bow arm.<br>
                                                      <br>
5b Finger tab or glove<br>
[1]<br>
Finger tab<br>
The purpose of a finger tab or glove is to<br>
protect the archer's finger from the string.<br>
There are several types of finger tabs<br>
available. The &quot;Marshall&quot; style has one hole<br>
and the &quot;Western&quot; style has two holes. Either<br>
one works fine. They should be trimmed to fit the archer.<br>
The &quot;archers glove&quot; covers the finger tips and secures around the archer's wrist.<br>
                                                      <br>
5c Quiver<br>
A quiver by definition is &quot;anything that holds arrows&quot;. There are several types of quivers<br>
including:<br>
The side quiver which hangs from a belt<br>
The back quiver which hangs from the shoulder.<br>
The side quiver which hooks onto a pocket.<br>
The pocket quiver.<br>
The ground quiver which sits on the ground.<br>
                                                      <br>
5d Bow sling<br>
The purpose of a bow sling is to keep you from dropping your bow. There are two types<br>
of bow slings: the wrist sling and the finger sling.<br>
A wrist sling is a strap that is connected to your bow for you to put your hand through<br>
while gripping your bow.<br>
A finger sling is a 2 inch string with a loop at each end. After gripping your bow the<br>
loops go over the thumb and your index finger.<br>
                                                      <br>
5e String kisser<br>
The string &quot;kisser&quot; is a point on the string that touches your lip or corner of your mouth.<br>
If you are using a &quot;center draw&quot; (see, Anchor) the string is in the middle or your chin and<br>
the middle of your nose. A &quot;kisser&quot; would be a small disc on the string that would touch<br>
your lip. This assures a vertical alignment of your bow.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>6 Demonstrate the following shooting techniques:<br>
                                                      </strong><br>
6a The stance<br>
The stance is the position the feet and body assume when addressing the target.<br>
Setting your feet is the first step in setting up a good shot. A good foundation is<br>
important in anything, especially in archery.<br>
Proper archery stance<br>
First, lay an arrow pointing toward your<br>
target and perpendicular to the shooting<br>
line. Second, place your feet straddling the<br>
shooting line with your toes slightly touching<br>
the arrow.<br>
Your feet should be placed approximately<br>
the same distance apart as your shoulders<br>
as a starting point. Once you find a<br>
comfortable stance it is important to<br>
remember where to put your feet each time<br>
you return to the shooting line.<br>
6b Nocking the arrow<br>
To place an arrow on the bowstring. The attachment to the rear of an arrow which is<br>
placed on the bowstring and holds the arrow on the string.<br>
There are two ways to put and arrow on the string. One is right and one is wrong. The<br>
index feather or &quot;cock&quot; feather should point away from the bow. This feather is usually<br>
a different color than the other two which are also known as &quot;hen&quot; feathers. Doing this<br>
allows the hen feathers to gracefully clear the bow. If the &quot;index&quot; feather is pointed<br>
toward the bow it will kick out away from the bow as it tries to clear the bow during the<br>
shot.<br>
The picture shows the most common way of placing the fingers on the string. The<br>
thumb and small finger should not be involved in the shot in any way or fashion. They<br>
should be relaxed and folded down as if you were saying &quot;I'm THREE years old&quot;.<br>
After nocking the arrow, place three fingers on the string. Two under the arrow and 1<br>
over the arrow then slide them together, lightly touching the arrow. The string should be<br>
at the first joint near the end of your fingers. This is a starting point. Competitive<br>
archers try to get the string at the very end of their fingers for a quicker release but this<br>
takes years of training.<br>
6c The draw<br>
This is the act of pulling the string back. The archer should start with the bow arm<br>
pointed directly at the target before pulling the string. Some young archers like to pull<br>
the string while raising their bows but this is a waste of energy and creates fatigue<br>
while shooting. Be very deliberate with little wasted motion.<br>
6d The anchor<br>
The &quot;anchor&quot; is a combination of points to which the bowstring and/or the index finger<br>
of the drawing hand are drawn to on the face and neck. There are multiple ways of<br>
&quot;Anchoring&quot; the string after you have drawn the bow. Here are two of the most common<br>
ones.<br>
The Side Draw<br>
The Center Draw<br>
Hold and Aim<br>
The Release<br>
The Side Draw: Hunter or Field Style - Pull<br>
the string back so the index finger of your<br>
string hand touches the corner of your<br>
mouth. This places the arrow directly<br>
beneath the eye that you are aiming with.<br>
This is recommended for all beginners. As archers continue to progress and put an<br>
aiming device on their bow they can progress to the next one.<br>
The Center Draw: Target or Olympic Style - Pull the string hand under your jaw so the<br>
string is in the middle and in front of the chin. The string should also touch the nose.<br>
The string hand is in line with and directly under the jaw bone.<br>
Remember that anchoring in the same place and the same way every time is critical no<br>
matter how you choose to anchor.<br>
6e The hold and aim<br>
To superimpose a sight pin on the center of a target or, when not<br>
using a sight, the placement of the tip of the arrow on a particular<br>
point for a given distance.<br>
Hold means to get everything locked into place and be sure that<br>
you are ready to release the arrow. There should be a straight line<br>
from the back elbow right through the arrow to the back of the bow<br>
(see photo).<br>
Aim is the process of deciding when to let go of the string. An archer without a sight<br>
uses an &quot;instinctive&quot; method or guessing how high or low to aim.<br>
A sight is a reference point for aiming but is only useful if the archers shoots the same<br>
way every time.<br>
An archer without a sight can use a sighting method called &quot;point of aim&quot;.<br>
6f The release<br>
The release is the act of allowing the string<br>
to leave the fingers.<br>
The release is the most important part of<br>
the shot. It is when everything comes<br>
together in a fraction of a second. The best<br>
way to perform the release is to just relax<br>
the fingers. As the arrow goes toward the<br>
target, the string hand should go in exactly<br>
the opposite direction.<br>
Follow-through<br>
[Expand]<br>
6g The follow-through<br>
&quot;Follow through&quot; refers to the<br>
movement of the drawing<br>
hand and arm after the<br>
release.<br>
Once the archer has released<br>
the arrow, nothing should<br>
move. The archer must give<br>
the arrow time to clear the<br>
bow. To insure this, instruct<br>
your archers to wait until the<br>
arrow hits the target before<br>
moving at all. In the picture you can see that my release hand goes in the exact<br>
opposite direction as the arrow. Making sure that your shoulders don't collapse is very<br>
important. Also, notice that I am still aiming, long after the arrow is gone.<br>
7 Why is it necessary to have an arrow &quot;nocking point&quot; properly positioned on the bow<br>
string?<br>
If the nocking point is too high, the arrow will be pointed &quot;down&quot; and come out of the bow low.<br>
If the nocking point is too low, the arrow will be pointed &quot;up&quot; and come out of the bow high.<br>
Nock rings can be placed on the bow to allow for consistency. A bow square and nock pliers<br>
can be used to set the nocking point properly.<br>
8 Using a standard (Olympic bow) score one of the following:<br>
a. Indoors: 30 arrows (5 rounds) at 18 meters score 50 points on a 60 cm target.<br>
b. Outdoors: 30 arrows (5 rounds) at 25 meters score 170 points on a 122 cm<br>
target.<br>

More Information<br>
A standard &quot;Olympic Bow&quot; is a recurve (not compound) bow with no more than 3 stabilizer<br>
extensions, a sight, and a clicker. An archer must use fingers and not a mechanical release<br>
and may not have a string peep sight or magnified aiming device.<br>

Don't shoot straight up.<br>
Never run on the archery range.<br>
Approach the target from the side, not the front so you don't get poked by the arrows<br>
sticking out of the target.<br>
Be sure your equipment is in good working order.<br>
Be aware of who is around you at all times.<br>
Don't &quot;hide&quot; behind the target.<br>
Don't walk in front of another archer.<br>

Bats are in the order Chiroptera, which literally means &quot;hand-wing&quot; in Latin. This name makes<br>
sense because a bat's wings stretch over the forearm and fingers, and attach down at the<br>
ankle bones. The name is from the Greek, Cheir=hand; Pteron=wing. They got this name when<br>
scientists noticed that they fly with a modified hand.<br>

Largest: The biggest flying mammals are the Flying Foxes, particularly those living in Asia<br>
and Australia. Several species have a length of 45 cm (17.7 in), a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft<br>
7 in), and a weight of 1.6 kg (3.5 lb). The Indian Flying Fox in particular has been known to<br>
attain a wingspan of 6 feet.<br>
Smallest: The world's smallest bat is the Kitti's Hog-Nosed Bat (a.k.a. The Bumblebee<br>
Bat) of Thailand. Weighing less than a penny and with a wingspan of less than 5 inches it<br>
is also the worlds smallest mammal.<br>

There are approximately 1000 species of bats in the world, and bats live on every continent<br>
except Antarctica. There are approximately 825 species of Micro-chiroptera worldwide, and<br>
about 175 species of Mega-chiroptera.<br>

a. Mega-chiroptera<br>
b. Micro-chiroptera<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">7 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Which suborder of bats uses echolocation and which suborder uses eyesight to find<br>
their food?<br>
a. Megabats: Use eyesight.<br>
b. Microbats: Use echolocation. (Bats send out sound waves using their mouth or nose.<br>
When the sound hits an object an echo comes back. The bat can identify an object by the<br>
sound of the echo. They can even tell the size, shape and texture of a tiny insect from its<br>
echo. Most bats use echolocation to navigate in the dark and find food.)<br>

The microbats are generally insect-eating, although they tend to have a much more varied diet<br>
than the megabats. Besides Insects, microbats eat anything from nectar and fruit like<br>
megabats, fish, small mammals and birds, and even blood.<br>

Most bats have one baby per year, though some have twins or triplets. Baby bats are called<br>
pups.<br>

600 - 1,000 insects per hour according to their body weight. A single brown bat can eat 1,200<br>
insects per hour.<br>

a. Eat insects. A single brown bat can eat 1,200 insects per hour (3,000 - 7,000 per night).<br>
Bats eat such harmful insects such as cockroaches, mosquitoes, and gnats. Large<br>
colonies of bats can consume many insects that would otherwise harm farmers' crops.<br>
b. Pollinate and spread seeds. Bats serve as food plant pollinators.<br>
c. Provide outlet for medical research. Their echolocation skills have been studied to help<br>
medical professionals help the blind. A chemical agent in the saliva of the common<br>
vampire bat, Draculin, is being tested for use in helping stroke victims.<br>

You can find online plans to build your own bat house </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">here</span><span style="color:#212529;">.<br>

For best results, the roosting chamber should be at least 50 cm (20 in) wide, 70 cm (24 in)<br>
high, and about 2 cm (3/4 in) deep on the inside. It should have an open bottom and a roof.<br>
The inside should be roughened with horizontal saw cuts or lined with a plastic mesh so the<br>
bats will have something to grab on to. Do not make the bat box from pressure-treated wood,<br>
but do use outdoor grade plywood or cedar. A roof will certainly help preserve the bat box,<br>
especially if covered with asphalt shingle or with metal. Caulk the box to prevent drafts since<br>
bats, like you, like a draft-free home. Painting your box an appropriate color increases<br>
success. Lighter colors in hot climates and dark or black in cooler areas. You might<br>
experiment with different colors on boxes to see what the bats like.<br>
It should ideally be mounted on a building where it can more readily absorb heat, or on a pole.<br>
Mounting a bat box in a tree will ensure that no bats move in. The bat box should be mounted<br>
away from trees and utility wires where bat predators (hawks, owls, etc.) may roost. The bat<br>
box should be at least 12 feet from the ground.<br>
3 months is a very short time for observation because it may take several years to attract<br>
bats. Batcon.org regularly updates its guide to bat houses based on volunteer research (which<br>
you can help with). The design, finishing, and placement of the bat box will determine the<br>

house and the amount of sun make a big difference. Research shows multiple boxes near<br>
each other will greatly increase your success rate. Placing bat boxes in an area that already<br>
has bats (especially that are using a building) will help. Consider contacting pest control<br>
companies to find a building owner that wants to exclude bats and set up your bat boxes as<br>
an alternative. The location is already proven and you will be providing needed homes for the<br>
bats. Properly placed bat houses can find success in almost all climates.<br>
Once you have bats in the box, you can check the box by shining a flashlight inside from the<br>
bottom. If you attract pups, you can see them after the mothers leave in the evening. You can<br>
also count the bats as they depart at dusk.<br>
Attracting bats with bat houses provides several benefits. You increase biodiversity while<br>
keeping bats out of buildings where they can damage the structure. Bats eat insects and<br>
reduced insects will make your backyard more enjoyable. Batcon.org has some great case<br>
studies of organic farmers who have used bats to combat crop-destroying insect pests.<br>
The effort to put up the bat box and monitor it is the most time-consuming part of this honor.<br>
The Advanced Honor is well worth doing because it covers additional interesting bat facts.<br>

The best way to keep these items clean is by cleaning them <em>often</em>. As soon as something is<br>
spilled on the stovetop, in the microwave, or in the fridge, it is a <em>lot </em>easier to clean <em>now </em>than it<br>
will be later when the spilled item hardens.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Under what conditions do germs and pests thrive? Give ways of cleaning each of<br>
the following: basement, closets, cupboards, sinks, floors, and toilets.<br>
Germs and pests love filth, and that is the primary reason for keeping things clean. Germs and<br>
pests carry and spread disease, so keeping the house clean will also help keep its occupants<br>
healthy.<br>
Basement<br>
Basements should be swept frequently and kept as dry as possible. If the basement is prone<br>
to wetness, it should not be carpeted and nothing should be stored on the floor. Rather,<br>
everything should be placed on top of pallets or shelves so that the dampness cannot get into<br>
the items stored and cause them to mold. A wet basement should be treated for mold and<br>
mildew.<br>
If possible, find the source of the wetness and have it repaired.<br>
Closets<br>
Closets should be kept neat and orderly. Closet organizers, shoe racks, and shelves are<br>
excellent aids in this endeavor. It's a good idea to air out the closet occasionally, and the floors<br>
should be swept or vacuumed whenever the house is cleaned.<br>
Cupboards<br>
Cupboards should be periodically emptied and wiped down. If the shelves are lined with shelf<br>
paper, the paper can be changed every now and then to freshen the look of the cupboards.<br>
Sinks<br>
Sinks should be cleaned frequently. This can be done with dish soap and a sponge or a wash<br>
cloth. Stainless steel sinks can be scrubbed with steel wool. If the sink has a garbage<br>
disposal, the rubber gasket around the drain should be removed and cleaned frequently too<br>
(they get pretty gross). Run citrus peels through the disposal to freshen it up.<br>
Floors<br>
Hardwood, tile, or linoleum floors should be swept and mopped. Carpeted floors should be<br>
vacuumed frequently and steam cleaned every now and then.<br>
Toilets<br>
Toilets should be scrubbed on the inside with a toilet brush. Especially important is the area<br>
just under the rim. A toilet cleaner should be used to do this. The seat, rim, and lid also need<br>
to be wiped down with a general-purpose cleaner, as does the outside of the bowl and the<br>
tank.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5 </span><span style="color:#212529;">State the proper way to prepare dishes for washing, either in the sink or<br>
dishwasher. State the order in which silver, glass, table, and kitchen dishes<br>
should be washed.<br>
Scrape all leftover food into a garbage disposal or into the trash. Dishes with tough, stuck-on<br>
food may need to be soaked before it can be cleaned. Oatmeal becomes almost cement-like if<br>
it hardens in the bowl or pot, so soaking is almost absolutely a requirement. This is true<br>
whether the dish will be hand washed or machine washed.<br>
Modern dishwashers do not require that the dish be rinsed before running it through the cycle<br>
- the dishwasher will rinse them at least as well as you will. If washing them by hand, it is a<br>
good idea to rinse them off first so that you do not spoil the water. It is difficult to get anything<br>
clean with dirty water! Once the dishes are prepared for washing, they should be stacked.<br>
Glasses should be washed first, followed by silverware, table dishes, and finally kitchen<br>
dishes. In general, the order is to wash the cleanest items first, saving the dirtiest items for<br>
last. Glasses are difficult to get clean unless the dishwater is grease-free, so that is the reason<br>
they should be done first even if they are more dirty than the silver or table dishes. Keep an<br>
eye on the dishwater - if it becomes disgusting, change it!<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">How should rugs, carpets, pillows, upholstered furniture, papered walls, painted<br>
walls, floors, and windows be cleaned?<br>
Rugs<br>
Rugs can be taken outside and shaken out, or even hung over a line and beaten. Keep shaking<br>
or beating the rug until dirt stops coming out.<br>
Carpets<br>
Carpets should be vacuumed frequently and steam-cleaned every now and then. If something<br>
is spilled on a carpet, it should be cleaned up right away. The best way to do this is by placing<br>
an absorbent material (dish towel, wash cloth, or paper towel) over the spill and pressing. As it<br>
absorbs the spill, move a dry area of the towel over the spill and continue until it no longer<br>
comes up wet. Some spills should be treated with an upholstery/carpet cleaner immediately<br>
after this or the carpet will be permanently stained (juices) or bleached (vomit).<br>
Pillows<br>
Pillows usually have an outer covering that can be removed and machine washed. Let the<br>
padded portion of the pillow air out while the cover is laundered.<br>
Upholstered furniture<br>
Furniture upholstered with cloth can (and should) be vacuumed whenever the carpets are<br>
vacuumed. Remove the cushions and vacuum the undersides, as well as the portion of the<br>
furniture underneath them. They can also be touched up with an upholstery cleaner. Follow<br>
the directions on the bottle.<br>
Furniture upholstered with leather can be wiped down with a damp cloth, and should be<br>
cleaned occasionally with a leather cleaner. Be sure that the leather cleaner you choose is for<br>
furniture, or you may end up with stains on your clothing.<br>
Papered walls<br>
Papered walls should be cleaned with a slightly dampened cloth. Be careful not to get the<br>
paper too wet or it may peel off.<br>
Painted walls<br>
Painted walls are more durable than papered walls, so they can be scrubbed down with soapy<br>
water. Glossy finishes clean easier than satin or flat finishes, so when choosing a paint, keep<br>
that in mind. A bathroom, kitchen, or small child's room might be better served with a glossy<br>
finish. A ceiling or master bedroom can be painted with a flat paint (if desired).<br>
Floors<br>
Hardwood, tile, and linoleum floors should be swept frequently and mopped occasionally.<br>
Always sweep right before mopping. To mop a floor, fill a mop bucket half way with warm or<br>
hot water, and add a floor cleaner to it. Submerge the mop under the water, pull it up, wring it<br>
out, and then pass it over the floor, &quot;painting&quot; the entire surface of the floor. Plan out where<br>
you will mop so that you do not have to walk over the damp floor. It is best to do this chore<br>
when small children are outside, not home, or asleep, as they sometimes have difficulty<br>
understanding that they should not walk on a wet floor.<br>
Windows<br>
Windows should be washed with window cleaner or with a mixture of vinegar and water. Spray<br>
the cleaner on the glass, and then wipe it off, being careful to not leave streaks. When<br>
washing both sides of the glass, make the last pass horizontally on the inside and vertically<br>
on the outside (or vice versa) so that you can tell which side of the glass a streak is on.<br>

This Answer Book cannot know how trash is disposed of in <em>your </em>community. You will need to<br>
check with your local government for that information. Waste is most commonly placed in a<br>
landfill or incinerated. Some communities require that waste be sorted - yard waste,<br>
recyclables, construction waste, household waste, and toxic waste are all treated differently.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8 </span><span style="color:#212529;">What precautions should be taken in cleaning out a fireplace?<br>
The main danger to be concerned with when cleaning out a fireplace is that of starting an<br>
accidental fire. Be sure the ash contains no embers by waiting until no fire has been burning<br>
for at least 12 hours. Cover the ashes with damp newspaper to keep the dust down, then<br>
shovel the ash into a bag, seal and take the bag outside. You may wish to wear a dust mask<br>
when doing this, and you may wish to cover the hearth with a tarp to contain the mess. Do not<br>
douse a fire in a fireplace with water except in an emergency, as this can cause the firebox to<br>
crack. It will also cause the ash to harden and stick to the brick, making it difficult to clean.<br>
Be sure to have the chimney cleaned by a professional annually so that soot and creosote do<br>
not build up - this is a fire hazard.<br>

Babies have ways of making their own danger. A house that is &quot;baby safe&quot; has been examined<br>
and actions taken to prevent a baby from endangering itself (or others). Unused outlets are<br>
covered so that the baby cannot insert paper clips, coins, or other conductive items into them.<br>
Cleaners, poisons, and other toxic items are stored out of the baby's reach or locked where<br>
they are inaccessible. Stairways are gated so the baby cannot fall down (or climb up and <em>then</em><br>
fall down). Items smaller than a golf ball should also be stored out of a baby's reach, as these<br>
are choking hazards. Babies explore the world with their mouths, so they may try to &quot;eat&quot;<br>
anything that they can fit into their mouths.<br>

different orders. All pictures should be in focus, close-ups and properly<br>
labeled, showing where photographed, the date photographed, common<br>
names and genus or species level names.<br>
Photographing insects can be challenging, but with a few tips, success is within reach.<br>
Perhaps the most important feature of your camera for insect photography is the<br>
&quot;macro mode.&quot; This feature allows the camera to focus on subjects less than 50cm<br>
away. It is often marked on the camera body with a small flower icon (since flower<br>
photography is also mostly close-up). If you cannot find how to enable this feature on<br>
your camera, consult the user's manual. If you cannot find that, search for one on the<br>
Internet.<br>
Once you find an insect, you may discover that it moves far too quickly for you to be<br>
able to take a decent picture. One trick you can use in this case is to capture the insect<br>
and pop it in a refrigerator for about an hour. This will not harm the insect, but it will<br>
certainly slow it down. After taking a few pictures, release the insect into the wild<br>
again.<br>
You can also try placing the insect in a drinking glass, and covering the top with the<br>
camera lens and body. Use a transparent glass for this so that light can illuminate the<br>
insect. Once it settles down, take the picture.<br>
This requirement can really be divided into two phases: field work, and lab work. The<br>
field work comes first, and it consists of going out into the wild and finding as many<br>
insects as you can. Do not worry about identifying them. Photograph as many as you<br>
can. If they are too difficult to photograph, capture them and bring them back to the<br>
&quot;lab&quot; where you can refrigerate them as described previously. The &quot;lab work&quot; is when<br>
you sit down and attempt to identify the insects you have captured, either<br>
photographically, or physically.<br>
We present a crude identification guide below, but if you want to identify the insects<br>
you <em>find</em>, you will very likely need a good field guide. You can try various on-line<br>
identification aids as well, including </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Bug Guide</span><span style="color:#212529;">.<br>
Hymenoptera<br>
Apis<br>
Honey Bee (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Apis</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Hymenoptera<br>
Where found: Worldwide<br>
Description: Honey bees (or honeybees) are a subset of bees which represent a far<br>
smaller fraction of bee diversity than most people suspect; of the approximately 20,000<br>
known species of bees, there are only seven presently-recognized species with a total<br>
of 44 subspecies (Engel, 1999; historically, anywhere from six to eleven species have<br>
been recognized). These bees are the only living members of the tribe Apini, all in the<br>
genus Apis, and all of which produce and store liquified sugar (&quot;honey&quot;) to some<br>
degree, and construct colonial nests out of wax secreted by the workers in the colony.<br>
Other types of related bee produce and store honey, but only members of the genus<br>
Apis are considered true honey bees.<br>
Odonata<br>
Anax junius<br>
Green Darner (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Anax junius</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Odonata<br>
Where found: North America<br>
Description: is one of the biggest and fastest-flying dragonflies, able to reach speeds<br>
of 85 km/h (55 mph). This species has several nicknames, including &quot;Darning Needle&quot;<br>
for its speed, &quot;Mosquito Hawk&quot; for its predatory habits, and &quot;Lord of June&quot; for its<br>
abundance during the summer season. It is also Washington State's state insect.<br>
Libellula lydia<br>
Common Whitetail (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Libellula lydia</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Common Whitetail or Long-tailed Skimmer is a common dragonfly<br>
across much of North America.<br>
Description: The male's chunky white body (about 5 cm long), combined with the<br>
brownish-black bands on its otherwise translucent wings, give it a checkered look.<br>
Females have a brown body, and are less noticeable, though they have a similar wing<br>
pattern. The Common Whitetail can be seen hawking for mosquitoes and other small<br>
flying insects over ponds, marshes, and slow-moving rivers in most regions except the<br>
higher mountain regions.<br>
Orthoptera<br>
Romalea guttata<br>
Eastern lubber grasshopper (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Romalea guttata</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Found in the southeastern and south central portion of the United States.<br>
Description: The Eastern lubber grasshopper is the most distinctive grasshopper<br>
species within the southeastern United States, and is well known both for its size and<br>
its unique coloration.<br>
Phasmatodea<br>
Phasmatodea<br>
Walking Sticks (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Phasmatodea</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Phasmatodea<br>
Description: The Phasmatodea are an order of insects, whose members are variously<br>
known as stick insects (in Europe), walking sticks (in the United States of America),<br>
ghost insects and leaf insects (generally the family Phyliidae). The ordinal name is<br>
derived from the Greek &quot;phasma&quot; meaning an apparition or phantom, and refers to the<br>
resemblance of many species to sticks or leaves. Some species (e.g. Anisomorpha)<br>
are capable of secreting a substance from glands on the metathorax that can cause an<br>
intense burning irritation of the eyes (and in some cases temporary blindness) and<br>
mouth of potential predators on contact.<br>
Blattodea<br>
Blattodea<br>
Cockroach (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Blattodea</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Blattodea<br>
Description: Cockroaches (or simply &quot;roaches&quot;) are insects of the order Blattodea. This<br>
name derives from the Latin word for &quot;cockroach&quot;, blatta. Among the most well-known<br>
species are the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, which is about 30 mm (1<br>
inch) long, the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, about 15 mm (1/2 inch) long,<br>
the Asian cockroach, Blattella asahinai, also about 15 mm (1/2 inch) in length, and the<br>
Oriental cockroach, Blatta orientalis, about 25 mm (3/4 inch). Tropical cockroaches are<br>
often much bigger, and extinct cockroach relatives such as the Carboniferous<br>
Archimylacris and the Permian Apthoroblattina were several times as large as these.<br>
Cockroaches are generally considered pests; however, only about 30 species (less than<br>
1%) infest urban habitats.<br>
Isoptera<br>
Isoptera<br>
Termite (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Isoptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Isoptera<br>
Description: Termites mostly feed on dead plant material, generally in the form of<br>
wood, leaf litter, soil, or animal dung, and about 10% of the estimated 4,000 species<br>
(about 2,600 taxonomically known) are economically significant as pests that can<br>
cause serious structural damage to buildings, crops or plantation forests. Termites are<br>
major detrivores, particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions, and their recycling<br>
of wood and other plant matter is of considerable ecological importance. As social<br>
insects, termites live in colonies that, at maturity, number from several hundred to<br>
several million individuals. They are a prime example of decentralised, self-organised<br>
systems using swarm intelligence and use this cooperation to exploit food sources and<br>
environments that could not be available to any single insect acting alone. A typical<br>
colony contains nymphs (semi-mature young), workers, soldiers, and reproductive<br>
individuals of both genders, sometimes containing several egg-laying queens.<br>
Mantodea<br>
Mantodea<br>
Mantis (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Mantodea</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Mantodea<br>
Description: Mantises are notable for their hunting abilities. They are exclusively<br>
predatory, and their diet usually consists of living insects, including flies and aphids;<br>
larger species have been known to prey on small lizards, frogs, birds, snakes, and even<br>
rodents. Most mantises are ambush predators, waiting for prey to stray too near. The<br>
mantis then lashes out at remarkable speed. Some ground and bark species, however,<br>
pursue their prey rather quickly. Prey are caught and held securely with grasping, spiked<br>
forelegs (&quot;raptorial legs&quot;); the first thoracic segment, the prothorax, is commonly<br>
elongated and flexibly articulated, allowing for greater range of movement of the front<br>
limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.<br>
Psocoptera<br>
Psocoptera<br>
Booklice (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Psocoptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Psocoptera<br>
Description: Psocoptera are an order of insects that are commonly known as booklice,<br>
barklice or barkflies. They range in size from 1–10mm in length. The species known as<br>
booklice received their common name because they are commonly found amongst old<br>
books — they feed upon the paste used in binding. The barklice are found harmlessly<br>
on trees, feeding on algae and lichen.<br>
Thysanoptera<br>
Thysanoptera<br>
Thrips (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Thysanoptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Description: Thrips (Order Thysanoptera) are tiny, slender insects with fringed wings<br>
(thus the scientific name, from the Greek thysanos (fringe) + pteron (wing)). Other<br>
common names for thrips include thunderflies, thunderbugs, storm flies, and corn lice.<br>
Thrips species feed on a large variety of sources both plant and animal by puncturing<br>
them and sucking up the contents. A large number of thrips species are considered<br>
pests, because they feed on plants with commercial value. Some species of thrips feed<br>
on other insects or mites and are considered beneficial, while some feed on fungal<br>
spores or pollen. So far around 5,000 species have been described. Thrips are generally<br>
tiny (1 mm long or less) and are not good flyers, although they can be carried long<br>
distances by the wind. In the right conditions, many species can explode in population<br>
and swarm everywhere, making them an irritation to humans.<br>
Phthiraptera<br>
Phthiraptera<br>
Lice (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Phthiraptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Phthiraptera<br>
Description: As lice spend their whole life on the host they have developed adaptations<br>
which enable them to maintain close contact with the host. These adaptations are<br>
reflected in their size (0.5–8 mm), stout legs, and claws which are adapted to cling<br>
tightly to hair, fur and feathers, and that they are wingless and flattened. Lice feed on<br>
skin (epidermal) debris, feather parts, sebaceous secretions and blood. A louse's color<br>
varies from pale beige to dark grey; however, if feeding on blood, it may become<br>
considerably darker. A louse egg is commonly called a nit. Lice attach their eggs to<br>
their host's hair with specialized saliva which results in a bond that is very difficult to<br>
separate without specialized products. Living lice eggs tend to be pale white. Dead lice<br>
eggs are orangeish.<br>
Coleoptera<br>
Coleoptera<br>
Beetles (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Coleoptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Coleoptera<br>
Description: Beetles are a group of insects which have the largest number of species.<br>
They are placed in the order Coleoptera, which means &quot;sheathed wing&quot; and contains<br>
more described species than in any other order in the animal kingdom, constituting<br>
about twenty-five percent of all known life-forms. Forty percent of all described insect<br>
species are beetles (about 350,000 species), and new species are frequently<br>
discovered. Estimates put the total number of species, described and undescribed, at<br>
between 5 and 8 million. Beetles can be found in almost all habitats, but are not known<br>
to occur in the sea or in the polar regions. They interact with their ecosystems in<br>
several ways. They often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris,<br>
and eat other invertebrates. Some species are prey of various animals including birds<br>
and mammals. Certain species are agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato<br>
beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata, the boll weevil Anthonomus grandis, the red flour<br>
beetle Tribolium castaneum, and the mungbean or cowpea beetle Callosobruchus<br>
maculatus, while other species of beetles are important controls of agricultural pests.<br>
For example, coccinellidae (&quot;ladybirds&quot; or &quot;ladybugs&quot;) consume aphids, scale insects,<br>
thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.<br>
Strepsiptera<br>
Strepsiptera<br>
Twisted-winged Parasites (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Strepsiptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Strepsiptera<br>
Description: The Strepsiptera (known in older literature as <em>twisted-winged parasites</em>)<br>
are an order of parasitic insects with nine families making up about 600 species. Their<br>
hosts include bees, wasps, leafhoppers, silverfish, and cockroaches. Male Strepsiptera<br>
have wings, legs, eyes, and antennae, and look like flies, though they generally have no<br>
useful mouthparts. Females, in all families except the Mengenillidae, never leave their<br>
host and lack wings and legs. Males have a very short adult lifetime (usually less than<br>
five hours) and do not feed as adults. Many of their mouth parts are modified into<br>
sensory structures.<br>
Raphidioptera<br>
Raphidioptera<br>
Snakefly (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Raphidioptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Raphidioptera<br>
Description: Raphidioptera are characterized by having an elongate prothorax but no<br>
modification of the forelegs (as in Mantispidae). Females typically have a long<br>
ovipositor. The two extant families of snakeflies are the Raphidiidae and Inocelliidae.<br>
They are all predatory, both as adults and larvae, and in North America occur<br>
exclusively in the Western United States, but also occur throughout temperate Europe<br>
and Asia. They can be quite common.<br>
Megaloptera<br>
Megaloptera<br>
Alderflies, Dobsonflies, and Fishflies (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Megaloptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Megaloptera Megaloptera, from the Greek words <em>mega</em>, meaning large, and<br>
                                                      <em>ptera</em>, meaning wing, undergo the most rudimentary form of complete metamorphosis<br>
among the insects (there are fewer differences between the larval and adult forms of<br>
Megaloptera than in any other order of insects), and their aquatic larvae dwell in fresh<br>
water, around which the adults also live. Females lay their eggs in large masses on<br>
vegetation that is proximate to water. The larvae are carnivorous, possessing strong<br>
jaws that they use to capture other aquatic insects. They grow slowly, taking several<br>
years to reach the last larval stage. When they reach maturity, the larvae crawl out onto<br>
land to pupate in damp soil or under logs. The short-lived adults emerge later to mate -<br>
many species never feed as adults, living only a few days or hours. The most wellknown of the Megaloptera is probably the dobsonfly, in which males have tusk-like<br>
mandibles - but while formidable in appearance, they are relatively harmless to<br>
humans, as well as all other organisms. These huge mandibles, much like a peacock's<br>
feathers, serve no purpose other than to attract mates. Hellgrammites, which are<br>
dobsonfly larvae, are often used for bait. There are about 300 known species.<br>
Neuroptera<br>
Neuroptera<br>
Net-winged insects (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Neuroptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Neuroptera<br>
Description: The insect order Neuroptera, or net-winged insects, includes the<br>
lacewings, mantidflies, antlions, and their relatives. The adults of this order possess<br>
four membranous wings, with the forewings and hindwings about the same size, and<br>
with many veins. They have chewing mouthparts, and undergo complete<br>
metamorphosis. The larvae of most families are predators. Many chrysopids eat<br>
aphids and other pest insects, and have been used for biological control (either from<br>
commercial distributors but also abundant and widespread in nature). Larvae in<br>
various families cover themselves in debris (sometimes including dead prey insects)<br>
as camouflage, taken to an extreme in the ant lions, which bury themselves completely<br>
out of sight and ambush prey from &quot;pits&quot; in the soil. Larvae of some Ithonidae are root<br>
feeders, and larvae of Sisyridae are aquatic, and feed on freshwater sponges. A few<br>
mantispids are parasites of spider egg sacs. As in other orders, there is a pupal stage,<br>
generally enclosed in some form of cocoon composed of silk and soil or other debris.<br>
Adults of many groups are also predatory, but some do not feed, or consume only<br>
nectar.<br>
Mecoptera<br>
Mecoptera<br>
Scorpionflies (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Mecoptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Mecoptera<br>
Description: Mecoptera (from the Greek: <em>meco- </em>= &quot;long&quot;, <em>ptera- </em>= &quot;wings&quot;) are an order<br>
of insects with about 550 species in nine families worldwide. The Bittacidae, or<br>
hangingflies, are a prominent family of elongate insects known for their elaborate<br>
mating rituals, in which females choose mates based on the quality of gift prey offered<br>
by various males.<br>
Siphonaptera<br>
Siphonaptera<br>
Flea (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Siphonaptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Siphonaptera<br>
Description: Fleas are external parasites, living off the blood of mammals and birds.<br>
Fleas are small (1/16 to 1/8-inch (1.5 to 3.3 mm) long), agile, usually dark colored (for<br>
example, the reddish-brown of the cat flea), wingless insects with tube-like mouthparts<br>
adapted to feeding on the blood of their hosts. Their bodies are flattened side to side,<br>
permitting easy movement through the hairs or feathers on the host's body. Their legs<br>
are long, the hind pair well adapted for jumping (vertically up to seven inches (18 cm);<br>
horizontally thirteen inches (33 cm) - around 200 times their own body length, making<br>
the flea the best jumper out of all animals (in comparison to body size). The flea body<br>
is hard, polished, and covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward,<br>
allowing the flea a smooth passage through the hairs of its host. Fleas attack a wide<br>
variety of warm-blooded vertebrates including dogs, cats, humans, chickens, rabbits,<br>
squirrels, rats and mice. Fleas are a nuisance to their hosts, causing an itching<br>
sensation which in turn may result in the host attempting to remove the pest by biting,<br>
pecking, scratching etc the vicinity of the parasite. Fleas are not simply a source of<br>
annoyance, however. Some people and animals suffer allergic reactions to flea saliva<br>
resulting in rashes. Flea bites generally result in the formation of a slightly-raised<br>
swollen itching spot with a single puncture point at the center. The bites often appear<br>
in clusters or lines, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks<br>
afterwards. Fleas can also lead to hair loss as a result of frequent scratching and biting<br>
by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases. Besides the problems posed by<br>
the creature itself, fleas can also act as a vector for disease. For example, fleas<br>
transmitted the bubonic plague between rodents and humans by carrying <em>Yersinia</em><br>
                                                      <em>pestis </em>bacteria.<br>
Diptera<br>
Diptera<br>
Flies (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Diptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Diptera<br>
Description: The presence of a single pair of wings distinguishes true flies from other<br>
insects with &quot;fly&quot; in their name, such as mayflies, dragonflies, damselflies, butterflies,<br>
etc. It is a large order, containing an estimated 240,000 species of mosquitoes, gnats,<br>
midges and others, although under half of these (about 120,000 species) have been<br>
described. It is one of the major insect orders both in terms of ecological and human<br>
(medical and economic) importance. The Diptera, in particular the mosquitoes<br>
(Culicidae), are of great importance as disease transmitters, acting as vectors for<br>
malaria, dengue, West Nile virus, yellow fever and other infectious diseases.<br>
Lepidoptera<br>
Lepidoptera<br>
Butterflies, Moths and Skippers (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Lepidoptera</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Order: Lepidoptera<br>
Description: Lepidopterans undergo complete metamorphosis, going through a fourstage life cycle:<br>
1. egg<br>
2. larva/caterpillar<br>
3. pupa/chrysalis<br>
4. imago/adult<br>
The larvae, caterpillars, have a toughened head capsule, chewing mouthparts, and a<br>
soft body, that may have hair-like or other projections, 3 pairs of true legs, and<br>
additional prolegs (up to 5 pairs). Adults have two pairs of membranous wings covered,<br>
usually completely, by minute scales. In some species, wings are reduced or absent<br>
(often in the female but not the male). Antennae are prominent. In moths, males<br>
frequently have more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female<br>
pheromones at a distance.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2 </span><span style="color:#212529;">What are the distinguishing characteristics of an insect?<br>
Insects possess segmented bodies supported by an exoskeleton, a hard outer covering made<br>
mostly of chitin. The body is divided into a head, a thorax, and an abdomen. The head<br>
supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and mouth parts. The thorax<br>
has six legs (one pair per segment) and wings (if present in the species). The abdomen<br>
(made up of eleven segments some of which may be reduced or fused) has respiratory,<br>
excretory and reproductive structures.<br>

Many insects are considered pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include<br>
those that are parasitic (mosquitoes, lice, bedbugs), transmit diseases (mosquitos, flies),<br>
damage structures (termites), or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many<br>
entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, often using insecticides, but more<br>
and more relying on methods of biocontrol.<br>

Although pest insects attract the most attention, many insects are beneficial to the<br>
environment and to humans. Some pollinate flowering plants (for example wasps, bees,<br>
butterflies, ants). The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade<br>
established relationships between China and the rest of the world. Fly larvae (maggots) were<br>
formerly used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene, as they would only consume dead<br>
flesh. This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Adult insects such as<br>
crickets, and insect larvae of various kinds are also commonly used as fishing bait.<br>

Draft Horses<br>
Draft horses are recognizable by their tall stature and extremely muscular build. In general,<br>
they tend to have a more upright shoulder, producing more upright movement and<br>
conformation that is well-suited for pulling. They tend to have short backs with very<br>
powerful hindquarters, again best suited for the purpose of pulling. Additionally, the draft<br>
breeds usually have heavy bone, and a good deal of feathering on their lower legs. Many<br>
have a straight profile or &quot;Roman nose&quot; (a convex profile). Draft breeds range from<br>
approximately 16 hands high to 19hh and from 1,400 to 2,000 lbs.<br>
Light Horses<br>
Light riding horses such as Arabians, Morgans, or Quarter Horses usually range in height<br>
from 14.0 (142 cm) to 16.0 hands (163 cm) and can weigh from 386 kilograms to about<br>
540 kg (850 to 1200 lb). Larger riding horses such as Thoroughbreds, American<br>
Saddlebreds or Warmbloods usually start at about 15.2 hands (157 cm) and often are as<br>
tall as 17 hands (172 cm), weighing from 500 kg to 680 kg (1100 lb to 1500 lb).<br>

Percheron<br>
The Percheron is a breed of powerful rugged draft horses that originated in the Perche<br>
valley in northern France.<br>
Percherons are noted for heavy muscling and for an aspect of ruggedness and power.<br>
Also characteristic of the Percheron is clean action and quality conformation of the<br>
feet and legs. The mane is thick, though the tail is usually cut short. The breed is close<br>
coupled, wide and deep through the chest, with plenty of back rib. The muscles of the<br>
forearms, croup and gaskins are especially emphasized in a good drafter, and ease and<br>
balance of gait is essential. The horse is also expected to be of good temperament and<br>
be an easy keeper.<br>
The Percheron head and neck is typical of the correct draft horse. Good Percherons<br>
have a large and full prominent eye, a broad and full forehead, and straight face. A wide<br>
jaw and refined ears attractively set and carried with animation are visible evidence of<br>
the Percheron's Arabian ancestry.<br>
The Percheron has a very pleasing disposition, and is proud, alert, and intelligent. They<br>
are generally very gentle horses, well-suited for driving, and are strong and willing<br>
workers. They have the strength to pull heavy loads and the graceful style to pull a fine<br>
carriage. Percherons can be ridden and some have even been trained to jump.<br>
Percherons range in height from 15 to 19 hands high, most are between 16-2 and 17-3<br>
hands high. They can weigh up to 2,600 pounds with the average around 1,900.<br>
Percherons are generally black or gray.<br>

Belgian draft horse from the Maryland State Fair<br>
Belgian<br>
The Belgian has a small head, thick and muscular neck, powerful shoulders and<br>
quarters, short legs with small amount of feathering. Chestnut or red roan in color, they<br>
can stand up to 17 hh (1.7 m).<br>
On average the Belgian will grow to be slightly over 1 ton or 2,000 pounds. Colors<br>
normally are a type of light chestnut with a flaxen mane. They are considered a draft<br>
horse. Historically their main use was as a farm horse. They are still used as working<br>
animals, but have also become popular as show horses, gaming horses, and even as<br>
trail riding horses.<br>
They are able to pull tremendous amounts of weight. At the National Western Stock<br>
Show in Denver, Colorado, a team of two horses in the Heavyweight class pulled 17,000<br>
pounds a distance of 7 ft 2 in (7,700 kg a distance of 2.18 m). The team of Belgians<br>
weighed 4,800 pounds (2,200 kg).<br>

Clydesdale<br>
The Clydesdale is a breed of draft horse derived from the very hard-working farm<br>
horses of Clydesdale, Scotland, and named for that region. Thought to be over 300<br>
years old, the breed was extensively used for pulling heavy loads in rural, industrial and<br>
urban settings, their common use extending into the 1960s when they were a still a<br>
familiar sight pulling the carts of milk and vegetable vendors.<br>
Clydesdales are noted for grace and versatility; they can stand as tall as 18 hands (1.8<br>
meters or 6 feet) in height and up to one ton (2,000 pounds) in weight. A Clydesdale<br>
has a large head with somewhat convex profile, small ears, large, dark eyes and a<br>
heavy forelock. The neck is short and slightly arched, the chest deep, the shoulders<br>
heavy and well-muscled. The back is short, the withers clearly defined, and the rump<br>
presents a well-muscled and distinctively rounded silhouette. The legs should be long<br>
and strong with characteristically large hoof size, being at least twice the diameter of<br>
those of a light riding horse, such as a Thoroughbred.<br>
Clydesdales may be of several possible colors, including various shades of bay<br>
(sometimes called brown), roan, chestnut, and black.<br>
Clydesdales have characteristic long hair, known as <em>feather </em>(not &quot;feathers&quot;), on the<br>
lower legs, falling over the hooves. Generally white, the feather can occasionally be<br>
black or chestnut, depending on the color of the horse and the presence of markings.<br>
Nowadays chiefly for show, this hair was first a result of native stock and breeding with<br>
Flemish horses.<br>
Clydesdales have a range of characteristic white markings which are generally present<br>
regardless of body color. The most distinctive are four white feet and a blaze, most<br>
often a full blaze or large, white &quot;bald face&quot; marking which extends to the lips and chin<br>
and may also extend to the eye region.<br>

Arabian horse<br>
The Arabian horse is a breed of horse with a reputation for intelligence, spirit, and<br>
stamina. With a distinctive head shape and high tail carriage, the Arabian is one of the<br>
most easily recognizable horse breeds in the world.<br>
The Arabian is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please.<br>
Arabian horses have refined, wedge-shaped heads, a broad forehead, large eyes, large<br>
nostrils, and small muzzles. Most display a distinctive concave or &quot;dished&quot; profile.<br>
Another breed characteristic is an arched neck with a large, well-set windpipe set on a<br>
refined, clean throatlatch.<br>
The breed standard for Arabian horses describes the Arabians as standing between<br>
14.1 and 15.1 hands (140-155 cm) tall.<br>
The Arabian Horse Association recognizes purebred horses with the coat colors bay,<br>
gray, chestnut, black, and roan. Bay is the most common color, followed by gray, and<br>
then chestnut. Black is somewhat rare.<br>

Shetland Pony<br>
The Shetland pony is a breed of pony originating in the Shetland Islands. Shetlands<br>
range in size from a minimum height of approximately 28 inches to an official<br>
maximum height of 42 inches (10.2 hands, 107 cm) at the withers. (11.2 hands for<br>
American Shetlands) Shetland ponies have heavy coats, short legs and are considered<br>
quite intelligent. They are a very strong breed of pony, used for riding, driving, and pack<br>
purposes.<br>
Shetland Ponies are hardy and strong, in part because the breed developed in the harsh<br>
conditions of the Shetland Islands. In appearance, Shetlands have a small head,<br>
sometimes with a dished face, wide spaced eyes and small, alert ears. The original<br>
breed has a short, muscular neck, compact, stocky bodies, and short, strong legs and a<br>
shorter than normal cannon bone in relation to their size. A short broad back and deep<br>
girth are universal characteristics as is a springy stride. Shetlands have long thick<br>
manes and tails and a dense double winter coat to withstand harsh weather.<br>
Shetlands can be almost every color, including skewbald and piebald (called <em>pinto </em>in<br>
the United States), but are mainly black, chestnut, bay, brown, gray, palomino, dun, roan,<br>
cremello, and silver dapple.<br>
Shetland ponies are generally gentle, good-tempered, and very intelligent by nature.<br>
They make good children's ponies, but can be very opinionated or &quot;cheeky,&quot; and, if not<br>
handled properly, can be impatient, snappy, and sometimes become uncooperative,<br>
traits often lumped under the label &quot;stubborn&quot; by those who fail to understand that pony<br>
behavior is influenced by the quality of human handling. Due in part to their intelligence<br>
and size, they are easily spoiled and can be very headstrong if not well-trained.<br>

1. Mules are almost always sterile. They are a cross between a male donkey and a female<br>
horse. The sterility is attributed to the different number of chromosomes the two species<br>
have: donkeys have 62 chromosomes, while horses have 64. Their offspring thus have 63<br>
chromosomes which cannot evenly divide.<br>
2. Mules are generally considered to be more intelligent than either horses or donkeys.<br>
3. Its short thick head, long ears, thin limbs, small narrow hooves, short mane, absence of<br>
chestnuts (horny growths) inside the hocks, and tail hairless at the root, make the mule<br>
look like a donkey.<br>
4. Its height and body, shape of neck and croup, uniformity of coat, and teeth, make it look<br>
like a horse.<br>
5. The mule possesses the sobriety, patience, endurance and sure-footedness of the donkey,<br>
and the vigour, strength and courage of the horse.<br>
6. Their hooves are harder than horses, and they show a natural resistance to disease and<br>
insects.<br>
7. They are capable of striking out with any of their hooves in any direction.<br>
Burro<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Identify a burro from a picture or live. Give its size, color, and usefulness.<br>
The Spanish brought donkeys, called &quot;burros&quot; in<br>
Spanish, to North America, where they were prized<br>
for their hardiness in arid country and became the<br>
beast of burden of choice by early prospectors in<br>
the Southwest United States. In the western United<br>
States the word &quot;burro&quot; is often used<br>
interchangeably with the word &quot;donkey&quot; by English<br>
speakers. Sometimes the distinction is made with<br>
smaller donkeys, descended from Mexican stock,<br>
called &quot;burros,&quot; while those descended from stock<br>
imported directly from Europe are called &quot;donkeys.&quot;<br>

beef cattle.<br>
Milk Cattle<br>
Brown Swiss<br>
Brown Swiss is the breed of dairy cattle that produces the second largest quantity of milk per<br>
annum. The milk contains on average 4% butterfat and 3.5% protein, making their milk<br>
excellent for production of cheese. The Brown Swiss is known for their immense size, large<br>
furry ears, and an extremely docile (though some would say lethargic) temperament.<br>
Guernsey<br>
The Guernsey is a breed of cattle used in dairy farming. It is cream and brown in color and is<br>
particularly renowned for the rich flavor of its milk, the very rich yellow color that is richest<br>
color of any milk breed, as well as its hardiness and docile disposition.<br>
Holstein<br>
The primary color pattern for this dairy breed is black and white, but a red and white variety,<br>
called &quot;Red Holstein&quot;, is also maintained. They are the most common breed of milk cow in<br>
America, gives the highest amount of milk yet the lowest butterfat.<br>
Jersey<br>
The Jersey cow is quite small, ranging from only 800 to 1200 pounds (360 to 540 kg), but by<br>
some measures it produces more milk per unit of body weight than any other breed, and has<br>
the highest feed-to-milk conversion efficiency of any dairy breed. The milk is highest of all<br>
breeds for butterfat. Milk is known for the high cream and rich taste. Bulls are also small,<br>
ranging from 1200 to 1800 pounds (540 to 820 kg), and are notoriously aggressive.<br>
Beef Cattle<br>
Angus<br>
Angus cattle are naturally polled (meaning they do not grow horns) and solid black, although<br>
white may appear on the udder. Black Angus are the most popular beef breed of cattle in the<br>
United States.<br>
Brahman<br>
The Brahman has a distinct large hump over the top of the shoulder and neck, and a loose flap<br>
of skin (dewlap) hanging from the neck. Their ears are large and floppy. Bulls weigh 800 to<br>
1100 kgs . Despite their huge size, they are known as a docile breed, if handled with<br>
kindness from calfhood.<br>
Charolais<br>
This breed has been quite popular in the top end of Australia where they are more adaptable<br>
to the harsh weather conditions. The coat is almost pure white.<br>
Hereford<br>
Hereford cattle are a widely-used breed in temperate areas, mainly for beef production.<br>
Originally from Herefordshire, England, they are the most common breed of beef cattle in the<br>
temperate parts of Australia. The breed also enjoys great popularity among ranchers in the<br>
desert American Southwest of the United States and also in the center and east of Argentina.<br>
Texas Longhorn<br>
The Texas longhorn is a breed of cattle known for its characteristic horns, which can extend<br>
to six feet in width and have a slight upward turn at their tips, as well as for their distinctive<br>
burnt orange coloring.<br>

Jersey<br>
Brown Bessie, the famous champion butter cow of the Chicago World's Fair dairy test,<br>
averaged over 40 pounds (18 kg) of milk a day for five months, and made 3 pounds (1.3<br>
kg) of butter a day several times.<br>
Guernsey<br>
Guernsey cows produce around 6000 liters per cow per year, or 16.4 liters (4.3 gallons) per<br>
day.<br>
Holstein<br>
Recorded cows in the USA produced 22,347 pounds (10,158 kg) of milk at 3.64% fat and<br>
3.05% protein.<br>

distinguishing colors of at least three different breeds of goats, such as Saanen,<br>
Toggenburg, Nubian, and British Alpine.<br>
The word <em>milch </em>is German for <em>milk</em>, so one might correctly infer that the milch goat is one that<br>
has been bred for milk production. An angora goat is bred for wool production.<br>
Saanen<br>
Saanen goats are a white breed of goat which are the largest of the dairy breeds. Does<br>
typically weigh 150 lb (68 kg) or more, with bucks weighing over 200 lb (91 kg). The Saanen<br>
breed also produces the most milk (as a breed- there will be good and poor individuals in any<br>
breed) and tends to have a lower butterfat content, about 2.5%-3%. The Saanen temperament<br>
is as a rule, calm and mild mannered; breeders have been know to refer to them as living<br>
marshmallows. Saanen goats are easier for children to handle and are popular in the<br>
showmanship classes due to their calm nature. With solid white coats and pink skin these<br>
extremely mild tempered goats are heavy milkers. They originated from Switzerland.<br>
Toggenburg<br>
The Toggenburg is named after the region in Switzerland where the breed originated, the<br>
Toggenburg valley. Toggenburgs are medium in size, moderate in production, and have<br>
relatively low butterfat content (2-3%) in their milk. The color is solid varying from light fawn to<br>
dark chocolate with no preference for any shade. Distinct white markings are as follows:<br>
white ears with dark spot in middle; two white stripes down the face from above each eye to<br>
the muzzle; hind legs white from hocks to hooves; forelegs white from knees downward with a<br>
dark line (band) below knee acceptable; a white triangle on either side of the tail. Wattles,<br>
small rudimentary nubs of skin located on each side of the neck, are often present in this<br>
breed. The Toggenburg underwent a development program when introduced to Britain - the<br>
resulting British Toggenburg being heavier and having improved milk quality. By the middle of<br>
the year 2002, 4146 Toggenburgs had been registered with the New Zealand Dairy Goat<br>
Breeders Association, representing 8.10% of registered dairy goats. They perform better in<br>
cooler conditions. They are the oldest known dairy breed of goats.<br>
Nubian<br>
The Anglo-Nubian, or simply Nubian in the United States, is a breed of domestic goat<br>
developed in Great Britain of native milking stock and goats from the Middle East and North<br>
Africa. Its distinguishing characteristics include large, pendulous ears and a &quot;Roman&quot; nose.<br>
Due to their Middle-Eastern heritage, Anglo-Nubians can live in very hot climates and have a<br>
longer breeding season than other dairy goats. Considered a dairy or dual-purpose breed,<br>
Anglo- Nubians are known for the high butterfat content of their milk, although on average, the<br>
breed produces less volume of milk than other dairy breeds. Anglo-Nubians are large, with<br>
does weighing around 64 kg. The average height of the breed, measured at the withers, is 81<br>
cm for does and 94 cm for bucks. Like most dairy goats, they are normally kept hornless by<br>
disbudding within approximately two weeks of birth.<br>
British Alpine<br>
The Alpine is a large breed of dairy goat which may have a variety of coat colors. British<br>
Alpines are black with white markings. They are best suited to temperate climates and do not<br>
do well in humid environments. Alpines have erect ears, and multiple coat colors are<br>
acceptable. The Alpines are excellent milkers and can produce milk over an extended period<br>
of time. The Alpine is the second most registered of the dairy breeds. Average milk fat content<br>
for Alpines was 3.5 percent in 2003 and average milk production per doe was 2,083 pounds,<br>
according to national Dairy Herd Improvement statistics.<br>

markings, and general appearance of three breeds of sheep, such as Merino,<br>
Rambouillet, Shropshire, Hampshire, and Lincoln.<br>
Merino<br>
The merino is the most numerous breed of sheep in the world. It is a breed prized for its wool,<br>
although more recently the low price of wool has led to more of an emphasis on its meat.<br>
Super fine merinos are regarded as having the finest and softest wool of any sheep.<br>
Rambouillet<br>
The Rambouillet is also known as the Rambouillet Merino or the French Merino. The fleece<br>
was valuable in the manufacture of cloth, at times being woven in a mixed fabric of cotton<br>
warp and wool weft, known as delaines.<br>
The breed is well known for its wool, but also for its meat, both lamb and mutton. It has been<br>
described as a dual-purpose breed, with superior wool and near-mutton breed characteristics.<br>
Shropshire<br>
The Shropshire breed of sheep originated from the hills of Shropshire, and North<br>
Staffordshire, England, during the 1840's. The breeders in the area used the local horned<br>
black-faced sheep and crossed them with a few breeds of white-faced sheep (Southdown,<br>
Cotswold , and Leicester). This produced a medium sized hornless sheep that produced good<br>
wool and meat.<br>
The breed's adaptability to most environments and their dual-purpose nature led to them<br>
quickly becoming a popular breed.<br>
Today's modern Shropshire isone of the most numerous breeds of sheep (especially in the<br>
mid-west). Its gentle nature and medium size makes it very popular with 4H exhibitors. The<br>
mature weights for Shropshire rams is between 225 to 250 pounds and between 150 to 180<br>
pounds for the females.<br>
Hampshire<br>
The Hampshire is a breed of sheep developed from the Southdowns. The Southdowns had<br>
long had sheep which had dark brown or black legs, matured early, produced the best of<br>
mutton and a fine quality of medium wool. The original Hampshire was larger, coarser, but<br>
hardier, slower to mature, with inferior flesh, and a longer but coarser wool. The Southdown<br>

progeny by other kinds of sheep, and hence it soon impressed its own characteristics on its<br>
progeny by the Hampshire. The horns of the original breed have disappeared; the face and<br>
legs have become dark, the frame has become more compact, the bones smaller, the back<br>
broader and straighter, the legs shorter, and the flesh and wool of better quality, while the<br>
superior hardiness and greater size, as well as the large head and Roman nose of the old<br>
breed, still remain. Hampshires of the 1890s matured early and fattened readily. They clipped<br>
from six to seven pounds of wool, suitable for combing, which was longer than Southdown<br>
wool, but less fine.<br>
The resultant mutton had a desirable proportion of fat and lean, and was juicy and fine<br>
flavored; the lambs were large and were usually dropped early and fed for market.<br>
Lincoln<br>
The Lincoln Longwool is a breed of sheep from England that has been significantly altered by<br>
selective breeding in the later part of the eighteenth century. Cross-breeding with Leicesters<br>
improved the breed's meat production qualities.<br>
The Lincoln Longwool is the largest British sheep, developed specifically to produce the<br>
heaviest, longest and most lustrous fleece of any breed in the world. Great numbers were<br>
exported to many countries to improve the size and wool quality of their native breeds. The<br>
versatile fleece is in great demand for spinning, weaving and many other crafts.<br>
The adult has a body weight of about 60 kg, its fleece can weigh up to 7 kg with a diameter of<br>
about 40 microns and a staple ranging up to 32&quot;.<br>

Tunicate, also known as <em>Urochordata</em>, tunicata (and by the common names of<br>
urochordates, sea squirts, and sea pork) is the subphylum of a group of underwater<br>
saclike filter feeders with incurrent and excurrent siphons, that are members of the<br>
phylum Chordata. Most tunicates feed by filtering sea water through pharyngeal slits,<br>
but some are sub-marine predators such as the <em>Megalodicopia hians</em>.<br>

(Sunburst Anemone)<br>
Sea anemones are a group of water dwelling, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria;<br>
they are named after the anemone, a terrestrial flower. As cnidarians, sea anemones<br>
are closely related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones and Hydra.<br>

(Spiny Chiton)<br>
Chitons live attached to rocks in shallow water. The Chiton feeds mainly on plants of<br>
the sea, removing the plant with its radula (rough tongue). They glide using a massive<br>
foot. Their back is covered with eight heavy armor-like dorsal plates.<br>

(Ecuadorian hermit crab)<br>
Most species of hermit crabs have long soft abdomens which are protected from<br>
predators by the adaptation of carrying around a salvaged empty seashell, into which<br>
the whole crab's body can retract. Most frequently hermit crabs utilize the shells of sea<br>
snails, marine gastropod mollusks. The tip of the hermit crab's abdomen is adapted to<br>
, g p p p<br>
clasp strongly onto the columella of the snail shell. As the hermit crab grows in size it<br>
has to find a larger shell and abandon the previous one.Hermit crabs live in the wild in<br>
colonies of 100 or more, and do not thrive in smaller numbers<br>

Brittle stars are echinoderms, closely related to starfish. They crawl across the seafloor using their flexible arms as &quot;legs&quot; for locomotion. The Brittle star generally have<br>
five long slender, whip-like arms which may reach up to 60 centimeters (2 feet) in<br>
length on the largest specimens.There are some 1,500 species of brittle stars living<br>
today, and they are largely found in deep waters more than 500 metres (1,650 feet)<br>
down.<br>

Sea Urchins are small, spiny sea creatures of the class Echinoidea found in oceans all<br>
over the world. (The name urchin is an old name for the round spiny hedgehogs sea<br>
urchins resemble.) Their shell, which is also called the &quot;test&quot;, is globular in shape and<br>
covered with spines. The size of an adult test is typically from 3 to 10 cm.Typical sea<br>
urchins have spines that are 1 to 3 cm in length, 1 to 2 mm thick, and not terribly sharp.<br>
Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, and red.<br>

Three-Rowed Sea Cucumber<br>
(<em>Isostichopus badionotus</em>)<br>
The sea cucumber is an echinoderm of the class Holothuroidea, with an elongated<br>
body and leathery skin, which is found on the sea floor worldwide. It is so named<br>
because of its cucumber-like shape. Like all echinoderms, sea cucumbers have an<br>
endoskeleton just below the skin, but this can actually be absent in some species<br>

Bryozoans are tiny colonial animals that generally build stony skeletons of calcium<br>
carbonate, superficially similar to coral. They are also known as moss animals (which<br>
is the literal Greek translation) or sea mats. They generally prefer warm, tropical waters<br>
but are known to occur worldwide. There are about 5,000 living species, with several<br>
times that number of fossil forms known.<br>

(Rock Barnacle)<br>
A barnacle is a type of arthropod belonging to infraclass <em>Cirripedia </em>in the subphylum<br>
                                                      <em>Crustacea</em>, and is hence distantly related to crabs and lobsters. Around 1,220 barnacle<br>
species are currently known. The name &quot;Cirripedia&quot; is Latin, meaning &quot;curl-footed&quot;.<br>

(Cushion Sea Star)<br>
Starfish or sea stars are any echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. The<br>
names sea star and starfish are also (incorrectly) used for the closely related brittle<br>
stars, which make up the class Ophiuroidea.They typically have five or more &quot;arms&quot;<br>
which radiate from an indistinct disk (pentaradial symmetry). Starfish do not rely on a<br>
jointed, movable skeleton for support and locomotion (although they are protected by<br>
their skeleton), but instead possess a hydraulic water vascular system that aids in<br>
locomotion. The water vascular system has many projections called tube feet on the<br>
bottom side of the starfish's arms which function in locomotion and aid with feeding.<br>

(Ragworm)<br>
Clamworms are predominantly marine organisms that may occasionally swim<br>
upstream to rivers and even climb to land (for example Lycastopsis catarractarum).<br>
They are commonly found in all water depths, foraging in seaweeds, hiding under rocks<br>
or burrowing in sand or mud. Nereids are mainly omnivorous but many are active<br>
carnivores.<br>

(Blubber Jellyfish)<br>
Jellyfish are marine invertebrates belonging to the class Scyphozoa of the phylum<br>
Cnidaria. They can be found in every ocean in the world and in some fresh waters. They<br>
are found drifting in the ocean either by themselves or in great schools. Each has a<br>
bell-shaped hollow body with tentacles used for catching food.<br>

(Common Limpet)<br>
The name Limpet is used for many kinds of mostly saltwater but also freshwater<br>
snails, specifically those that have a simple shell which is more or less broadly conical<br>
in shape, and which is either not coiled, or appears not to be coiled, in the adult snail.<br>
Thus the word &quot;limpet&quot; is an inexact term, which is fairly often used as part of the<br>
common name of a wide variety of different marine and freshwater gastropod species,<br>
some of which have gills and some of which have a lung. The name is given on the<br>
basis of a limpet-like or &quot;patelliform&quot; shell, but the several groups of snails which have<br>
such a shell are not at all closely related to one another.<br>

(Giant tube worm)<br>
The name tube worm may refer to any of a number of unrelated tube-dwelling wormlike invertebrates.<br>
These include chiefly various polychaetes, specifically the family Siboglinidae (beard<br>
worms), Serpulidae, and related families of the order Canalipalpata. Other groups also<br>
called tube worms include members of the phylum Phoronida (horseshoe worms).<br>

(Pearl Oyster)<br>
The common name oyster is used for a number of different groups of bivalve mollusks,<br>
most of which live in marine habitats or brackish water. The shell consists of two<br>
usually highly calcified valves which surround a soft body. Gills filter plankton from the<br>
water, and strong adductor muscles are used to hold the shell closed.Some of the<br>
groups known as oysters, also known as mullusks (true oysters), are highly prized as<br>
food, both raw and cooked (though the Bible categorizes them as unclean, and<br>
therefore unfit as human food). Some other groups also called oysters, such as pearl<br>
oysters, are not widely eaten, at least not since recent times. True (edible) oysters are<br>
incapable of making gem-quality pearls, although the opposite idea is a commonlyencountered misapprehension, often seen in illustrations or photographs where an<br>
edible oyster shell is mistakenly paired with a gem-quality pearl.<br>

Amphipoda (amphipods) is an order of animals that includes over 7,000 described<br>
species of small, shrimp-like crustaceans.Most amphipods are marine; although a<br>
small number of species are limnic or terrestrial. Marine amphipods may be pelagic<br>
(living in the water column) or benthic (living on the ocean bottom). Pelagic amphipods<br>
are eaten by seabirds, fish, and marine mammals. Terrestrial amphipods such as sand<br>
fleas can often be seen amongst sand and pebbles or on beaches.<br>

The sponges or poriferans (from Latin porus &quot;pore&quot; and ferre &quot;to bear&quot;) are animals of<br>
the phylum Porifera. Porifera translates to &quot;Pore-bearer&quot;. They are primitive, sessile,<br>
mostly marine, water dwelling filter feeders that pump water through their bodies to<br>
filter out particles of food matter. Sponges represent the simplest of animals. With no<br>
true tissues (parazoa), they lack muscles, nerves, and internal organs. There are over<br>
5,000 modern species of sponges known, and they can be found attached to surfaces<br>
anywhere from the intertidal zone to as deep as 8,500 m (29,000 feet) or further.<br>

living, they are covered with a suit of moveable spines that encompass the entire shell.<br>
Like its close relative the sea urchin, the sand dollar has a set of five pores arranged in<br>
a petal pattern. The pores are used to move sea water into its internal water-vascular<br>
system, which allows the creature to move.Sand dollars live beyond mean low water on<br>
top of or just beneath the surface of sandy or muddy areas. The spines on the<br>
somewhat flattened underside of the animal allow it to burrow or to slowly creep<br>
through the sand. Fine, hair-like cilia cover the tiny spines. Tubefeet or podia that line<br>
the food grooves, move food to the mouth opening which is in the center of the star<br>
shaped grooves on the underside of the animal called the oral surface. Its food<br>
consists of crustacean larvae, small copepods, detritus, diatoms, algae and organic<br>
particles that end up in the sandy bottom.On the ocean bottom, sand dollars are<br>
frequently found together.<br>

(Brain Coral)<br>
Corals are skeletal remains of marine organisms from the class Anthozoa and exist as<br>
small sea anemone–like polyps, typically in colonies of many identical individuals. The<br>
group includes the important reef builders that are found in tropical oceans, which<br>
secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.Over thousands of generations, the<br>
polyps lay down a skeleton that is characteristic of their species. A head of coral grows<br>
by asexual reproduction of the individual polyps. Corals also breed sexually by<br>
spawning, with corals of the same species releasing gametes simultaneously over a<br>
period of one to several nights around a full moon.Although corals can catch plankton<br>
using stinging cells on their tentacles, these animals obtain most of their nutrients<br>
from symbiotic unicellular algae called zooxanthellae. Consequently, most corals<br>
depend on sunlight and grow in clear and shallow water, typically at depths shallower<br>
than 60 m (200 ft).<br>

(Common Ghost Crab)<br>
Ghost crabs, also called sand crabs, are crabs of the genus Ocypode, common shore<br>
crabs in many countries. In the eastern United States, Ocypode quadrata is frequently<br>
seen scurrying along beaches between sunset and dawn.These crabs are called ghosts<br>
because of their ability to disappear from sight almost instantly, scuttling at speeds up<br>
to 10 miles per hour, while making sharp directional changes. These creatures have<br>
two black eyes, with sharp 360° vision which they use to see flying insects and catch<br>
them in mid air. The ghost crab, however, cannot see directly up, so it must burrow into<br>
the ground to prevent birds from catching it.The ghost crab tunnels down four feet into<br>
the ground at a 45° angle, creating 1-2 inch wide holes, which speckle the beach. At<br>
dusk, these crabs will sprint to the ocean in order to obtain oxygen from the water<br>
which washes over their gills, and in June, females will release their eggs into the<br>
ocean. Ghost crabs hibernate during the winter, holding their breath for six months, by<br>
storing oxygen in sacs near the gills. They can also have a natural filter system which<br>
gathers oxygen from the air humans breathe, enough to survive for one year without<br>
entering into water.<br>

Hard-bodied animals, such as crabs, sea star, and chitons, may be killed in a<br>
5% solution of formaldehyde or a 70% solution of alcohol, and then dried by a<br>

a 3% solution of formaldehyde or a 70% solution of alcohol. If commercial<br>
formalin is used in place of formaldehyde, the above percentage figures<br>
should be doubled.<br>

Most jellyfish are passive drifters and slow swimmers, as their shape is not<br>

reach of their tentacles. They do this by rhythmically opening and closing their bell-like<br>
body.<br>

Many of the animals in requirement #1 are beautiful to look at, and this makes<br>
them a tourist attraction in many areas. The economy of such places is <em>built </em>on<br>
tourism, and these animals are an important part of the draw.<br>
Hermit crabs are sold as pets.<br>
Though none of the animals listed here are Biblically clean, many of them are<br>
eaten. Entire communities base their economies on the catching of shell fish such<br>
as oysters, clams, crabs, and mussels. Some, such as the sea urchin, are served as<br>
delicacies<br>
Plankton (such as shrimp and sand fleas) are positioned at the base of the food<br>
chain, providing nutrients to larger fish which are then eaten by humans. Plankton<br>
is also used by some people as a dietary supplement.<br>

Where found: Arctic and sub-arctic oceans around North America, Russia and<br>
Greenland.<br>
Description: Adapted to life in the Arctic, it has a number of anatomical and<br>
physiological characteristics that differentiate it from other cetaceans. The<br>
unmistakable all-white colour, absence of a dorsal fin, and the distinctive protuberance<br>
at the front of its head which houses an echolocation organ called the melon. The<br>
beluga’s body size is between that of a dolphin’s and a true whale’s, with males growing<br>
up to 5.5 m (18 ft) long and weighing up to 1,600 kg (3,500 lb). This whale has a stocky<br>
body; it has the greatest percentage of blubber. Its sense of hearing is highly developed<br>
and it possesses echolocation, which allows it to move about and find blowholes under<br>
sheet ice. Belugas form groups of up to 10 animals on average, although during the<br>
summer months, they can gather in the hundreds or even thousands in estuaries and<br>
shallow coastal areas. They are slow swimmers, but they can dive down to 700 m<br>
(2,300 ft) below the surface. They are opportunistic feeders and their diets vary<br>
according to their locations and the season. They mainly eat fish, crustaceans and<br>
other deep-sea invertebrates. Worldwide population is thought be around 150,000<br>
individuals. They are migratory and the majority of groups spend the winter around the<br>
arctic ice cap; but when the sea ice melts in summer, they move to warmer river<br>
estuaries and coastal areas. Belugas are one of the cetaceans most commonly kept in<br>
captivity in aquaria and wildlife parks in North America, Europe and Asia where they are<br>
popular with the public due to their colour and expressivity. </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Wilma the Beluga Whale<br>

Sperm Whale (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Physeter macrocephalus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The sperm whale can be found anywhere in the open ocean.<br>
Description: Largest of the toothed whales and largest toothed predator in the world.<br>
The Sperm Whale breaks all kinds of records! Mature males may reach 20.5 metres (67<br>
ft) and 57,000 kilograms (males much larger than females). It is the loudest of any<br>
animal, second deepest diving mammal with dives of up to 90 minutes, largest brain<br>
(five times heavier than a human brain), 116 kg (255 lbs) heart, longest intestinal<br>
system (exceeding 300 m in larger specimens) and other mind blowing measurements.<br>
The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head,<br>
which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is<br>
located very close to the front of the head and shifted to the whale's left, giving a<br>
distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray. Primary food is squid and they can live for<br>
more than 60 years. The sperm whale's flukes are triangular and very thick.<br>
Proportionally, they are larger than that of any other cetacean, and are very flexible. The<br>
whale lifts its flukes high out of the water as it begins a feeding dive. It has a series of<br>
ridges on the back's caudal third instead of a dorsal fin. The largest ridge was called<br>
the 'hump', and can be mistaken for a dorsal fin because of its shape and size. In<br>
contrast to the smooth skin of most large whales, its back skin is usually wrinkly and<br>
has been likened to a prune by whale-watching enthusiasts. From the early 18th<br>
century through the late 20th the species was a prime target of whalers. The head of<br>
the whale contains a liquid wax called spermaceti, which was used in lubricants, oil<br>
lamps, and candles. Ambergris, a waste product from its digestive system, is still used<br>
as a fixative in perfumes. The Sperm Whale is now protected by a whaling moratorium,<br>
and is currently listed as vulnerable. Sperm whales have sunk ships, including the real<br>
life Moby Dick who sunk the Essex. </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Jonathan Bird's Blue World: Sperm Whales<br>

Pygmy &amp; Dwarf Sperm Whales (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Kogia breviceps</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Dwarf and Pygmy sperm whales are found throughout the tropical and<br>
temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, they are rarely<br>
sighted at sea, so most data come from stranded and captured animals - making a<br>
precise range and migration map difficult. The dwarf is more coastal than the pygmy.<br>
There is no accurate estimate of number of these whales in the world or good data on<br>
conservation status.<br>
Description: The dwarf sperm whale is the smallest species commonly known as a<br>
whale. It grows up to 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in length and 250 kilograms (550 lb) in weight. The<br>
species makes slow, deliberate movements with little splash or blow and usually lies<br>
motionless when at the sea's surface. Consequently it is usually observed only in very<br>
calm seas. These two species were not distinguished from each other until 1966 and<br>
are difficult to tell apart but the dwarf is slightly smaller and has a larger dorsal fin than<br>
the pygmy. The body is mainly bluish gray with a lighter underside with slightly yellow<br>
vein-like streaks possibly visible. There is a white false gill behind each eye. The<br>
flippers are very short and broad. The top of the snout overhangs the lower jaw, which<br>
is small. The whales have long, curved and sharp teeth (0–6 in the upper jaw, between<br>
14 and 26 in the lower). These whales expel a dark reddish substance when frightened<br>
or attacked—possibly to put off any predators. They are usually solitary or paired but<br>
have occasionally been seen in small groups. All sperm whales have a spermaceti<br>
organ in the forehead. The brain of the dwarf sperm whale is roughly half a kilogram in<br>
mass.</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Video of stranded Pygmy Sperm Whale<br>

Giant Beaked Whale/Arnoux and Baird’s Beaked Whales<br>
(</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Berardius</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Arnoux’s beaked whale Berardius arnuxii lives in cold Southern<br>
Hemisphere waters and Baird’s beaked whale Berardius bairdii is found the cold<br>
temperate waters of the North Pacific.<br>
Description: You would not be able to see the differences between Arnoux and Baird’s<br>
beaked whales except that they live on opposite ends of the world. They grow to 10–12<br>
m in length and up to 14,000 kg (31,000 lb). They have very long prominent beak, even<br>
by beaked whale standards. The lower jaw is longer than the upper and the front teeth<br>
are visible even when the mouth is fully closed. The melon is particularly bulbous. The<br>
body shape is slender - the girth is only 50% of length. The body is uniformly coloured<br>
and a particular individual's colour may be anything from light grey through to black.<br>
The flippers are small, rounded and set towards the front of the body. The dorsal fin<br>
similarly is small and rounded and set about three-quarters of the way along the back.<br>
Adult males and females of both species pick up numerous white linear scars all over<br>
the body as they age and may be a rough indicator of age.<br>
B. arnuxii is known as Arnoux's beaked whale, southern four-toothed whale,<br>
southern beaked whale, New Zealand beaked whale, southern giant bottlenose<br>
whale, and southern porpoise whale.<br>
B. bairdii is known as Baird's beaked whale, northern giant bottlenose whale, North<br>
Pacific bottlenose whale, giant four-toothed whale, northern four-toothed whale,<br>
and North Pacific four-toothed whale.<br>

Northern and Southern Bottlenose Whales (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Hyperoodon</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Northern bottlenose whale are found in the North Atlantic Ocean and is<br>
found in cool and subarctic deep waters such as the Davis Strait, the Labrador Sea, the<br>
Greenland Sea and the Barents Sea and as far south as Cape Verde Islands. Southern<br>
bottlenose whales are probably the most abundant whale in Antarctic waters.<br>
Description: These sister species are fairly rotund with an extremely bluff melon. The<br>
beak is long and white on males but grey on females. The dorsal fin is relatively small<br>
at 30–38 centimetres (12–15 in) and set behind the middle of the back. It is falcate<br>
(sickle-shaped) and usually pointed. The Northern species measures 9.8 metres (32 ft)<br>
in length when physically mature. The back is mid-to-dark grey, with a lighter underside.<br>
The Southern bottlenose whale smaller growing to 7.5 m (25 ft) in length when<br>
physically mature. The back is light-to-mid grey, also with a lighter underside. Males are<br>
about 25% larger than females. These bottlenose whales live up to 37 years. Weight<br>
estimates are hard to come by. For the northern bottlenose whale, 5,800–7,500<br>
kilograms (12,800–16,500 lb) is given somewhat consistently, while the smaller and<br>
less studied southern species will be lighter. The bottlenose whales are some of the<br>
deepest diving mammals known, reaching depths of 1453 m (4767 ft) The whales feed<br>
on squid, sea cucumbers, herring, cuttlefish, sea stars and other benthic<br>
invertebrates.</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Video Northern Bottlenose Whale<br>

Cuvier's beaked whale (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Ziphius cavirostris</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Open ocean worldwide except in the Arctic and Southern oceans.<br>
Description: The Cuvier's beaked whale or goose-beaked whale is the most widely<br>
distributed of all the beaked whales. Individuals commonly have white scars and<br>
patches caused by cookiecutter sharks. It prefers depth greater than 1,000 m (3,300 ft)<br>
and avoids ships, it is still one of the most frequently spotted beaked whales. The<br>
maximum known depth reached by the Cuvier's beaked whale is 2,992 metres (9,816<br>
ft), or 1.8 miles, making it the deepest-diving mammal. The species name comes from<br>
Greek xiphos, &quot;sword&quot;, and Latin cavus, &quot;hollow&quot; and rostrum, &quot;beak&quot;, referring to the<br>
indentation on the head in front of the blowhole. The body of Cuvier's beaked whale is<br>
robust and cigar-shaped, similar to those of other beaked whales and can be difficult to<br>
distinguish from many of the mesoplodont whales at sea. Males and females are the<br>
same size up to about 5–7 m (16–23 ft) in length 2,500 kg (5,500 lb). The dorsal fin is<br>
curved, small and located two-thirds of the body length behind the head. Flippers are<br>
equally small and narrow and can be tucked into pockets in the body wall, presumably<br>
to prevent drag while swimming. Like other beaked whales, its flukes are large and lack<br>
the medial notch found in all other cetaceans. The head is short with a small, poorly<br>
defined rostrum and a gently sloping melon. A pair of throat grooves allow the whale to<br>
expand this region when sucking in its prey. Cuvier's beaked whale has a short beak in<br>
comparison with other species in its family, with a slightly bulbous melon. The melon is<br>
white or creamy in color and a white strip runs back to the dorsal fin about two-thirds<br>
of the way along the back. The rest of the body color varies by individual: some are<br>
dark grey; others a reddish-brown. The dorsal fin varies in shape from triangular to<br>
highly falcate, whilst the fluke is about one-quarter the body length. They live for forty<br>
years. </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Culvers beaked whale<br>

Balaenoptera musculus<br>
The blue whale (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Balaenoptera musculus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the<br>
beginning of the twentieth century. For over a century, they were hunted almost to<br>
extinction by whalers until protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002<br>
report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide located in at least<br>
five groups. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering<br>
approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller<br>
(around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and<br>
Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two<br>
in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
Description:<br>
At 30 metres (98 ft) in length and 170 tonnes (190 short tons) or more in weight, the<br>
Blue Whale is the largest known animal ever to have existed.<br>
Long and slender, the blue whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally<br>
and somewhat lighter underneath. There are at least three distinct subspecies: B. m.<br>
musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia of the Southern<br>
Ocean and B. m. brevicauda (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian<br>
Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may be<br>
another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively<br>
of small crustaceans known as krill.<br>
Balaena mysticetus<br>
Bowhead Whale (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Balaena mysticetus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The bowhead spends all of its life in fertile Arctic waters, unlike other<br>
whales that migrate for feeding or reproduction.<br>
Description: Bowhead whales are robust-bodied, dark-colored animals with no dorsal<br>
fin and a strongly bowed lower jaw and narrow upper jaw. The baleen plates, exceeding<br>
three meters and the longest of the baleen whales, are used to strain tiny prey from the<br>
water. The whales have massive bony skulls which they use to break from beneath the<br>
ice to breathe. Some Inuit hunters have reported whales surfacing through 60 cm (2 ft)<br>
of ice in this method. Bowheads may reach lengths of up to 20 metres and females are<br>
larger than males.<br>
Megaptera novaeangliae<br>
Humpback Whale (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Megaptera novaeangliae</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Humpback Whale lives in oceans and seas around the world, and is<br>
regularly sought out by whale-watchers.<br>
Description: The Humpback is a very large whale. It is well known for its breaching<br>
(leaping out of the water), its unusually long front fins, and its complex whale song. The<br>
species feeds only in summer and lives off fat reserves during winter. It is an energetic<br>
feeder, taking krill and small schooling fish, such as herring, capelin and sand lance. It<br>
will hunt fish by direct attack or by stunning them by hitting the water with its flippers or<br>
flukes. Its most inventive feeding technique is called bubble net fishing. A group of<br>
whales will blow bubbles while swimming to create a visual barrier against fish, while<br>
one or more whales in the group make vocalizations that drive the fish against the wall.<br>
The bubble wall is then closed, encircling the fish, which are confined in an ever-tighter<br>
area. The whales then suddenly swim upwards and through the bubble net, mouths<br>
agape, swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp. This technique can involve a ring of<br>
bubbles up to 30 m (100 ft) in diameter and the cooperation of a dozen animals at<br>
once. It is one of the more spectacular acts of collaboration and cooperation among<br>
marine mammals.<br>
Eschrichtius robustus<br>
Grey Whale (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Eschrichtius robustus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Two Pacific Ocean populations of Gray Whales exist: one small<br>
population traveling between the Sea of Okhotsk and southern Korea, and a larger one<br>
traveling between the waters off Alaska and the Baja California. A third, North Atlantic,<br>
population was hunted to extinction 300 years ago. In the fall, the California Gray Whale<br>
starts a 2–3 month, 8,000–11,000 km trip south along the west coast of the United<br>
States and Mexico. The animals travel in small groups. The destinations of the whales<br>
are the coastal waters of Baja California and the southern Gulf of California, where they<br>
breed and the young are born.<br>
Description:<br>
Gray Whales are covered by characteristic gray-white patterns, scars left by parasites<br>
which drop off in the cold feeding grounds. The whale feeds mainly on benthic<br>
crustaceans which it eats by turning on its side (usually the right) and scooping up the<br>
sediments from the sea floor. It is classified as a baleen whale and has a baleen, or<br>
whalebone, which acts like a sieve to capture small sea animals including amphipods<br>
taken in along with sand, water and other material. Mostly, the animal feeds in the<br>
northern waters during the summer; and opportunistically feeds during its migration<br>
trip, depending primarily on its extensive fat reserves.<br>
Caperea marginata<br>
Pygmy right whale (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Caperea marginata</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Southern Ocean<br>
Description: The Pygmy right whale is rarely seen and little studied. Only about 25 &quot;at<br>
sea&quot; sightings have been recorded. It is not a right whale (misnamed) and was thought<br>
extinct until 2012. The smallest of the baleen whales, ranging between 6 metres (20 ft)<br>
and 6.5 metres (21 ft) in length and 3,000 and 3,500 kg in mass. Despite its name, the<br>
pygmy right whale may have more in common with the gray whale and rorquals than<br>
the bowhead and right whales.<br>

Monachus schauinslandi<br>
Hawaiian Monk Seal (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Monachus schauinslandi</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Hawaiian Monk Seals are found in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands<br>
and only occasionally seen around the major islands of Ni'ihau and Kaua'i—very rarely<br>
on beaches on O'ahu or the other islands. The largest population (less than 400<br>
animals in 2002) occurs at French Frigate Shoals.<br>
Description: Mature Hawaiian Monk Seals feature a grey pelage, or coat which turns<br>
brown with weathering. Young Hawaiian Monk Seals are silver with creamy white<br>
bellies, chests and throats. Pups are black and woolly with fuzzy short hair. Newborn<br>
pups are clad in a black natal fur. Hawaiian monk seals tend to sport scars from<br>
attempted shark attacks or injuries from fishing gear. Hawaiian Monk Seals are one of<br>
the most endangered species of all seals, although its cousin species the<br>
Mediterranean Monk Seal (M. monachus) is equally rare, and the Caribbean Monk Seal<br>
(M. tropicalis), last seen off Yucatan, became extinct in the 1950s. It is estimated that<br>
fewer than 1,400 Hawaiian Monk Seals existed in 2004.<br>
Mirounga<br>
Elephant Seal (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Mirounga</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Northern Elephant Seal, somewhat smaller than its southern relative,<br>
ranges over the Pacific coast of the U.S. and Mexico. The Southern Elephant Seal is<br>
found in the southern hemisphere on islands such as South Georgia, Macquarie Island,<br>
and on the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina in the Peninsula Valdés,<br>
which is the fourth largest elephant seal colony in the world and the only growing<br>
population.<br>
Description: Elephant seals take their name from the great size of their bodies and the<br>
large proboscis of the adult males (bulls) which resembles an elephant's trunk. The<br>
bull's proboscis is used in producing extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially<br>
during the mating season. More importantly, however, the nose acts as a sort of<br>
rebreather, filled with cavities designed to reabsorb moisture from the animals'<br>
exhalations. This is important during the mating season when the male seals rarely<br>
leave the beach to feed, and therefore must conserve body moisture, as they have no<br>
incoming source of water.<br>
Hydrurga leptonyx<br>
Leopard Seal (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Hydrurga leptonyx</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: Leopard Seals live in the cold waters surrounding Antarctica. During the<br>
summer months, they hunt among the pack ice surrounding the continent, spending<br>
almost all of their time in the water. In the winter, they range north to the sub-Antarctic<br>
islands.<br>
Description: Leopard Seals are large and muscular, with dark gray backs and light gray<br>
bellies. Their throats are whitish with the black spots that give the seals their common<br>
name. Females are generally larger than the males. They feed on a wide variety of<br>
creatures: smaller seals probably eat mostly krill, but also squid and fish. Larger<br>
Leopard seals probably switch to feed on King and Emperor Penguins and, less<br>
frequently, seals such as Crabeater Seals. Leopard Seals are bold, powerful and<br>
curious. In the water, there is a fine line between curiosity and predatory behavior, and<br>
they may 'play' with penguins that they do not intend to eat.<br>
Halichoerus grypus<br>
Grey Seal (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Halichoerus grypus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Grey Seal is found on both shores of the North Atlantic Ocean. In<br>
Britain and Ireland, the Grey Seal breeds in several colonies on and around the coasts;<br>
notably large colonies are at the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast (about<br>
6,000 animals), and North Rona off the north coast of Scotland and Lambay Island off<br>
the coast of Dublin. In Canada, they are typically seen in areas like the Gulf of St.<br>
Lawrence, Newfoundland and the Maritimes, and Quebec. In the United States one<br>
finds them year round off the New England coasts (in particular Maine and<br>
Massachusetts) and slightly less frequently in the Middle Atlantic States, though their<br>
natural range extends to Virginia.<br>
Description: Grey seals feed on a wide variety of fish, taken at depths down to 70m<br>
(230ft) or more. Sandeels are important in their diet in many localities. Cods and other<br>
gadids, flatfish, herring and skates are also important locally. However, it is clear that<br>
Grey seals will eat whatever is available, including octopus and lobsters. The average<br>
daily food requirement is estimated to be 5kg (11lb), though the seals do not feed every<br>
day and they fast the breeding season.<br>

Northern Fur Seal (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Callorhinus ursinus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Northern Fur Seal is found in the north Pacific Ocean.<br>
Description: The Northern Fur Seal, has substantial physical differences compared to<br>
other eared seals: its head is smaller, snout shorter and the hind flippers are<br>
proportionately largest of any eared seal. The most conspicuous physical feature of<br>
the fur seal is the fur itself; indeed, its genus name comes from the Greek for &quot;beautiful<br>
hide&quot;. It consists of longer lighter guard hairs and a dense waterproof underfur of about<br>
46,500 hairs per square centimeter.<br>
Arctocephalus gazella<br>
Antarctic Fur Seal (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Arctocephalus gazella</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: As its name suggests, the Antarctic Fur Seal is distributed in Antarctic<br>
waters. Around 95% of the world population breeds at South Georgia.<br>
Description: This fur seal has a short and broad snout compared with others in the<br>
family. Adult males are dark brown. Females and juveniles tend to be grey with a lighter<br>
underside. Antarctic Fur Seals appear to act alone when foraging and migrating. A<br>
strong male may have more than a dozen female partners in a single season.<br>
Territories are established on breeding grounds in October to early November, when the<br>
musty-smelling males are extremely aggressive in defense of their harems. Females<br>
gestate for just over a year - giving birth in November or December. Pups are weaned at<br>
about month old. Juveniles may then spend several years in the water before returning<br>
to begin their breeding cycle.<br>
Eumetopias jubatus<br>
Steller Sea Lion (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Eumetopias jubatus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Steller Sea Lion, also known as the Northern Sea Lion, lives in the<br>
temperate eastern Pacific.<br>
Description: The Steller Sea Lion is the largest of the eared seals, measuring up to 3.3<br>
m in length, with males weighing up to 1,100 kg while females weigh around 350 kg.<br>
Their coloration is lighter than in most sea lions, ranging from a pale yellow to a tawny<br>
and occasionally reddish, though they often appear darker in the water. The pups are<br>
born almost black and remain dark for several months.<br>

California Sea Lion (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Zalophus californianus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The California Sea Lion is a coastal sea lion of the northern Pacific<br>
Ocean.<br>
Description: The California Sea Lion has a streamlined body that contains a layer of<br>
blubber under the skin to provide warmth and buoyancy. Their large eyes help them<br>
adjust to low levels of light in underwater environments, while their whiskers augment<br>
their sense of touch. Their nostrils automatically close once they hit the water. Their<br>
long front flippers rotate outward for better movement on land, and propel them<br>
forward in water, where they are most at home.<br>

Orcinus orca<br>
Orca, or killer whale (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Orcinus orca</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The orca is found in all the world's oceans, from the frigid Arctic and<br>
Antarctic regions to warm, tropical seas.<br>
Description: The Orca or Killer Whale is the largest species of the oceanic dolphin<br>
family (Delphinidae). Orcas are versatile predators, with some populations feeding<br>
mostly on fish and others on other marine mammals, including large whales. Wild<br>
orcas are usually not considered a threat to humans.<br>
Tursiops truncatus<br>
Bottlenose dolphin (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Tursiops truncatus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Bottlenose dolphin inhabits warm and temperate seas worldwide<br>
and may be found in all but the Arctic and the Antarctic Oceans.<br>
Description: The Bottlenose Dolphin is the most common and well-known dolphin<br>
species. They are gray, varying from dark gray at the top near the dorsal fin to very light<br>
gray and almost white at the underside. This makes them harder to see both from<br>
above and below when swimming. The elongated upper and lower jaws form what is<br>
called the rostrum and give the animals their name of Bottlenose. The real nose<br>
however is the blowhole on top of the head, and the nasal septum is visible when the<br>
blowhole is open. Their face shows a characteristic &quot;smile&quot;.<br>
Delphinus delphis<br>
Common dolphin (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Delphinus delphis</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The common dolphin is widely distributed in temperate, sub-tropical and<br>
tropical waters throughout the world in a band roughly spanning 40 degrees south to<br>
50 degrees north. The species typically prefer enclosed bodies of water such as the<br>
Red and Mediterranean Seas. Deep off-shore waters and to a lesser extent over<br>
continental shelves are preferred to shallow waters. Some populations may be present<br>
all year round, others appear to move in a migratory pattern. Preferred surface water<br>
temperature is 10-28 degrees Celsius.<br>
Description: Common dolphins travel in groups of around 10-50 in number and<br>
frequently gather into schools numbering 100 to 2000 individuals. These schools are<br>
generally very active - groups often surface, jump and splash together. Typical behavior<br>
includes breaching, tail-slapping, chin-slapping, bow-riding and porpoising.<br>
Neophocaena phocaenoides<br>
Finless Porpoise (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Neophocaena phocaenoides</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Finless Porpoise lives in the coastal waters of Asia, especially<br>
around India, China, Indonesia and Japan. A unique fresh water population is found in<br>
the Yangtze River. At the western end, their range includes the length of the western<br>
coast of India and continues up into the Persian Gulf. Throughout their range, the<br>
porpoises stay in shallow waters (up to 50m), close to the shore, in waters with soft or<br>
sandy seabeds. In exceptional cases they have been encountered as far as 100 miles<br>
off-shore in the East China and Yellow Seas, albeit still in shallow water.<br>
Description: The Finless Porpoise almost completely lacks a dorsal fin. Instead there is<br>
a low ridge covered in thick denticulated skin. Adult Finless porpoises are a uniform<br>
light grey color. Infants are mostly black with grey around the dorsal ridge area,<br>
becoming grey after 4-6 months.<br>
Phocoena phocaena<br>
Harbour Porpoise (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Phocoena phocaena</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Harbour Porpoise, as its name implies, stays close to coastal areas<br>
or river estuaries and as such is the most familiar porpoise to whale watchers. This<br>
porpoise often ventures up rivers and has been seen hundreds of miles from the sea.<br>
Description: The Harbour Porpoise is a little smaller than the other porpoises. It is<br>
about 75 cm long at birth. Males grow up to 1.6 m and females to 1.7 m. The females<br>
are correspondingly heavier, with a maximum weight of around 76 kg compared with<br>
the males' 61 kg. The body is robust and the animal is at its maximum girth just in front<br>
of its triangular dorsal fin. The beak is poorly demarcated. The flippers, dorsal fin, tail<br>
fin and back are a dark grey. The sides are a slightly speckled lighter grey. The<br>
underside is much whiter, though there are usually grey stripes running along the throat<br>
from the underside of the mouth to the flippers.<br>

Odobenus rosmarus<br>
Walrus (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Odobenus rosmarus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Walrus lives in the cold Arctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere.<br>
Description: Walruses spend about half their time in the water and half their time on<br>
beaches or ice floes, where they gather in large herds. They may spend several days at<br>
a time either on land or in the sea. Diving to depths of 90 m (300 ft), they sometimes<br>
stay under for as long as a half hour. They use their pectoral flippers to move along out<br>
of water and can stand on all fours with an awkward gait when on rough surfaces.<br>

Enhydra lutris<br>
Sea Otter (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Enhydra lutris</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Sea Otter is native to the North Pacific, from northern Japan and<br>
Kamchatka east across the Aleutian Islands south to California.<br>
Description: Hunted extensively for their luxurious fur—the densest of all mammals<br>
with up to 394,000 hairs per square centimeter— from 1741 onwards, sea otter<br>
populations were greatly reduced to the point of extermination in many parts of their<br>
historic range. By 1911 the world population was estimated to be just 1,000-2,000<br>
individuals in 13 colonies. Its estimated that a half million to a million otters were killed<br>
over time and over hunted and the population is thought to have been 150,000 to<br>
300,000 historically before the years of the great hunt. Although several subspecies are<br>
still endangered, the otters have since been legally protected, and reintroduction efforts<br>
have shown positive results in some areas.<br>

Trichechus inunguis<br>
Amazonian Manatee (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Trichechus inunguis</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: The Amazonian Manatee lives in the freshwater habitats of the Amazon<br>
River and its tributaries.<br>
Description: The Amazonian Manatee's color is brownish gray and they have thick,<br>
wrinkled skin, often with coarse hair, or &quot;whiskers.&quot; Its main predator is man. The three<br>
species of manatees, and the closely related Dugong, are unique in that they are the<br>
only plant-eating marine mammals.<br>
Trichechus manatus<br>
West Indian Manatee (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Trichechus manatus</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: As its name implies, the West Indian Manatee lives in the West Indies,<br>
generally in shallow coastal areas. However, it is known to withstand large changes in<br>
water salinity, and so have also been found in shallow rivers and estuaries. It is limited<br>
to the tropics and sub-tropics due to an extremely low metabolic rate and lack of a<br>
thick layer of insulating body fat. During summer, these large mammals have even been<br>
found as far north as Rhode Island.<br>
Description: The West Indian Manatee is a manatee, and the largest surviving member<br>
of the aquatic mammal order Sirenia. The West Indian Manatee is surprisingly agile in<br>
water, and individuals have been seen doing rolls, somersaults, and even swimming<br>
upside-down. Manatees are not territorial and do not have complex predator avoidance<br>
behavior, as they live in areas without natural predators.<br>
Trichechus senegalensis<br>
African Manatee (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Trichechus senegalensis</span><span style="color:#212529;">)<br>
Where found: African Manatees are found in coastal marine and estuarine habitats,<br>
and in fresh water river systems along the west coast of Africa from the Senegal River<br>
south to the Kwanza River in Angola, including areas in Gambia, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau,<br>
Guinea, Sierra Leone, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of<br>
the Congo, and Democratic Republic of the Congo.<br>
Description: The African Manatee is a species of manatee, and is the least studied of<br>
the four species of sirenians. Photos of African Manatees are very rare; although very<br>
little is known about this species, scientists think they are similar to the West Indian<br>
Manatees.<br>

This is, of course, the story of Jonah located in the Biblical Book of </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Jonah</span><span style="color:#212529;">, .<br>

The largest mammal in the sea, and indeed, the largest animal in the history of the world, is<br>
the Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Explain the following words:<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Breaching<br>
Breaching is when a whale leaps into the air and falls on their backs. There are a variety<br>
of explanations about why different whales and dolphins perform this artful leap. Some<br>
researchers have proposed it may be a behavior to dislodge parasites off of the whale's<br>
back, while others have interpreted it as a form of communication. Some believe the<br>
whale is just having fun!<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Echolocation<br>
Echolocation is the biological sonar used by several mammals such as bats, dolphins<br>
and whales.<br>
Animals that use echolocation emit calls out to the environment. They listen to the<br>
echoes that return from various objects in the environment. They use these echoes to<br>
locate, range and identify the objects. Echolocation is used for navigation and for<br>
foraging (or hunting) in various environments.<br>
Toothed whales, including dolphins, porpoises, river dolphins, orcas and sperm whales,<br>
use echolocation because they live in an underwater habitat that has favorable<br>
acoustic characteristics and where vision is extremely limited in range due to<br>
absorption or turbidity.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Spyhopping<br>
Spyhopping is when a dolphin and whales are in a vertical stance so they can look at<br>
their surroundings above the water. The whale slowly rises straight out of the water,<br>
until its eye is above the water surface. After a few moments, the whale sinks back<br>
down. Again, we cannot be sure why whales spyhop, but they may be coming up to<br>
take a look around.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Baleen<br>
Baleen<br>
Baleen makes up baleen plates, which are arranged<br>
in two parallel rows that look like combs of thick<br>
hair; they are attached to the upper jaws of baleen<br>
whales. Whales use these combs for filter feeding.<br>
Baleen whales scoop vast amounts of water into<br>
their mouths, and then push the water back out<br>
their mouths through the baleen plates. The baleen<br>
plates prevent fish and plankton from flowing out of<br>
their mouths. Whales are the only vertebrate group to use this method of feeding in<br>
great abundance (flamingos and crabeater seals use similar methods, but do not have<br>
baleen), and it has allowed them to grow to immense sizes.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Pod<br>
A pod is a social group of whales, porpoises, or dolphins.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4f </span><span style="color:#212529;">Harem<br>
A harem is a group of female seals, which are corralled together by a male for the<br>
purpose of mating. The male Northern Fur Seals are possessive of individual females<br>
in their harem, often aggressively competing with neighboring males for females.<br>
Some males breed with up to 50 females in a single breeding season. Some types of<br>
whales also have harems.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4g </span><span style="color:#212529;">Plankton<br>
Plankton are defined as any drifting organism that inhabits the water column of<br>
oceans, seas, and bodies of fresh water. They are widely considered to be one of the<br>
most important organisms on Earth, due to the food supply they provide to most<br>
aquatic life.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Draw a food chain of two different marine mammals.<br>
phytoplankton </span><span style="color:#212529;">→</span><span style="color:#212529;"> copepod </span><span style="color:#212529;">→</span><span style="color:#212529;"> fish </span><span style="color:#212529;">→</span><span style="color:#212529;"> squid </span><span style="color:#212529;">→</span><span style="color:#212529;"> seal </span><span style="color:#212529;">→</span><span style="color:#212529;"> orca<br>
This &quot;chain&quot; can be described as follows: Orca (also known as &quot;killer whales&quot;) feed upon seals,<br>
that feed upon squid, that eat small fish, that feed on copepods, that feed on microscopic<br>
algae.<br>
phytoplankton </span><span style="color:#212529;">→</span><span style="color:#212529;"> krill </span><span style="color:#212529;">→</span><span style="color:#212529;"> baleen whales<br>
Food loses efficiency as it travels up the food chain from prey to predator. This is because<br>
each creature in the chain uses some of the energy it gained from its food. By keeping their<br>
food chain short, baleen whales are able to efficiently consume enormous amounts of energy,<br>
and therefore, they are able to grow to enormous sizes.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">What is the purpose of blubber?<br>
Blubber is a thick layer of fat found under the skin of all cetaceans, pinnipeds and sirenians. It<br>
covers the whole body, except for the appendages, loosely attached to the muscles. It can<br>
comprise up to 50% of the body mass of some marine mammals during some points in their<br>
lives. Blubber serves several different functions, it is the primary area of fat on some<br>
mammals, and essential for storing energy. It is particularly important for species which feed<br>
and breed in different parts of the ocean. During these periods the species are operating on a<br>
fat-based metabolism.<br>
Blubber also serves as an efficient thermal insulator, making it an essential for<br>
thermoregulation. It has advantages over fur (as used in Sea Otters) in this respect; fur can<br>
retain heat by holding pockets of air, but under pressure (while diving) the air pockets will be<br>
expelled. Blubber, however, does not compress under pressure. It can also aid in buoyancy,<br>
and acts to streamline the body.<br>

Seals are hunted for their fur, meat and oil. They are also hunted by fishermen to eliminate<br>
competition for fish. Seals sometimes take bites out of fish already caught in a fisherman's<br>
net, making the fish unfit for sale.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Describe why seals and dolphins can move so quickly in the water.<br>
The seal's flippers are enormously long, and the skin between them forms a web which is<br>
used like a paddle to propel the seal along. They have long, sturdy claws on their front flippers<br>
which they use to help them move on land, especially when they need to grip onto rocks or ice<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">9 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Do one of the following:<br>

schedule of a marine mammal.<br>
This option will almost certainly be the most rewarding for your Pathfinders, but it will<br>
also require the most work on your part to get it organized. Try to contact the aquarium<br>
before setting off on your trip so that you can make arrangements to meet with a staff<br>
member there. They are usually very willing to help you, and will be delighted to provide<br>
you with information regarding the daily feeding schedule. Note that some zoos have<br>
aquariums too, so if a zoo is more convenient than an aquarium, you might want to<br>
investigate this possibility.<br>
If you are planning to visit a zoo or aquarium, be aware that there are various honors<br>
that have requirements which can be met by visiting a zoo or aquarium. Individuals can<br>

Plymouth Rock<br>
The Plymouth Rock is a chicken breed that originated in the United States in the 19th<br>
century and is still popular to this day. John C. Bennett (1804-1867) has been credited<br>
with either creating or popularizing the breed. They were developed in New England in<br>
the early 1800's by crossing Dominiques and Black Javas. It was bred as a dualpurpose fowl, meaning that it was valued both for its meat and the hens' egg-laying<br>
ability. A hen will lay between 50 and 100 eggs per year. It is a cold-hardy bird and<br>
therefore makes a great breed for the small farm or backyard flock owner. There are<br>
seven varieties of Plymouth Rock chickens: barred, blue, buff, Columbian, partridge,<br>
silver-penciled and white.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Wyandotte (any color)<br>
Wyandotte<br>
The Wyandotte is a medium sized breast with a rose comb and clean legs. The chicken<br>
feathers are broad and close fitting. The area around the vent is very fluffy. The legs are<br>
yellow. The Wyandotte is a breed that suits both free range and confinement in a run.<br>
The hens will lay around 200 eggs a year with an exceptional hen laying around 240<br>
eggs a year. The eggs are tinted.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Rhode Island Red<br>
Rhode Island Red<br>
Its feathers are a Mahogany dark red/brown lustre, bordering on black. Some have<br>
purple spots or green stripes. They have red/orange eyes and yellow feet. Chicks are a<br>
light red to tan color with two dark brown bars running down their backs. Rhode Island<br>
Reds are tough birds, resistant to illness, good at foraging and free ranging, and are<br>
typically docile, quiet and friendly. Though males can be considerably aggressive.<br>
Rhode Island Reds are excellent egg layers, producing up to 250 to 300 large, light<br>
brown eggs per year. Rhode Island Reds are also bred for meat, with Cockerels<br>
weighing in at around four kilograms, and Hens slightly less.<br>

Orpington<br>
The Orpington is a large bird from the English class of chickens. It is a bold, upright<br>
breed with a wide chest, broad back, and smallish head and tail. The Orpington was<br>
bred as a dual-purpose breed (meat production and eggs), but its popularity grew as a<br>
show bird rather than a utility breed. Their large size and soft appearance together with<br>
their rich color and gentle contours make them very attractive. Orpingtons lay between<br>
110 and 160 eggs a year. They do not stop laying in the winter. The eggs are tinted and<br>
range from small to large depending on the heredity of the breed.<br>

Leghorn<br>
Leghorns, and leghorn crossbreeds, are one of the most popular commercial breeds of<br>
chicken worldwide, and while the majority are white, a number of colored breeds also<br>
exist. Leghorns are excellent layers of white eggs (around 300 per year), but they can<br>
be noisy, flighty, easily excited, and aggressive. Because of their aggression, they are<br>
not recommended for backyard-operations. Leghorns mature quickly, but are generally<br>
neither considered to be large birds nor suitable for meat.<br>

qualities of each breed.<br>

The editors believe there is an error in the honor requirements. Peking Duck is a meal from<br>
Beijing (previously known as Peking). Pekin ducks are a breed of poultry.<br>
Pekin duck<br>
A Pekin duck is a breed of domesticated duck used primarily for egg and meat production.<br>
Bred from the Mallard in China, nine ducks were imported to the United States in 1873. It is<br>
the most popular commercial duck breed in the United States. These ducks are ready for<br>
butchering at 6 to 8 weeks of age and produce more meat that is desirable for eating than<br>
other breeds of duck. Its meat is very tender and mild and well-suited for many menu options.<br>
The eggs are slightly larger than a large chicken egg, and tend to have a more durable shell<br>
and stronger membrane which makes them harder to crack open than a chicken egg. Duck<br>
eggs have more protein, calcium and many vitamins, as well as more fat and cholesterol, per<br>
gram than a chicken egg. Duck eggs are very similar in flavor and texture to a chicken egg.<br>
They can usually be substituted for large or jumbo eggs in recipes. The mascot of the<br>
insurance company Aflac is a Pekin duck.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Identify by description and from pictures three breeds of large domestic fowl such<br>
as the following turkeys:<br>
This honor was first approved in 1928 and the three breeds listed in the requirement<br>
(Mammoth Bronze, White Holland, and Red Bourbon) are now considered &quot;heritage breeds&quot;<br>
and are no longer in regular commercial production after a push toward larger breasted, faster<br>
growing turkeys in the 1950's and onward. These heritage turkeys do still exist and are bred by<br>
enthusiasts, but information about them is difficult to come by. One estimate is that there are<br>
25,000 heritage turkeys to 200 million commercial turkey's a year raised.<br>
The scarceness of these breeds spills over to the Internet as well, making it very difficult to<br>
find photos released under a usable license. For this reason, if you can contribute photos to<br>
this project we certainly solicit you to do so. Until we have images with appropriate licenses,<br>
the best we can do is provide links to copyrighted photos elsewhere on the Internet.<br>
Since the requirement calls out &quot;three breeds of large domestic fowl such as&quot; it is perfectly<br>
acceptable to select more common breeds such such as the ones listed below the first three.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Mammoth Bronze turkey<br>
Mammoth Bronze turkey<br>
The Mammoth Bronze is similar to the wild turkey, but it is quite a bit larger. Its feathers<br>
are an iridescent black with hints of green. The feathers of the rump have bronze<br>
coloring (thus the name), while the feathers in the front have hints of red and green.<br>
It is calmer than most other breeds which makes them quite a bit easier to handle.<br>
Some people even use them as pets, though it is more common for them to be used for<br>
meat production. Toms weigh between 25 and 40 pounds, while hens weigh between<br>
14 and 26 pounds.<br>
The broad-breasted is more common than the &quot;unimproved&quot; variety. The large breast<br>
interferes with natural mating, so they must be artificially inseminated.<br>
For images of the Mammoth Bronze, search online.<br>

White Holland turkey<br>
The White Holland is the ancestor of the Broad-Breasted White, the most commonly<br>
produced breed of domestic turkey. True White Hollands are extremely rare these days<br>
and are bred primarily by enthusiasts. It has white feathers, pink feet, shanks, throat<br>
and wattle.<br>

Bourbon Red<br>
The Bourbon Red is a handsome breed of turkey with white feathers at its wing tips and<br>
tail, and brownish burgundy feathers covering most of the rest of its body. It has a<br>
bluish wattle, a black beard, and pink shanks and toes. The Red Bourbon is named for<br>
Bourbon County, Kentucky where the breed was developed in the late 1800's by J. F.<br>
Barbee. Recognized by the American Poultry Association in 1909, it became a<br>
commercially important breed in the 1930's and 1940's. Its decline is attributed to the<br>
popularity of broad-breasted varieties such as the Broad-breasted White.<br>

Broad Breasted White turkey<br>
The Broad Breasted White is commercially the most widely used breed of<br>
domesticated turkey. These birds have shorter breast bones and larger breasts,<br>
sometimes rendering them unable to breed without human assistance (typically via<br>
artificial insemination). They produce more breast meat and their pin feathers are less<br>
visible when the carcass is dressed due to their white color. These properties have<br>
made the breed popular in commercial turkey production.<br>
These birds are grown in large, fully automated grow-out barns, which may house as<br>
many as 10,000 birds. The growing process for these birds has been so well refined,<br>
the birds often grow to larger than 50 lbs. Average birds are typically 38-40 lbs.<br>
Because of their size, they are prone to health problems associated with being<br>
overweight (due to excess muscle), such as heart disease, respiratory failure and joint<br>
damage; even if such turkeys are spared from slaughter, they usually have short lives<br>
as a result.<br>
Ocellated turkey<br>
The Ocellated turkey is a domestic relative of the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo).<br>
The ocellated turkey lives only in a 130,000 km2 (50,000 sq mi) range in the Yucatán<br>
Peninsula in Mexico—which includes all or part the states of Quintana Roo, Campeche,<br>
Yucatán, Tabasco, and Chiapas—as well as the northern parts of Belize and Guatemala.<br>
The body feathers of both sexes are a mixture of bronze and green iridescent color.<br>
Although females can be duller with more green, the breast feathers do not generally<br>
differ and can not be used to determine sex. Neither sex possesses the beard typically<br>
found in wild turkeys. Tail feathers of both sexes are bluish-grey with an eye-shaped,<br>
blue-bronze spot near the end with a bright gold tip. The spots, or ocelli (located on the<br>
tail), for which the ocellated turkey is named, have been likened to the patterning<br>
typically found on peafowl. The upper, major secondary wing coverts are rich iridescent<br>
copper. The primary and secondary wing feathers have similar barring to that of North<br>
American turkeys, but the secondaries have more white, especially around the edges.<br>
Both sexes have blue heads with some orange or red nodules, which are more<br>
pronounced on males. The males also have a fleshy blue crown covered with nodules,<br>
similar to those on the neck, behind the snood. During breeding season this crown<br>
swells up and becomes brighter and more pronounced in its yellow-orange color. The<br>
eye is surrounded by a ring of bright red skin, which is most visible on males during<br>
breeding season. The legs are deep red and are shorter and thinner than on North<br>
American turkeys. Males over one year old have spurs on the legs that average 4 cm<br>
(1.6 in), which lengths of over 6 cm (2.4 in) being recorded. These spurs are much<br>
longer and thinner than on North American turkeys.<br>
Ocellated turkeys are much smaller than any of the subspecies of North American wild<br>
turkey, with adult hens weighing about 4 kg (8.8 lb) before laying eggs and 3 kg (6–7<br>
pounds) the rest of the year, and adult males weighing about 5–6 kg (11–13 lb) during<br>
breeding season.<br>
Black turkey<br>
The Black, sometimes referred to as the Black Spanish or the Norfolk Black, is a breed<br>
of domestic turkey. The Black was developed in Europe from the Aztec turkeys<br>
originally brought from Mexico by Spanish explorers. Despite the monikers of “Spanish<br>
and “Norfolk” (England), birds of this type live in many European nations. Originally,<br>
black colored turkeys were a relative rarity among New World flocks, but Europeans<br>
heavily selected for this trait until it became predominant. The &quot;Norfolk Black&quot; is<br>
generally considered the oldest turkey breed in the UK<br>
Black turkeys were sent in the holds of ships on the transatlantic crossing from Europe<br>
to the New World, and were raised by early colonists. Ironically, it is likely that the turkey<br>
consumed at the first Thanksgiving meal may have actually been from European birds,<br>
rather than wild turkeys native to the continent.<br>
Later, Blacks were crossed with the wild turkey to help produce breeds such as the<br>
Bronze, Narragansett, and Slate. They remained a commercially farmed variety in the<br>
U.S. until the early 20th century, but fell out of favor after the development of the Broad<br>
Breasted Bronze and Broad Breasted White. Fairly common in Europe, they are<br>
considered an endangered variety of heritage turkey today by the American Livestock<br>
Breeds Conservancy.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Toulouse goose<br>
Toulouse goose<br>
The Toulouse goose has greyish-brown feathers on top, with white feathers<br>
underneath. The most distinguishing characteristic is a pronounced <em>dewlap</em>, which is a<br>
flap of loose skin beneath the chin. The bird is of a very trusting nature and has a very<br>
placid disposition, with the consequence that these birds do not thrive in flocks of<br>
mixed breeds. The more active and aggressive breeds will greatly distress the bird,<br>
putting them of mating and sometimes resulting in them losing out at the feeding<br>
trough. They are very domestic birds and will easily be bewildered by more active<br>
breeds if mixed. They do not need water or a pond and the geese never mate in water.<br>
They rarely have problems producing fertile eggs, although problems can occur during<br>
severe weather in the winter and spring, which is the case with most breeds of geese.<br>
The breed is a good layer of eggs and will equal the best of any goose breed. A good<br>
goose will lay up to 100 eggs a year. However the birds are not good sitters, the sitting<br>
habit having been bred out of some birds. The breed makes an excellent table bird. The<br>
geese are not great wanderers and preferring to stay close to home making them ideal<br>
for a large garden or an orchard where the birds will thrive.<br>

Embden Goose<br>
The breed is pure white with a light orange, short, bill, and orange feet and shanks.<br>
They are fast growing birds and will quickly reach about 20lb for the Goose, and 30lb<br>
for the Gander. The Embden's legs are fairly short. The head is oval-shaped and they<br>
have a long and graceful neck. The eyes are blue. The body is bulky and well rounded,<br>
having a long back and a short tail. The wings are very strong and of a good length.<br>
The feathers are close and very hard. The breed’s habits are to forage for tidbits in the<br>
grass and water. They are a very hardy breed. The adult bird will commence laying eggs<br>
fairly early in the year, in February as a rule, laying 30 to 40 eggs. The bird is an<br>
excellent table bird.<br>

Chinese Goose<br>
The Chinese Goose is a domesticated version of the Swan Goose. Sexes are similar,<br>
although the male is larger. The voice is a loud honking. It grazes on sedges, and rarely<br>
swims. It forms small flocks outside the breeding season. Some domesticated,<br>
introduced, or feral populations may be completely white. Some variations have a<br>
&quot;bump&quot; or &quot;knob&quot; at the top of the beak, which is more prominent on males than<br>
females. By 6–8 weeks of age, the knob is already pronounced enough that it can be<br>
used for sexing. A female goose usually lays 50–60 eggs over the course of the<br>
breeding season (February through June), although there are reports of Chinese geese<br>
laying up to 100 eggs during that time.<br>

Sebastopol Goose<br>
The Sebastopol is a medium-sized goose with long, white curly feathers. The feathers<br>
of the neck are greyish-brown and smooth. Feathers on the breast may be curly or<br>
smooth. It is best to avoid breeding two specimens both having curly breast feathers,<br>
as they will develop abnormal wings. The gander weighs 12-14 lbs while the goose<br>
weighs 10-12 lbs. The legs and shanks are orange and the eyes bright blue. The breed<br>
was developed in Europe along the Danube and the Black Sea. Sebastopols cannot fly<br>
well due to the curliness of their feathers. They need plenty of water in order to keep<br>
themselves clean. For photos, see the following:<br>

The Cape Barren Goose is a large goose resident in southern Australia. These are bulky<br>
geese and their almost uniformly grey plumage, bearing rounded black spots, is unique.<br>
The tail and flight feathers are blackish and the legs are pink with black feet. The short,<br>
decurved black bill and green cere gives it a very peculiar expression.<br>
The Cape Barren Goose is 75-100 cm long, and has a 150-190 cm wingspan; males are<br>
somewhat larger than females. The male weighs on average 5.29 kg and the female<br>
3.77 kg.<br>
This bird feeds by grazing and rarely swims. It forms small flocks outside the breeding<br>
season, when it wanders more widely.<br>

of poultry observed.<br>
An Agricultural Fair is commonly known as a State Fair or a County Fair in the United States. A<br>
state fair is a competitive and recreational gathering of a U.S. state's population. It is a larger<br>
version of a county fair, often including only exhibits or competitors that have won in their<br>
categories at the more-local county fairs.<br>
Originally a state fair was just a competitive exhibition of livestock in various competitions,<br>
the display of farm products which were not necessarily for sale, and the competition among<br>
various fair goers and participants in such categories as handicrafts, baked goods, jams and<br>
jellies, etc., but has since been expanded to include carnival amusement rides and games,<br>
music, races, tests of strength and skill, etc. Large fairs can see more than a million visitors<br>
over the course of a week or two.<br>
Attending a fair like this can be a very enjoyable experience for your Pathfinders. You can find<br>
a list of state fairs in the Wikipedia article on </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">State Fairs</span><span style="color:#212529;">. Most of this Honor can be<br>

When the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, we see a lunar eclipse, which is the Earth's shadow falling on the moon. When the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth, we see a solar eclipse, which is when the Moon's shadow falls on the Earth (blocking the Sun).<br>

A meteor is any celestial body (usually quite small) that falls to the Earth. Most burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the surface, leaving a bright, short-lived streak in the sky.<br>

In one year, light will travel 5.88 trillion miles (9.4 trillion km). This distance is also called a light-year. How far is that?<br>
Earth orbits the sun at an average of 92,955,807 miles (149,597,870 km). This distance from Earth to the sun is called an astronomical unit, or AU. It takes light from the Sun about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to cover the distance from the Sun to the Earth. There are 63,239 AUs in a light-year since light can travel 63,239 times further in an Earth year than it takes to get from the Sun to Earth. AUs are easy to work with in our solar system. Jupiter, for example, is 5.2 AU from the Sun or 5.2 times further from the Sun than the Earth is, while Neptune is 30.07 AU from the Sun.<br>
However, when you move outside our solar system the distances get much larger. The distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is about 268,770 AU and the numbers get bigger from there. To express such long distances, astronomers use the light-year.<br>
At 63,239 AU to the light year, that closest star Proxima Centauri is about 4.25 lightyears away, which means it takes 4.25 of our years for its light to reach our eyes. When we star gaze we are really looking back in time.<br>
In 2016 scientists announced they found a galaxy they called GN-z11 which they estimate is 32 Billion light-years away. If you ever wondered if God and his creation is really eternal without beginning or end, think about the fact God created a galaxy before 32 Billion years ago.<br>

One may demonstrate by using an orange, walnut, and marble, or similar objects, to show positions and movements of the earth, sun, and moon when there is an eclipse of the sun and when there is an eclipse of the moon.<br>
Place the &quot;sun&quot; model in the center. Place the &quot;earth&quot; some distance from the sun, and show how it travels in a near circle around the sun. The moon travels around the earth, but it always shows the same face to the earth (it's rotation on its axis takes the same amount of time as its orbit around the earth.<br>

Pluto was also considered a planet from 1930 until 2006 when the International Astronomer's Union (IAU) was prompted by the discovery Eris, a body larger than Pluto, to come up with a formal definition of the word &quot;planet.&quot; For years leading up to this announcement there had been rumblings in the scientific community that classifying Pluto as a planet had been a mistake, much as the classification of Ceres, the largest asteroid <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">Finding Polaris<br>

After the discovery of Ceres, more and more asteroids were discovered, and it became increasingly clear that it was not a planet. The same thing began to happen in the late 1900's when astronomers began to discover several Pluto-like objects in the Kuiper belt. The debate came to a head with the discovery of Eris, which has a diameter that exceeds Pluto's by 70 miles (110 km). The IAU would have to either recognize Eris as the tenth planet or &quot;demote&quot; Pluto. The demotion of Pluto, though not popular with the general public, makes the most scientific sense and demonstrates that science is capable of correcting its errors.<br>
The new definition of a planet requires that an object a) orbit a star (such as the Sun), b) not orbit another planet (such as a satellite), and c) dominate the vicinity of its orbit. Pluto did not make the cut because its orbit is dominated by Neptune, and there are many objects orbiting in its vicinity that Pluto has no effect upon.<br>
There are a number of mnemonic phrases that are easily memorized for remembering the names of the planets, including &quot;My Very Energetic Mother Just Served Us Noodles.<br>

The word <em>planet </em>means <em>wanderer </em>because the planets appear to wander about the sky relative to the stars. The stars do not move in relation to one another (although they all appear to move together because of the Earth's rotation on its axis).<br>
Which eight stars you choose to teach your Pathfinders to identify will depend on the season (spring, summer, winter, or fall), although some stars are visible year-round.<br>

Arcturus can be found in the summer by following the arc made by handle of the Big Dipper (away from the dipper's bowl).<br>

A constellation is any one of the 88 areas into which the sky - or the celestial sphere – is divided. The term is also often used less formally to denote a group of stars visibly related to each other in a particular configuration or pattern.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Ursa Major<br>

Use the instructions given previously for finding Polaris, which is the end of the Little Dipper's handle. Unfortunately, the stars that make up Ursa Minor are relatively dim, making this one a bit more difficult to find.<br>

The Summer Triangle, including, Deneb (in Cygnus), Vega (in Lyra), and Altair (in Aquila) Cygnus, Altair, and Lyra.<br>
These are easily identified summer constellations. The brightest stars in each of these three make up the Summer Triangle. Once the stars are found, it is easy to find the constellations they are part of. Vega is the brightest star in the Summer Triangle, and it is a member of the constellation Lyra. Cygnus is also known as the Northern Cross. The triangle is completed by Altair which is a member of the constellation Aquila.<br>
The Winter Circle is made up of several bright stars visible in the Northern hemisphere's winter. The easiest constellation to find in the Winter Circle is Orion. Following Orion's belt will lead to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky and a member of Canis Major (the &quot;big dog&quot;). Canis Minor (the &quot;little dog&quot;) is clockwise from Sirius. Continuing clockwise, we come to Gemini, Auriga, and Taurus.<br>

The North Star never appears to move at all, and it can be found due north. The Big Dipper and Cassiopeia will rotate around the North Star (also known as Polaris, since it is directly above the North Pole). When drawing the diagram, be sure to include the seven stars in the Big Dipper, the five in Cassiopeia, and the North Star.<br>
Make sure that the two stars at the end of the Big Dipper's &quot;bowl&quot; point to the North Star. Cassiopeia should be shaped like a somewhat flattened &quot;W&quot;.<br>

It would be possible to draw them all on a single diagram, but since Orion is on the other side of the sky from the other two, you'd end up drawing an awful lot of sky. Therefore, it should be acceptable to draw these three on independent diagrams.<br>

Morning Star and Evening Star from mythology. Venus never appears on the opposite horizon<br>
from the sun due to its relative location to the sun and Earth. Mercury too fits this profile but is<br>
rarely actually visible.<br>

If you extend a line from the zenith to the point on Earth upon which you are standing, and continue that line through the Earth and out the other side, it would point to the nadir. In other words, nadir is the direction pointing directly below a particular location. The line connecting the zenith and nadir passes through the point on Earth where you're standing and also passes through the center of the Earth and out the other side.<br>

The immediate causes of aurora are precipitating energetic particles. These particles are electrons and protons that are energized in the near geospace environment. This energization process draws its energy from the interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Describe the ways in which trees and shrubs differ.<br>
Trees are generally taller than shrubs and have a main trunk from which all the secondary<br>
branches grow. Shrubs are generally shorter and may have multiple stems rather than a single<br>
trunk. Some plants can be considered either shrubs or trees depending on their growing<br>
conditions, so the division should not be considered exact.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Collect and identify typical leaves from 15 different species of trees. Spread<br>
neatly, press dry, mount, and label in a suitable notebook or on uniform-size<br>
sheets of paper.<br>
Unless you are already very familiar with the trees in your area, you will need to get a field<br>
guide on trees for this activity. Illustrating all the tree species you may encounter is well<br>
beyond the scope of a single chapter in an answer book!<br>
It is best to collect the leaves in the spring or early summer before insects and weather have<br>
had a chance to damage them, but if you prefer, you can try to collect them in the fall when the<br>
colors change.<br>
When you go out collecting, take the field guide with you. It is important to identify the leaves<br>
as you collect them, as you can look at more than just the leaves for identification. The bark,<br>
environment, buds, and shape of the tree are all important clues to the tree's species. This is<br>
especially important if you wish to differentiate trees of the same genus (such as black cherry,<br>
pin cherry, choke cherry, etc.).Indeed, proper identification may not be possible from just the<br>
leaf.<br>
Collect leaves that are typical for the tree, but remember - smaller leaves are going to be<br>
easier to fit onto an 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper.<br>
Press the leaves by placing them on some sort of absorbent paper - newspaper, paper towels,<br>
tissues, etc. Then place these under a stack of books or in a leaf press. After two weeks, the<br>
leaves should be flattened, dried, and well-preserved. Evergreens such as spruce and fir are<br>
difficult to preserve this way as the needles will fall off. The more ambitious may wish to<br>
encase the leaves in epoxy, as this preserves the color and eliminates the need for pressing<br>
(meaning the leaves also retain their three dimensional features).<br>
Once the leaves have been pressed, you can glue, tape, or laminate them onto notebook<br>
paper. Use loose-leaf if you wish to rearrange them later. You may also place the pressed<br>
leaves between two sheets of wax paper, cover with a towel, and iron.<br>

Sweet Gum: the gummy sap of this tree has been used as chewing gum.<br>
Cork Oak forms a thick, rugged and corky bark. Over time this bark can develop<br>
considerable thickness, and this is harvested every 10-12 years as cork.<br>
Balsam Fir: produces a resin which is known as <em>Canadian Balsam</em>. A balsam is the<br>
same thing as a balm, a soothing liquid - anything that soothes, heals, or restores.<br>
Boxwood: produces a tight-grained wood ideal for carving or for making boxes.<br>

Mountain Ash grow in the mountainous areas of the northern US and Canada.<br>
Swamp Ash live in the swamps of the southern US.<br>

Sugar Maple: The primary source of sugary maple syrup.<br>
Hornbeam: The common English name of &quot;hornbeam&quot; derives from the hardness<br>
of the wood (likened to horn) and the Old English beam, meaning a tree (like the<br>
German word &quot;baum&quot; which we know as &quot;tannenbaum&quot;).<br>
Tulip Tree: is so named because its flowers resemble tulip flowers.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3d </span><span style="color:#212529;">The geographic region in which they live<br>
Brazilwood: is not named after Brazil - Brazil is actually named for the tree!<br>
Cedar of Lebanon, is a coniferous tree native to the mountains of the<br>
Mediterranean region, in Lebanon, western Syria and south central Turkey<br>
Mexican Buckeye is a shrub or small tree native to northeastern Mexico and<br>
adjacent western Texas and southern New Mexico.<br>

Douglas Fir: The common name honors David Douglas, the Scottish botanist who<br>
first introduced the tree into cultivation in 1826.<br>
Fraser Fir: named after John Fraser, a Scottish botanist. Fraser Firs are farmed and<br>
sold as Christmas trees.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Give the common name and tell the difference between the two great classes of<br>
trees.<br>
The two great classes of trees are the gymnosperms and angiosperms. The gymnosperms do<br>
not produce flowers, but rather, produce naked seeds usually attached to the scale of a cone<br>
(such as a pine cone). The angiosperms do produce flowers which in turn become seedbearing fruits (or nuts). More commonly, the gymnosperms are called <em>evergreens</em>, though this<br>
is not an accurate term because some angiosperms are evergreen (such as palms and the<br>
live oak). Also, the Ginkgo is a gymnosperm, but it is not evergreen. Gymnosperms and<br>
angiosperms are also commonly referred to as <em>softwoods </em>and <em>hardwoods </em>though those terms<br>
are not terribly accurate either, as several gymnosperms have hard wood and several<br>
angiosperms have soft wood.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Describe the importance of forest conservation in your area.<br>
Properly managed, forests are a renewable resource. In order to ensure a continuous supply<br>
of forest products (such as lumber), forests must be properly cut and replanted. Forests also<br>
serve as an important habitat for several species, both animal and plant. When plants lose<br>
their habitat they simply die. When animals lose their habitat, some will die and others will<br>
move into other areas - notably, areas where humans live. This promotes undesirable<br>
encounters between potentially dangerous animals and humans, with the animal invariably<br>
getting the short end of the stick.<br>

The American Manual Alphabet is a manual alphabet that augments the vocabulary of<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">American Sign Language </span><span style="color:#212529;">when spelling individual letters of a word is the preferred or only<br>
option, such as with proper names or the titles of works. Letters should be signed with the<br>
dominant hand and in most cases, with palm facing the viewer.<br>

The ASL alphabet is based on an old Spanish manual alphabet that dates back to at least the<br>
seventeenth century.<br>
It is used with minor modification in Paraguay, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong,<br>
Taiwan, and Singapore. The Asian countries just listed modify the T, for the ASL T is<br>
considered obscene. Instead, they use the T of the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Irish manual alphabet</span><span style="color:#212529;">, which is like an ASL<br>
X, but with the thumb tucked into the index finger (that is, the index finger wraps around the tip<br>
of the thumb). In Thailand, one indicates points on the left hand for the tone and vowel marks<br>
of the Thai alphabet, and aspiration is not indicated. The Paraguay alphabet is identical to<br>
ASL, except for the addition of the letter Ñ, which is an N swiveled at the wrist so that the<br>
fingers move side to side, and the letters LL and RR, which are L and R plus movement to the<br>
side.<br>
It is also used in Germany, Austria, Norway, and Finland, again with a modification for the<br>
letter T. T is like G with the thumb placed atop the first knuckle of the index finger.<br>
German Ä, Ö, Ü, and ß are signed like A, O, U, and S but with a downward motion, while SCH is<br>
a 5 hand (palm forward). In Norwegian and Finnish, the letters Ä, Å, Ö, Ø are derived by moving<br>
A and O (in the case of Å, in a small window-washing circular motion), and it is the Æ that gets<br>
the 5 hand (perhaps somewhat flexed).<br>
Good form<br>
The hand should either remain in place while fingerspelling, or more often, drift slightly<br>
away from the midline in the manner of text being written out in the air; although, this is a<br>
subtle movement and should not be exaggerated.<br>
If fingerspelling multiple words or entire sentences, there should be a very brief pause<br>
between terms so as to signify the beginning and ending of individual words.<br>
Long nails or excessive jewelry can be distracting when watching fingerspelling and for<br>
this reason people who regularly use sign language usually avoid them.<br>
When fingerspelling acronyms in American Sign Language, such as with FBI, NASA, or RID<br>
(Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf), the letters are often moved in a small circle to<br>
emphasize that they should not be read together as a word.<br>
Additionally, when fingerspelling the hand should not bounce between letters. An<br>
exception is the case of double letters as with the word <em>carry </em>in which the double <em>R </em>can be<br>
shown by slightly bouncing the corresponding handshape, or by dragging it, slightly, to the<br>
side. Either method is a correct way to show double letters. However, people who bounce<br>
between every letter produce fingerspelling that is very hard to watch or understand.<br>
Those who cannot overcome the habit of bouncing every letter may find it helpful to hold<br>
the wrist of the hand doing the fingerspelling with the free hand so that they are forced to<br>
keep the hand from moving up and down while fingerspelling. Usually, only a few hours or<br>
days of this is enough to break the habit of unnecessary bouncing while fingerspelling.<br>
Common mistakes<br>
Many mistakes made by beginning fingerspellers are directly attributable to how the manual<br>
alphabet is most often shown in graphics.<br>
Letters<br>
In most drawings or illustrations of the American Manual Alphabet, some of the letters are<br>
depicted from the side to better illustrate the desired handshape; however in practice, the<br>
hand should not be turned to the side when producing the letter. The letters <em>C </em>and <em>O </em>are two<br>
that are often mistakenly turned to the side by beginners who become used to seeing them<br>
from the side in illustrations. Important exceptions to the rule that the palm should always be<br>
facing the viewer are the letters <em>G </em>and <em>H</em>. These two letters should be made, not with the palm<br>
facing the viewer or the speaker, but with the palm facing sideways - the hand in an<br>
ergonomically neutral position.<br>
Numbers<br>
Another mistake made by people faithfully following the pictures in most illustrations of the<br>
ASL fingerspelling alphabet is the signing of the cardinal numbers <em>1 - 5 </em>with the palm facing<br>
out. The cardinal numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 should be signed palm in (towards the signer). This<br>
is in contrast with the cardinal numbers 6-9 which should be produced with the palm turned to<br>
face the person being addressed.<br>
As with the letter <em>O</em>, the zero should not be turned to the side, but shown palm facing forward.<br>
This applies only to the cardinal numbers however. Using numbers in other situations, such as<br>
with for showing the digits of the time for example, has different rules. When signing the time,<br>
the numbers are always facing the person being addressed, even the numbers one through<br>
five. Other signing situations involving numbers have their own norms that must be learned on<br>
a case by case basis.<br>
Rhythm, speed &amp; movement<br>
When fingerspelling, your hand should be at shoulder height, and should not 'bounce' with<br>
each letter. Your hand should stay in one place and only the handshape changes (and<br>
orientation for some letters). If you have trouble doing this, you might want to hold your<br>
forearm with your nondominant hand in order to force your spelling hand to stay still.<br>
'Bouncing' the letters makes your fingerspelling difficult to read, even for native signers.<br>
As well, clear handshapes are much easier to read than fast fingerspelling. Do not concentrate<br>
on speed, as fast fingerspelling with poorly formed handshapes will be difficult to read. Try to<br>
fingerspell the whole word at the same speed, not speeding up or slowing down. A pause<br>
indicates the beginning of a new word, so if you suddenly slow down because a letter<br>
combination is difficult, your reader may think you are starting a new word, leading to<br>
misunderstanding. An exception to this sometimes appears at the beginning of a word. The<br>
first letter may be held for the length of a letter extra as a cue that the signer is about to start<br>
fingerspelling.<br>

Where do you find a sign language instructor? First, if you know a deaf person or someone<br>
who knows how to sign, ask them for a referral. If that doesn't work out, check with a local<br>
high school guidance counselor. They may be able to direct you to either a free or for-pay<br>
program. You can also check into a local social services organization, as many offer sign<br>
language classes for free.<br>
Ideally, you will have a volunteer instructor come to instruct your club, but you may need to be<br>
flexible. Your club may need to come to the instructor. If only a few people in your club are<br>
interested, you should join a class that meets outside of Pathfinder time. If you invite an<br>
instructor to teach at your club, be sure to tell her how many students to expect before you<br>
ask for a commitment.<br>
Once you find a class and instruction begins, we <em>highly </em>recommend that you take <em>five </em>hours of<br>
instruction as required in the Advanced honor rather than just the three required. It will be a lot<br>
easier to continue instruction until you have all five hours as opposed to resuming classes<br>
sometime in the future.<br>

minimum of 25 letters.<br>
Tips<br>
When you are first learning to sign the letters, a good Bible text to practice with is Philippians<br>
4:8, as it repeats the phrase &quot;whatever is&quot; several times. Since it is so repetitive, You should be<br>
able to quickly sign the &quot;whatever is&quot; portion to get your speed up. This verse contains all the<br>
letters of the alphabet except j, q, and z which can be learned afterwards. Learning a text such<br>
as this will also force you to learn each letter on its own (as opposed to always signing K after<br>
J). Once a text such as this one has been learned you may be surprised that you can finger<br>
spell just about anything.<br>
Graphically<br>
We present this Bible verse graphically here, showing the first 108 letters of the verse. If you<br>
can sign this in under 4 minutes 20, seconds, you will have achieved 5 words per minute<br>
(assuming an average of 5 letters per word).<br>

Ameslan, or American Sign Language, has little connection to English grammar. This<br>
language was developed by the deaf community as an efficient and expressive method<br>
of communication. Signed English, on the other hand, was designed with a more direct<br>
connection to English grammar, the theory being that knowing it would make reading<br>
and writing in English easier. Signed English follows the same word order and syntax<br>
as spoken English, while the word order in Ameslan is conceptually-based.<br>

The goliath bird eating spider (also called the<br>
birdeater) (<em>Theraphosa blondi</em>) is an arachnid<br>
belonging to the tarantula family and is the largest<br>
spider in the world. The spider was named by<br>
explorers from the Victorian era, who witnessed<br>
one eating a hummingbird and reported the<br>
sighting to the Western world.<br>
The largest ever found had a leg-span of more than<br>
28cm .<br>

notoriety in your region.<br>
The spider would depend on where you live. Use the suggested resources and your local<br>
library for books on spiders of your area. You may also wish to use an Internet search engine,<br>
and search for something like &quot;notorious spider&quot; and the name of your region, country, or<br>
continent.<br>

Spiders have 8 legs while insects only have 6.<br>
Spiders have singular eyes with lenses and insects have compound eyes.<br>
Spiders don't have antennas and insects do.<br>
Spiders have bodies with two parts: combined head and thorax called the cephalothorax, and<br>
the abdomen; insects have bodies with three body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen.<br>

Emphasize that even though there are some poisonous spiders, except for a few rare<br>
cases, they bite humans only in self-defense. The human race needs spiders in order to<br>
survive.<br>

Spiders are predators and so they eat flies and other small annoying insects. Many of<br>
these insects destroy our crops and gardens. Other insects caught in their webs can<br>
cause disease in humans.<br>
Dust mites live in our homes and eat the dead skin that comes off our bodies. Many<br>
people are allergic to dust mites. Spiders eat the Dust Mites, thereby assisting in<br>
allergen control.<br>
Spiders are an integral part of the food chain. Because the spider eats and is eaten, it<br>
helps to keep the ecosystem balanced. Without spiders the ecosystem would become<br>
imbalanced, seriously damaging many living things, including humans.<br>

Some spiders are venomous. Their bites can range from painful to deadly if the correct<br>
treatment is not used within a short time after the bite.<br>
Most people are afraid of spiders, so if a property has either too many spiders or<br>
poisonous spiders, it would be hard to sell that property.<br>
Spiders make webs in unwelcome places, like corners of rooms or between limbs of<br>
trees over a path. These webs cause us to spend time and money removing them.<br>
Their webs also trap dust that can cause an allergic reaction in some people.<br>

and one with a standard transmission. Explain why it is necessary for the engine<br>
to have the proper oil, water, fuel, and battery pressures and levels for proper<br>
engine operation.<br>
Starting an Automatic<br>
To start a vehicle with an automatic transmission, sit in the driver's seat and make sure the<br>
vehicle is in <em>Park</em>. Insert the key in the ignition and turn it clockwise as far as it will go. The<br>
engine should crank. Do not depress the gas pedal. As soon as the engine starts, release the<br>
key. To turn it off, turn the key counter-clockwise.<br>
Starting a Manual<br>
To start a vehicle with a manual transmission, sit in the driver's seat and push the clutch pedal<br>
all the way in with the left foot. The clutch pedal is the third one from the right, and this is<br>
often the one farthest to the left (although some vehicles have the parking brake to the left of<br>
the clutch).<br>
Make sure the parking brake has been applied. Inexperienced drivers should also shift the<br>
vehicle into neutral so that if the foot slips off the clutch after the engine starts, the car does<br>
not move. Even with the vehicle in neutral, it is still important to depress the clutch, as many<br>
autos have a switch in the clutch which prevents the engine from starting unless the clutch is<br>
depressed. Insert the key in the ignition and turn it clockwise as far as it will go. The engine<br>
should crank. Do not depress the gas pedal, but leave the clutch pedal depressed. As soon as<br>
the engine starts, release the key. To turn it off, turn the key counter-clockwise.<br>
Importance of Proper Pressures and Levels<br>
Oil keeps the engine lubricated and reduces friction between the moving parts of the engine.<br>
Friction causes heat, so if there is insufficient oil pressure in the engine, it will quickly<br>
overheat. Running an engine without oil for any amount of time will damage it, and doing so<br>
for an extended period will destroy it.<br>
Water circulates through the engine to cool it. Running an engine too hot will damage it.<br>
Fuel is what makes the engine go. If the vehicle has insufficient fuel pressure, the fuel will not<br>
flow into the combustion chamber at the proper rate.<br>
The Battery provides energy to run the engine's starter. If the battery's voltage level is low, it<br>
may not be able to turn the starter.<br>

gasoline and diesel engines. Explain the major differences between carburetor<br>
fuel systems and fuel-injection systems.<br>
Four-cycle Engine<br>
A four-cycle engine is so named because it makes four strokes to<br>
generate power. These strokes are as follows:<br>
1. Intake Stroke: During this stroke, the piston draws a mixture of fuel<br>
and air into the cylinder. The fuel and air enters through an intake<br>
valve which opens during this stroke.<br>
2. Compression Stroke: Once the fuel and air have been drawn into<br>
the cylinder, the intake valve close and the piston returns towards<br>
the engine's head. This compresses the fuel.<br>
3. Power Stroke: When the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the<br>
spark plug fires, igniting the compressed fuel and air mixture and<br>
causing an explosion. This explosion causes the gases to expand<br>
which powers the piston downwards again. This is where the<br>
engines power (and noise!) comes from.<br>
4. Exhaust Stroke: When the piston reaches the bottom of the cylinder,<br>
the exhaust valve opens, and as the piston returns to the top of the cylinder again, the<br>
exhaust gases are pushed out. When the cylinder reaches the top again, the four cycles<br>
are ready to repeat.<br>
Two-cycle Engine<br>
Power and Exhaust Stroke: In a two-cycle engine, the spark plug fires<br>
every time the piston reaches the top of the cylinder. This is the<br>
beginning of the power and exhaust cycle. As in the four cycle engine,<br>
the spark plug firing causes a compressed air/fuel mixture in the<br>
cylinder to explode, and the expanding gases drive the piston<br>
downward. As the cylinder goes down, it compresses another air/fuel<br>
mixture inside the <em>crankcase </em>- not inside the cylinder as in the fourstroke engine. The crankcase is the area beneath the piston, and the<br>
cylinder is the area above the piston. When the piston nears the<br>
bottom of this stroke, it uncovers an exhaust outlet and it also<br>
uncovers a passage between the crankcase and the cylinder. The<br>
compressed air-fuel mixture in the crankcase then rushes through this<br>
passage-way into the cylinder, forcing the exhaust gases out of the cylinder though the<br>
exhaust outlet. Some of the air/fuel mixture is <em>also </em>forced out the exhaust outlet, and this<br>
unfortunately decreases the engine's fuel efficiency and increases its pollution output. The<br>
piston's head is shaped in such a way as to minimize this waste, but it does not entirely<br>
eliminate it.<br>
Intake and Compression Stroke: After the piston reaches the bottom of the stroke, it begins<br>
traveling upwards again, compressing the air/fuel mixture that rushed into the cylinder from<br>
the crankcase during the previous stroke, and simultaneously drawing <em>more </em>air and fuel into<br>
the crankcase. By the time the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the air/fuel mixture is<br>
very highly compressed - much more compressed than it was in the crankcase. It is at this<br>
point in the cycle that the intake valve closes and the spark plug fires.<br>
Because the crankcase is opened to the cylinder during its operation, oil in the crankcase<br>
makes its way into the cylinder where it is compressed and combusted along with the fuel. If<br>
this situation were ignored, the engine would soon burn up all its oil, leaving itself<br>
unlubricated. The engine would soon get so hot that its parts would fuse together and destroy<br>
itself. This is addressed by adding oil to the fuel (often one part oil to sixteen parts fuel). Thus<br>
the engine's oil supply is refreshed on every stroke of the piston. This unfortunately increases<br>
the pollution levels generated by two-stroke engines.<br>
Gasoline verses Diesel Engines<br>
In many respects, the four-stroke gasoline engine and the four-stroke diesel engine are very<br>
similar. They both follow an operating cycle that consists of intake, compression, power, and<br>
exhaust strokes. They also share in the same system for intake and exhaust valves. The fuel<br>
and air mixture is ignited by the heat generated by the compression stroke in a diesel engine<br>
Crankshaft, connecting rods, and four<br>
pistons<br>
versus the use of a spark ignition system on a gasoline engine. The diesel engine needs no<br>
ignition system. For this reason, the gasoline engine is referred to as a spark ignition engine<br>
and a diesel engine is referred to as a compression ignition engine.<br>
The fuel and air mixture is compressed to about one-twentieth of its original volume in a<br>
diesel engine. In contrast, the fuel and air mixture in a gasoline engine is compressed to about<br>
one-eighth of its original volume. The diesel engine must compress the mixture this tightly to<br>
generate enough heat to ignite the fuel and air mixture.<br>
The gasoline engine mixes the fuel and air before it reaches the combustion chamber. A<br>
diesel engine takes in only air through the intake port. Fuel is put into the combustion<br>
chamber directly through an injection system. The air and fuel then mix in the combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
The engine speed and the power output of a diesel engine are controlled by the quantity of<br>
fuel admitted to the combustion chamber. The amount of air is constant. This contrasts with<br>
the gasoline engine where the speed and power output are regulated by limiting the air<br>
entering the engine.<br>
Carburetor verses Fuel Injection Systems<br>
The carburetor serves the following basic functions:<br>
1. The carburetor mixes fuel and air Into the correct proportions for the most efficient use by<br>
the engine. The carburetor also must constantly vary the mixture proportions to meet the<br>
engine’s needs as Its speed and load requirements vary.<br>
2. The carburetor regulates engine speed and power output.<br>
3. The carburetor atomizes the fuel as it mixes it with the air.<br>
Fuel injection systems are an increasingly popular alternative to the carburetor for providing<br>
an air-fuel mixture. They inject, under pressure, a measured amount of fuel into the Intake air,<br>
usually at a point near the intake valve. Fuel injection systems provide the following<br>
advantages.<br>
1. Fuel delivery can be measured with extreme accuracy, giving the potential for improved<br>
fuel economy and performance.<br>
2. Because the fuel is injected at the intake port of each cylinder, fuel distribution will be<br>
much better and fuel condensing in the manifold will not be a problem.<br>
3. The fuel injector, working under pressure, can atomize the fuel much finer than the<br>
carburetor, resulting in improved fuel vaporization.<br>

function of these units:<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Engine: crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, camshaft, valves, oil pump,<br>
carburetor, fuel injectors, ignition distributor, fuel distributor, electrical<br>
system including alternator, battery, and regulator<br>
As can be seen in the diagram to the right,<br>
the pistons drive the crankshaft via the<br>
connecting rods. The connecting rods and<br>
crankshaft convert the back-and-forth<br>
motion of the pistons into rotary motion.<br>
The camshaft is a smaller rotating shaft<br>
with small &quot;bumps&quot; on it called cams. As the<br>
cams rotate, they lift and lower the valves at<br>
just the right time to allow gasses to either<br>
flow into the cylinder or escape from it.<br>
The oil pump moves oil through the engine to keep the internal parts well lubricated.<br>
The function of the carburetor and fuel injector were covered in requirement 3.<br>
The ignition distributor has several jobs to do in the ignition system. First, it must close<br>
and open the primary circuit to produce the magnetic buildup and collapse in the<br>
ignition coil. Second, it times these actions so the resultant high-voltage surges from<br>
the secondary will be produced at the right time. Third, it must establish a timing<br>
sequence to direct the high-voltage surges to the proper spark plugs.<br>
The distributor injection system used in automotive diesel engines is classed as a lowpressure system in that pumping, metering, and distribution operations take place at<br>
low pressure. The high pressure required for injection is built up by the injector at each<br>
cylinder. A suction pump lifts fuel from the tank and delivers it to the float chamber.<br>
From here a second low-pressure pump delivers the fuel to the fuel distributor. Fuel<br>
passes through the distributor to the metering pump, where it is divided into measured<br>
charges. The fuel charges then are delivered back to the distributor, where they are sent<br>
to the injectors in the proper sequence.<br>
Electrical system<br>
The alternator is an electrical generator. As the engine turns a shaft in the alternator, it<br>
generates electricity to run everything in the car's electrical system, including the<br>
headlights, on-board computers, radio, and more. It also recharges the battery.<br>
The battery is used primarily for starting the vehicle. When the car is not running, the<br>
alternator cannot generate any electricity, so the battery must do this. It will also power<br>
the headlights, radio, and a few other things. The most common way a battery &quot;dies&quot; is<br>
when someone leaves the headlights on for too long with the engine off.<br>
The regulator evens out the voltage coming out of the alternator before it is fed to the<br>
rest of the electrical system. The voltage from the alternator can vary depending on a<br>
lot of different factors, and it is the regulator's job to make sure that none of the other<br>
components have to deal with varying amounts of power. Without the regulator, the<br>
headlights would brighten and dim as the alternator's voltage varied.<br>

how the engine torque is transmitted to both kinds of transmissions; the<br>
purpose of overdrive<br>
The transmission couples the engine to the drive shaft and has two main functions:<br>
1. Control direction of travel (forward or revers)<br>
2. Provide the operator with a selection of gear ratios between engine and wheels so<br>
that the vehicle can operate at best efficiency under a variety of driving conditions<br>
and loads.<br>
In a vehicle with a standard transmission the driver selects the desired gear manually.<br>
In a vehicle with an automatic transmission the transmission makes the gear selection<br>
itself depending on throttle position, vehicle speed, and the position of the shift control<br>
lever.<br>
In both cases, engine torque is transmitted to the wheels via a clutch. Automotive<br>
clutches depend on friction for their operation, whether it be solid friction as in the<br>
conventional clutch (found on a standard transmission), or fluid friction and inertia as<br>
utilized in the fluid coupling and torque converter (found on an automatic<br>
transmission).<br>
Overdrive can refer to two different things. An overdrive is a device which was<br>
commonly used on rear-wheel drive automobiles to allow the choice of an extra-high<br>
overall gear ratio for high speed cruising, thus saving fuel, at the cost of less torque.<br>
It also refers to a combination of gearing inside a transmission or transaxle which<br>
results in the output speed being greater than the input speed. In the latter case,<br>
&quot;overdrive&quot; does not refer to a physically separate identifiable part/assembly.<br>

Drum Brakes<br>
Disc Brakes<br>
If you put a car on a hydraulic lift, raised all four wheels off the ground, turned on the<br>
engine, and put it in gear, the rear wheels of rear-wheel drive vehicle would turn, while<br>
the front wheels of a front-wheel drive vehicle would turn. In a four-wheel drive vehicle,<br>
all four wheels would spin. The terms simply indicate which wheels are connected to<br>
the engine via the transmission.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Difference between drum brakes and disk brakes, standard brakes and<br>
power brakes, and the parking brake<br>
The diagram on the right<br>
shows the parts of a drum<br>
brake system. The brake is<br>
taken apart in this photo<br>
showing the brake drum on<br>
the left, and the brake shoes<br>
on the right. In operation, the<br>
shoes fit inside the drum. The<br>
drum rotates with the wheel,<br>
and the shoes are held<br>
stationary. When the brakes<br>
are applied, the shoes press<br>
against the inside surface of<br>
the drum, and the friction<br>
produced slows the wheels, stopping them ultimately.<br>
The diagram on the right<br>
shows the parts of a disk<br>
brake system. Here, the disk<br>
(gold) rotates with the wheel,<br>
and a stationary pair of<br>
                                                      <em>calipers </em>(red) squeeze both<br>
sides of the disc.<br>
In standard brakes the energy supplied by the operator’s foot in pushing down on the<br>
brake pedal is transferred to the brake mechanism on the wheels by various means. A<br>
mechanical hookup has been used since the earliest motor vehicles, but hydraulic<br>
pressure is used most extensively at the present time. Mechanically operated braking<br>
systems are obsolete on today’s automobiles, but these systems may be used for a<br>
portion of the braking systems in many vehicles.<br>
Power braking systems are designed to reduce the effort required to depress the brake<br>
pedal when stopping or holding a vehicle stationary. Most power brake systems use<br>
the difference in pressure between intake manifold vacuum and atmospheric pressure<br>
to develop the additional force required to decrease brake pedal pressure. When a<br>
vehicle is powered by a diesel engine, the absence of intake manifold vacuum requires<br>
the use of an auxiliary vacuum pump. This type of pump usually is driven by the engine<br>
or by an electric motor.<br>
The parking brake usually is operated by an auxiliary foot pedal or hand lever located in<br>
the driver compartment. This brake mechanism is designed to keep the vehicle<br>
stationary when the operator is not present. It is usually integrated into the disk or<br>
drum brake system (which ever is used) and locks in place until released by the<br>
operator. Use the parking brake every time you park, and at least every time you park on<br>
a hill or on a ferry to prevent the car from rolling. It is important to release the parking<br>
brake before driving.<br>

There are usually two dipsticks in the engine compartment for checking the engine oil<br>
and transmission oil levels. Once the dipstick is located, simply pull it out, wipe it clean<br>
on a rag or paper towel, reinsert it, pull it out again and check the level. The dipstick will<br>
be wet with oil up to the level of the fluid, and fluid levels are marked on the stick itself.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Check water/anti-freeze level. Change and flush the cooling system.<br>
The coolant level (also known as antifreeze) can be checked by looking in a plastic<br>
reservoir off the dise of the engine. This reservoir is usually mounted on the fender or<br>
on the front grill. It has markings on the side and an overflow area. It is also semitransparent so that you can see the level of the coolant inside.<br>
Flushing the cooling system<br>
1. The first thing you will need to do is make sure the engine is cool. It is very<br>
dangerous to open the cooling system on a hot engine, as serious burns can result.<br>
While you're waiting for the engine to cool, get a container that will hold at least<br>
two gallons. You will drain the coolant into this. Apply the parking brake.<br>
2. Set the vehicles temperature control to <em>Hot</em>. This opens a valve in some vehicles,<br>
connecting (or isolating) the car's heater and the cooling system.<br>
3. Open the radiator cap and locate the valve at the bottom of the radiator. If there is<br>
no valve, you may have to disconnect the hose at the bottom of the radiator. Get<br>
the catch container ready, open the valve, and maneuver the catch container into<br>
position to catch the coolant which should begin flowing as soon as you open the<br>
valve.<br>
4. Allow the radiator to drain. This may take a while. When coolant stops coming out,<br>
close the valve again.<br>
5. Fill the radiator with water - not with coolant. Turn on the engine, let it run until the<br>
engine's cooling fan turns on. This means the thermostat has opened and has<br>
allowed the coolant to flow into the engine. Turn off the engine. Drain the water out<br>
using the same steps as outlined above.<br>
6. Add a 50-50 mixture of water and antifreeze to the radiator until it is about an inch<br>
from the fill neck. Add more coolant to the reservoir, filling it to the &quot;full&quot; line. Then -<br>
with the radiator cap off - turn the engine on again while monitoring the coolant<br>
level. Add more coolant as the level drops, until it quits dropping. Replace the<br>
radiator cap.<br>
7. Take the waste coolant to a service station for recycling.<br>
8. After driving the vehicle for the first time after flushing the cooling system, let it<br>
cool and check the coolant level - both in the reservoir and by removing the radiator<br>
cap. Add coolant if it is necessary.<br>

When an engine is not running, the oil collects in an oil pan or sump at the bottom of<br>
the crankcase. There is an oil drain plug normally screwed into a drain hole at the<br>
bottom of the oil pan which is accessible from underneath the vehicle. To change the<br>
oil in a vehicle's engine, the drain plug is unscrewed to let the oil drain out of the oil pan<br>
and into a container. After the used oil drains out, the plug is screwed back into the<br>
drain hole. Some drain plugs have a replaceable washer to prevent leakage due to<br>
corrosion, rust or worn threads in the drain hole. The removable oil filter can be<br>
unscrewed at this time, often with the help of an oil filter removal tool, or in some<br>
cases, by hand. Then a new oil filter screwed back in after applying fresh oil to the<br>
sealing surface of the new filter. Then new oil is poured in through an otherwise capped<br>
opening at the top of the engine. For many cars, 4 to 5 quarts or liters of oil are needed<br>
to fill the engine. Take the old motor oil to a service station for recycling. It is illegal to<br>
dispose of used motor oil in the trash or dump it into the environment!<br>

1. Locate the point on the car designed to take the jack. This is usually illustrated in<br>
the owner's manual, and is often a point on the chassis a few inches behind the<br>
front tire, or a few inches in front of the rear tire.<br>
2. Place <em>chocks </em>around two of the car's tires. If changing a front tire, place the chocks<br>
on the two rear tires. If changing a rear tire, place them on the front tires. Chocks<br>
are brick-sized blocks that prevent the car from rolling. Indeed, you can use about<br>
anything for a chock, so long as it will stand up to the pressure of a car being<br>
parked on it, and if it is tall enough to prevent the car from rolling over it. Bricks,<br>
blocks, blocks of wood, or even large rocks can be used as chocks, or you can use<br>
store-bought ones.<br>
3. Set the parking brake.<br>
4. Loosen the lug nuts, but do not remove them yet. It is easier to loosen them before<br>
jacking up the vehicle because the tires will remain stationary. Once the vehicle is<br>
jacked up, the wheels will easily rotate, making it more difficult to loosen the lug<br>
nuts. It may be necessary to remove the hubcap to get at the lug nuts. The hubcap<br>
usually prys off with a screw driver or with the end of the jack handle. Be careful<br>
not to damage the hubcap.<br>
5. Place the jack beneath the jack point and use it to lift the vehicle. Do not ever lift<br>
more than one tire from the ground at a time! This is a very dangerous thing to do,<br>
because it makes it <em>very </em>easy to knock a car off the jacks.<br>
6. Stop lifting the vehicle as soon as the tire is lifted from the ground.<br>
7. Finish removing the lug nuts.<br>
8. Once all the lug nuts have been removed, you may pull the tire/wheel assembly<br>
towards yourself and off the wheel mount. Once it's off, you can carefully roll it out<br>
of the way and get the new tire (or the same tire since this is likely an exercise, and<br>
there is likely nothing wrong with the tire in the first place).<br>
9. Lift the new tire onto the wheelmount, aligning the holes in the wheel with the bolts<br>
on the wheel mount. Push the tire into position and quickly put a lug nut or two in<br>
place. Get them all on, and finger-tight first, and then get the lug wrench out and<br>
begin tightening the first lugnut.<br>
10. After the first lug nut is tightened, move to the one on the opposite side of the<br>
wheel (or as near to opposite as you can get) and tighten it. Continue tightening<br>
the other nuts, going to opposite sides of the wheel each time so that they are<br>
tightened evenly. When they are all right, lower the jack.<br>
11. Remove the jack.<br>
12. Go around the lug nuts again, tightening them further. With the car's weight<br>
preventing the tires from rotating, you should be able to tighten them a little more<br>
(but don't overdo it).<br>
13. Congratulate yourself on a job well done.<br>

Lubrication of the chassis is accomplished by using a grease gun. Grease guns have a<br>
tube on them through which the grease is forced. At the end of this tube is a fitting that<br>
attaches to a grease nipple. The vehicle service manual will show you where to find the<br>
grease nipples. First wipe any dirt or foreign material from the grease nipple. Then<br>
place the grease gun on the grease nipple and force grease into it. Remove the grease<br>

The manufacturer specifies how often the oil changes should be made. For example, most<br>
people believe that the oil change frequency should be every 3000 miles or every 3 months,<br>
whichever comes sooner. This 3000 mile oil change interval has been relentlessly promoted<br>
by oil changing companies for decades. It had a scientific basis when engines used non-multiweight, non-detergent oil. It no longer has any scientific basis, but it is still being promoted by<br>
certain entities, most notably the oil change industry in the United States (including car<br>
dealerships). Most manufacturers recommend oil change intervals of 6,000 miles or more for<br>
modern cars. For convenience, the oil filter is usually also replaced at the time the oil is<br>
changed.<br>
Transmission fluid change frequency is specified in the owner's manual, but is most often<br>
every 15,000 miles.<br>
How often the coolant should be flushed and changed is also spelled out in the owner's<br>
manual. 30,000 miles or three years is typical.<br>

exterior.<br>
The owner's manual has a service schedule in it, telling you how often to change the oil,<br>
various filters, and other maintenance items. You also need to check tire inflation and tread<br>
wear on a regular basis. If you have ever pedaled a bicycle with low tires, you know that it<br>
requires <em>much </em>more effort to propel a vehicle with improperly inflated tires.<br>
Keep your vehicle clean, and wax it at least once per year (in the autumn is best so the car's<br>
finish is protected from any road salt). Vacuum the interior as often as you change the oil, as<br>
any dirt that stays in the carpet will accelerate carpet wear. Wipe vinyl and leather seats down<br>
with an appropriate cleaner and vacuum cloth seats. You should also clean the dashboard<br>
and interior door panels regularly.<br>

Whole wheat retains the bran and germ as well as the endosperm, in contrast to white flour<br>
which retains only the endosperm.<br>
Whole wheat foods are nutritionally superior to refined grains, richer in dietary fiber,<br>
antioxidants, protein (and in particular the amino acid lysine), dietary minerals (including<br>
magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and selenium), and vitamins (including niacin, vitamin<br>
B6, and vitamin E).<br>
The greater amount of dietary fiber, as much as four times than found in refined grains, is<br>
likely the most important benefit, as it has been shown to reduce the incidence of some forms<br>
of cancer, digestive system diseases, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Some of<br>
these protective effects occur because carbohydrates from whole grains are digested and<br>
enter the bloodstream more slowly, avoiding the &quot;sugar rush.&quot;<br>

Yeast interacts chemically with sugar in warm water to provide leavening. This allows the<br>

In more detail, yeasts make up a group of single-celled fungi, a few species of which are<br>
commonly used to leaven bread. In the absence of oxygen, yeasts produce their energy by<br>
converting sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol. In baking, the carbon dioxide raises the<br>
bread and the ethanol evaporates.<br>

mentioned.<br>
Old Testament: </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Exodus 12:34 &amp; 39 </span><span style="color:#212529;">-- The Israelites prepared unleavened bread for the first<br>
Passover<br>
New Testament: Jesus mentioned leavening several times including: </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Matthew 13:33</span><span style="color:#212529;">; </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Luke<br>
13:20, 21<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">Jesus compares the Pharisees to leaven in </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Matthew 16:6-12</span><span style="color:#212529;">; </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Mark 8:15</span><span style="color:#212529;">; </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Luke 12:1<br>

corruption effects the whole church. See </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Gal 5:9 </span><span style="color:#212529;">and </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">1 Corinthians 5:1-8</span><span style="color:#212529;">. Throughout the Old<br>
Testament, and into Paul's writings, leaven symbolized corruption, defilement, and sin. Of<br>
course there is nothing inheriently bad about yeast, it is only used as an analogy.<br>

Whole Wheat Bread (Vegan)<br>
Ingredients Procedure<br>
1 C warm<br>
water (105-<br>
115 degrees<br>
F)<br>
2 T (or 2<br>
packages) of<br>
active dry<br>
yeast<br>
1 pinch<br>
unrefined<br>
sugar<br>
1 C soy milk<br>
1/3 C<br>
(packed)<br>
unrefined<br>
sugar<br>
3 T vegan<br>
butter or<br>
margarine<br>
1 T salt<br>
1 1/2 C<br>
walnuts<br>
(optional)<br>
1/4 C soft<br>
tofu<br>
(mashed), stir<br>
until chunks<br>
are minimal<br>
(egg replacer<br>
or 1 T ground<br>
flax seed also<br>
works)<br>
2 1/2 C cups<br>
fine-milled or<br>
mediummilled whole<br>
wheat flour<br>
3 7/8 C<br>
unbleached<br>
all-purpose<br>
white flour<br>
1. In a small bowl stir up the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water, add a pinch<br>
of unrefined sugar. Let the yeast activate for 10 minutes.<br>
2. To a large mixing bowl add the other 1/2 cup water, milk, unrefined<br>
sugar, melted vegan margarine, salt, tofu, and whole wheat flour. Stir<br>
with wooden spoon until creamy.<br>
3. Add the yeast mixture which should be foamy by now. Add walnuts.<br>
Add in the unbleached wheat flour a little at a time. Stir until the<br>
dough is too thick for the spoon then put the dough on a lightly<br>
floured cutting board or counter top and mix by hand. When all the<br>
flour is added, knead dough for around 5-7 minutes. Cover dough<br>
with a towel and let rise for around 1 to 1.5 hours. Dough should<br>
double in size.<br>
4. Knock the dough down once then place 2 equal portions of the<br>
dough into 2 greased pans. If you want the loaves to look fancy do<br>
this: roll dough into 4 separate dough &quot;snakes&quot;. Twist 2 of these<br>
together to make a nice looking intertwined loaf. Let rise about 45<br>
minutes.<br>
5. Brush tops of loaves with melted margarine (keeps them from<br>
drying out) and dust with cinnamon, uncooked oatmeal or white<br>
flour (aesthetics). Bake in oven preheated to 375F for around 35<br>
minutes. When done, loaves will sound hollow when tapped.<br>

3. Combine flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda<br>
into a mixing bowl. Mix well.<br>
4. Cut the margarine into the dry mixture until it forms pea-sized<br>
clumps<br>
5. Add the vinegar to the soymilk and stir well (this is a<br>
buttermilk substitute)<br>
6. Add the soymilk and yeast mixture to the dough. Combine<br>
until it has an even consistency. It will be sticky.<br>
7. Roll the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Fold it over and<br>
roll it out again. Repeat for one minute.<br>
8. Roll the dough out to a thickness of a half inch.<br>
9. Using a biscuit cutter (or a juice glass), cut circles out of the<br>
dough and place on a shallow, greased pan.<br>
10. Bake for 10-12 minutes.<br>

mixture of milk, sugar, and eggs is harmful to health.<br>
Baking soda and baking powder<br>
In <em>The Ministry of Healing</em>, Ellen White wrote that baking soda and baking powder should<br>
not be used for making bread. She wrote, &quot;Soda causes inflammation of the stomach and<br>
often poisons the entire system.&quot;<br>
Milk, sugar, and eggs<br>
When these ingredients are mixed and eaten, they ferment in the abdomen, giving the<br>
same effect as alcohol products. In Ministry of Healing page 301-302 we can read &quot;Far<br>
too much sugar is ordinarily used in food. Cakes, sweet puddings, pastries, jellies, jams,<br>
are active causes of indigestion. Especially harmful are the custards and puddings in<br>
which milk, eggs, and sugar are the chief ingredients. The free use of milk and sugar taken<br>
together should be avoided.&quot;<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">7 </span><span style="color:#212529;">How do you test a cake for being done? How do you keep a cake from &quot;falling&quot;?<br>
You can test to see if a cake is done by inserting a toothpick or butter knife carefully into the<br>
                                                      <em>center </em>of the cake. If it comes out clean without any &quot;cake goo&quot; attached, then the cake is<br>
done.<br>
You can keep a cake from falling by not introducing a cake to temperatures drastically<br>
different from the oven too quickly and by not slamming the door on the oven before the cake<br>
is done.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Prepare two of the following:<br>

See the Wikibook </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Cookbook </span><span style="color:#212529;">recipes for </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Cakes and Cupcakes</span><span style="color:#212529;">. Remember that you can<br>
use soy milk instead of cow's milk. In cake recipes calling for eggs, you can substitute<br>
a half banana and a quarter cup of apple sauce.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Cake from a mix (any flavor)<br>
The best advice we can give here is to buy a mix and follow the directions on the<br>
package. Cake mixes were introduced to the market in the 1950's, though they were not<br>
initially well-received. At that time, the only thing the homemaker needed to do was add<br>
water, blend, pour it in a pan, and bake. Marketeers determined that homemakers did<br>
not like this because it did not feel enough like &quot;homemade&quot; so they omitted powdered<br>
eggs from the mix and had the homemaker add fresh eggs along with the water. As<br>
soon as this change was made to the formulation, sales skyrocketed.<br>
It should be noted however, that it is perhaps impossible to find a cake mix that does<br>
not use either baking powder or baking soda, or the combination of eggs, milk, and<br>
sugar (see requirement 6). However, 3 tablespoons of water plus 1 tablespoon of either<br>
cornstarch or ground flax seed makes a good egg-substitute.<br>

Berry Pie<br>
Ingredients Procedure<br>
Double crust<br>
2 cups allpurpose flour<br>
1/3 cup<br>
shortening<br>
5-6 Tablespoons<br>
water<br>
Pie filling<br>
5 cups<br>
blueberries,<br>
blackberries,<br>
raspberries, or a<br>
mix of them<br>
(fresh or frozen)<br>
3/4 cup sugar<br>
1/3 cup flour<br>
1.5 Tablespoons<br>
lemon juice<br>
Double Crust<br>
1. Cut the shortening into the flour until it is reduced to<br>
pea-sized chunks<br>
2. Add a tablespoon of water to the center, and mix it in<br>
with a fork. Move the dampened mix to the side and<br>
add another tablespoon of water. Repeat until you<br>
have used 5-6 tablespoons of water.<br>
3. Divide the dough in half, and form into two equal-size<br>
balls.<br>
4. Lightly flour your work surface and roll one dough ball<br>
out into a 12&quot; circle.<br>
5. Pick up the dough by wrapping it around the rolling<br>
pin. Transport it to a 9&quot; pie pan and lay it in, being<br>
careful to not stretch the dough.<br>
Pie filling<br>
1. Mix the sugar, flour, and lemon juice in a large mixing<br>
bowl.<br>
2. Add the berries, and toss until they are coated.<br>
3. If the berries were frozen, allow them to sit for 15-30<br>
minutes (but don't let them completely thaw).<br>
4. Pour the filling into the pie pan (previously lined with<br>
the bottom crust). The filling will mound to an<br>
alarming height, but do not worry - it will compact as it<br>
bakes.<br>
5. Roll out the top crust until you have another 12&quot; circle.<br>
6. Pick up the top crust with the rolling pin and carefully<br>
lay it over the berry mound.<br>
7. Pinch the edges to seal the top and bottom crusts<br>
together.<br>
8. Cut off any crust that extends over the edge of the pie<br>
pan.<br>
9. Make several slits in the top crust to allow steam to<br>
escape. Be creative here.<br>
10. Cover the pie with a sheet of aluminum foil that has<br>
had a 6&quot; circle cut from the center. This will protect the<br>
edges of the crust and keep them from becoming<br>
overdone.<br>
11. Bake at 375°F for 30 minutes (fresh berries) or 50<br>
minutes (frozen berries)<br>
12. Remove the aluminum foil and bake an additional 20<br>
minutes.<br>
13. Place on a wire rack to cool.<br>
14. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.<br>

More Information<br>
By definition, refrigerator cookies are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to become<br>
even stiffer. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies<br>
before baking. Refrigerator cookies are any type of cookie where the dough needs to be<br>
chilled before baking the cookies.<br>
Examples of refrigerator cookies include:<br>
Gingerbread cookies<br>
Most &quot;cookie cutter&quot; cookies<br>
Some types of chocolate chip cookies.<br>

while at work.<br>
Start by asking permission to job shadow a barber or hairstylist for the day or a couple hours<br>
over several days.<br>
During this exercise you should be able to learn the answers to the other requirements and<br>
demonstrate the required skills. Most barbers and hairstylists like to talk and will be happy to<br>
explain what they do and how they do it.<br>
This honor will not make you into a barber or hairstylist (that takes weeks or months of<br>
school) but you should learn about the tools of the trade and gain an appreciation for this<br>
technical occupation that helps us all stay looking well groomed.<br>

You will probably want to bring a friend/victim for this exercise. Perhaps another Pathfinder<br>
working on the honor so you can shampoo each other. The barber can judge the correctness<br>
of the shampoo job.<br>
1. Soak the hair, first. It's important that the hair is wet to make shampooing easy otherwise<br>
it won't work. Use warm or cold water.<br>
2. Massage the scalp. Petrissage is a scalp massaging technique to stimulate blood-flow to<br>
the scalp encouraging healthy hair and scalp, it also removes dirt.<br>
3. Shampoo your hair. Hair usually only needs one or two applications of shampoo. More<br>
than this can lead to static or fly-away results and leave the hair unprotected. If the first<br>
shampoo application doesn't lather, rinse, then shampoo a second time.<br>
4. Rinse your hair. It's important to ensure that no shampoo residue remains as this can dry<br>
the scalp out and create a flaky itchy scalp, it also leaves a greasy film<br>
5. Add conditioner. Gently squeeze the water out of your hair. Distribute the conditioner<br>
evenly through the hair using only your fingers. Never use a comb in the shower. It will pull<br>
on your hair and create more breakages in the long run.<br>
6. Rinse, Again. Rinse the hair thoroughly ensuring no residue is left behind. To finish use<br>
cold water which will close the cuticles, resulting in shine and give your hair bounce.<br>
7. Thoroughly dry your hair. When towel-drying never rub the hair as this will cause tangling<br>
and damage the cuticle of the hair. Air drying is better because blow dryers dry out your<br>
hair.<br>
8. Style the hair with gel or proceed to cutting.<br>

You should not need to actually give a full haircut, although you may feel confident to give a<br>
simple cut as a beginner. Bring your own volunteers or use practice heads from a hairstyling<br>
school.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Explain and demonstrate the purpose of at least two different kinds of combs<br>
used in cutting hair.<br>
A comb is a toothed device used for styling, cleaning and managing hair and scalp. Combs<br>
are among the oldest tools found by archaeologists, having been discovered in very refined<br>
forms from settlements dating back to 5,000 years ago in Persia.<br>
There are many types of hair combs on the market today.<br>
Wide tooth combs are best for getting out tangles.<br>
Fine tooth combs help get the hairs all in place. You may wish to begin with a wide tooth<br>
and then finish up with the fine tooth model.<br>
Rat Tail Comb - You might think that the rat tail is simply a comb with a handle, but the tail<br>
is actually designed to help get parts straight. Use the handle portion of the “rat tail” to<br>
run across the area you wish to part.<br>
A Pin Tail comb allows for precise parting. It is also a good tool for men straightening<br>
their hair with a flat iron because it can work with one particular section without leaving<br>
stray hairs. It also keeps you from accidentally poking your scalp. The pin tail comb<br>
allows for precision work, such as adding a streak of color.<br>
Barber Combs allow the barber to cut and trim without getting too close to the head, kind<br>
of like the guards on an electric clipper. Barber combs are tapered to provide a lot of<br>
different options.<br>
The Rake comb resembles a garden rake. It is very good for untangling long hair.<br>
Teasing Comb are used to add some texture and body. The teasing comb is used by<br>
taking a strand of hairs and holding them straight up. Run the teasing tool from six to ten<br>
times through the hairs. Do this with as many strands as you like. You should have a fairly<br>
long hairstyle for this to be most effective.<br>

Thinning Shear, also know as Texturizing Shears or Chunking Shears, are used to remove<br>
“bulk” from the hair without altering the hairstyle. Thinning Shears have “teeth” as opposed to<br>
“blades” and remove less hair with a single snip.<br>
Yoko Scissors come in a variety of forms but they generally are manufactured from premium<br>
Japanese Hitachi steel. Yoko scissors allow smooth cutting with a very slim blade and<br>
specially designed thumb rings. They are well balanced. Some examples </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">[1]<br>

scissors have a bent thumb ring to make them more ergonomic, so that your thumb sits at a<br>
more natural angle.<br>
Explain and demonstrate at least two purposes for the use of a clipper.<br>

A thimble is a protective shield worn on the finger or<br>
thumb. It is used for pushing a needle through a piece of<br>
fabric in situations where the pressure applied to the<br>
needle would otherwise cause the needle to pierce the<br>
skin. A thimble is most usually made from metal, but can<br>
also be found made from leather, rubber, wood, glass or<br>
china.<br>

A cloth tape measure is used for measuring a person for<br>
the purpose of sizing a garment. It is also used to measure<br>
cloth.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Scissors and shears<br>
Scissors are generally multi-purpose and have similar small 'handles'<br>
with sharp blades that are riveted together. Scissors come in various<br>
sizes, quality and price ranges as well as with some design<br>
enhancements for specific tasks, such as for cutting hair, embroidery<br>
threads or crafts. You would use a pair of household scissors to cut parcel twine, paper,<br>
light card stock or food packages. Scissors are essential cutting tools and considered<br>
basic housewares.<br>
Shears on the other hand have a noticeable design difference - one side (or both) has a<br>
larger handle to accommodate a couple of fingers (thumb in the top and fingers in the<br>
bottom). The handles are often attached with an adjustable screw for precision cutting<br>
(especially dressmaker's shears).<br>

Pinking Shears<br>
Needles<br>
1: Balance Wheel; 2: Backspace lever<br>
Pinking shears are scissors whose blades are sawtooth<br>
instead of straight. Pinking shears will leave a zigzag<br>
pattern instead of a straight edge.<br>
Pinking shears are useful for cutting woven cloth. Cloth<br>
edges that are unfinished will easily fray, the weave<br>
becoming undone and threads pull out easily. The<br>
sawtooth pattern does not prevent the fraying but limits<br>
the length of the frayed thread and thus limits damage.<br>

Needles are used for piercing a fabric and passing a<br>
thread through it for the purpose of making a stitch. This<br>
can be done by hand or by machine. A hand needle has a<br>
hole in it (called the <em>eye</em>) near its back. A machine needle<br>
has its eye near the point.<br>

The balance wheel provides a method of<br>
manually moving the needle up or down. It is<br>
used to raise the needle out of the cloth<br>
when the stitch is finished, or to raise the<br>
thread take-up to make it accessible when<br>
threading the machine.<br>

The thread take-up moves up and down with the needle, keeping the thread tight and<br>
drawing it from the spool as needed.<br>

The feed dogs are little tread-like pieces beneath the presser foot. As the sewing<br>
machine is operated, the feed dogs advance the cloth forward (or backwards if the<br>
backspace lever is activated). The presser foot holds the cloth against the feed dogs<br>
so that they can move the cloth along.<br>

The bobbin supplies a second spool of thread. Between the bobbin and the needle, two<br>
pieces of thread are tied into a knot forming the stitch. The bobbin can be filled with<br>
thread by removing it from the position shown and placing it in a mechanism on the top<br>
Bobbin<br>
Control<br>
of the sewing machine. It is usually filled<br>
with the same color thread as is thread<br>
through the needle. The bobbin's thread<br>
comes up from the bottom of the machine<br>
through a plate between the feed dogs.<br>

The control is a foot pedal that is similar to<br>
the gas pedal in a car. When it is fully<br>
depressed, the sewing machine operates at its maximum speed. When lightly<br>
depressed, the machine operates more slowly. When released, the sewing machine<br>
stops. Having a foot-operated control frees both hands for guiding the cloth through<br>
the machine.<br>

The backspace lever (shown in the photo with the balance wheel) reverses the<br>
direction that the feed dogs move the cloth. A stitch is often started an inch or so away<br>
from the back edge of the cloth with the backspace lever activated. When the stitch<br>
gets close to the back edge of the cloth, the lever is released and the cloth moves<br>
forward through the machine. Stitches are also ended this way. Doing this provides a<br>
stronger seam and locks the stitch in place.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">Winding the Bobbin<br>
First, check that the bobbin has enough thread of the right color for the work you wish to do. If<br>
it does not, you will need to wind a bobbin. First, pass a few inches of thread through a hole in<br>
the bobbin. Then place the bobbin on a spindle located on the top right of the sewing<br>
machine. You may need to move a lever into position. Loop the thread from the spool going to<br>
the left around a hook on the left of the machine, and then to the bobbin. Wind the thread back<br>
onto the spool until it is tight, but be careful not to pull it out of the hole in the bobbin! Then<br>
gently press the foot lever. The machine should wind thread onto the bobbin. When the bobbin<br>
is full (or when it has as much thread on it as you think you'll need), release the foot pedal, cut<br>
the thread, and place the bobbin back into its compartment.<br>
Threading the machine<br>
The spool mounts to a large spindle at the top center-right of the sewing machine. From there,<br>
the thread travels to the left to a button-like pulley and turns towards the operator. It travels<br>
across the top of the machine into a slot, and then turns downwards. Near the front, it should<br>
wrap around another &quot;hitch&quot; and go back up to the top of the machine, where it loops into a<br>
slot on the thread take-up. Again, the thread turns down until it gets to the needle, passing<br>
through the eye. (It helps if you trim the thread with sharp scissors before trying to thread a<br>
needle).<br>
Run the machine<br>
To run the machine, lift the presser foot and slide a piece of practice cloth beneath it. Then<br>
lower the presser foot. Gently press down on the foot pedal as you guide the cloth into the<br>
machine. Practice using the backspace lever and the foot pedal as you try to make a straight<br>
stitch. Once you get the hang of it, you'll find it's a lot of fun!<br>

To make a hem, it is best to visit the ironing board before doing any stitching. Fold the<br>
cloth over and press a crease where the seam will be. Then fold it over again and press<br>
another crease. This will tuck the loose edge of the fabric into the seam so that it will<br>
not be exposed, and that will prevent it from unraveling.<br>
Pressing the seam first helps tremendously when stitching the hem, because it<br>
prevents the hem from creeping. Once the hem is creased, place the item on the<br>
sewing machine with the crease to the right. Lift the presser foot and slip the item<br>
beneath it. Line up the needle left-to-right so that it will place the stitch the desired<br>
distance from the edge of the hem. Line it up front-to-back so that the needle will<br>
pierce the cloth a half inch or so from the back edge of the hem. Then lower the<br>
presser foot. Hold down the backspace lever and gently press the foot pedal. As soon<br>
as the stitch reaches the back edge of the cloth, release the backspace lever, and the<br>
sewing machine will begin stitching in the forward direction. Going backwards first<br>
locks the stitch in place.<br>
Gently guide the fabric into the sewing machine, paying careful attention to the edge.<br>
Sewing machines have lines etched into the surface beneath the needle for use as a<br>
guide. Try to guide the cloth using one of these guide lines to keep the stitch a constant<br>
distance from the edge of the hem. Don't try to go too fast. If you make a mistake, stop<br>
- you may need to remove the stitches and start over. It is far better to start over than to<br>
just keep sewing!<br>
As the stitch nears the other end of the hem, slow down. Stitch all the way to the edge<br>
of the hem, and press the backspace lever just as you reach it. Stitch backwards for<br>
about a half inch, again to lock down the stitch. Then stop. Use the balance wheel to<br>
raise the needle out of the cloth. You may need to raise the needle to its highest point<br>
so that the thread on the underside is released. After the needle has been raised, lift the<br>
presser foot and slide the fabric out from under the needle. Cut the thread (there will be<br>
two - a top thread and a bottom thread), but leave at least three inches of thread<br>
coming out of the eye of the needle. Otherwise, the next attempt at making a stitch<br>
could easily unthread the needle.<br>
Remove the cloth from the machine and cut the loose threads from the hem. Ta da!<br>
You should now have a nice hem, and the machine should be ready to stitch another!<br>

The first step in sewing on a button or a snap is to properly locate it. If you are replacing a<br>
button, fasten the remaining buttons first - then see where the button hole for the missing<br>
button lines up. Thread a needle and tie it off, then mark the location of the button by passing<br>
the needle through the cloth from the underside. If desired, you can then unbutton the other<br>
buttons.<br>
Pass the needle through one of the holes in the button from the back. Then pass it through an<br>
adjacent hold from the front. Then insert the needle into the cloth near the point where the<br>
stitch was begun. Pull the thread tight, but not <em>too </em>tight. A little slack is desirable so that the<br>
button is not held too tightly to the cloth (that makes it hard to use the button). Ideally, the<br>
button should be able to pull away from the cloth by about an eighth of an inch. Loop through<br>
the cloth and the same two holes in the button half a dozen times or more. Then cross over<br>
and stitch through the other two holes (assuming a four-hole button), again making half a<br>
dozen or more loops. Finally, pass the needle through the cloth near the button, but do not go<br>
through the button hole. Snake the thread out from under the button, and wrap it around the<br>
thread several times. Then pass the needle back through the cloth, beneath the button and tie<br>
it off.<br>
Be sure to use sturdy thread when attaching a button. They take a lot of abuse. If attached<br>
well with strong thread though, the button should remain fastened for <em>years </em>of heavy use.<br>

Selvage<br>
the edge of a piece of fabric, specially woven to resist unraveling.<br>
Bias<br>
is a line that would go from corner to corner on a square piece of fabric. The bias of a<br>
fabric is very stretchy, crossing the fabric's threads at a 45° angle.<br>
Grain of Fabric<br>
is the internal lay of the fabric - that is how the threads from which the fabric is woven are<br>
arranged. The lengthwise grain is parallel to the selvage, and the crosswise grain is<br>
perpendicular to the selvage.<br>

Laundry Bag<br>
A laundry bag is not difficult to make. It is usually made from two pieces of cloth: a circle and<br>
a rectangle. The circle should be about 1.25 inches larger in diameter than the desired laundry<br>
bag. The width of the rectangle should be the same as the circumference of the circle<br>
(diameter times 3.14) plus another 1.5 inches. The length of the rectangle should be the<br>
desired length of the laundry bag plus two inches.<br>
Once the circle and rectangle have been cut out, sew a wide hem along the width of the<br>
rectangle. Then thread a length of rope through the hem, leaving about six inches of rope<br>
coming out from both ends.<br>
The next stitch will form a tube from the rectangle. This stitch should be made while the tube<br>
is inside out, so make sure the roped hem is positioned as you want it before starting. Pin the<br>
two edges of the rectangle together and make a stitch along the entire length of the edges<br>
about 5/8&quot; from the edge. This should complete the tube. Once the tube has been stitched, tie<br>
the two ends of the rope together (use a fisherman's knot as illustrated in the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Knot Tying<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">honor). You should be able to cinch up the rope and cloth the opening of the laundry bag. This<br>
bag will also be carried by the rope.<br>
Next, with the tube still inside-out, pin the circle to the end of the tube opposite the roped hem.<br>
Once the circle is pinned into place, carefully sew it to the tube. When this stitch is complete,<br>
turn the bag inside out and admire your work.<br>
Medical Mask<br>
With the rise of COVID-19, several websites have provided instructions for making DIY a<br>
medical mask. Wearing a mask will reduce the chances of the wearer becoming infected, but<br>
more importantly, it can reduce the odds of the wearer infecting others. This is especially<br>
important because a person can be infected with he corona virus without showing any<br>
symptoms, and may spread the virus before becoming aware that they are infected.<br>
By using a homemade mask, you can reduce the demand for N95 masks which makes them<br>
more available to medical professionals who need them most. Wearing a mask in public<br>
sends the message that you care about others.<br>
Make sure to launder the mask after each use. You might need several so that you can always<br>
use a fresh one when you must leave your home. Remember that wearing a mask should not<br>
be a substitute for social distancing or frequent and thorough hand washing. Every action you<br>
take to reduce the chances of spreading COVID-19 or becoming infected yourself works<br>
together to greatly reduce those odds.<br>

insists that you not make a mask from a solid color (especially not solid blue or solid white). If<br>
the only material you have on hand for making a mask is solid, consider </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">tie-dying </span><span style="color:#212529;">your<br>
material before using it to make a mask. Another alternative would be to label the mask as<br>
NOT MEDICAL GRADE with a Sharpie. You can do this on the inside if you like.<br>

To properly prepare reed for use in weaving, it must be allowed to dry completely for 3-7 days<br>
prior to use. This time might be shorter (or longer) depending on your local humidity. Store<br>
reeds out of direct sunlight to limit discoloration due to sun exposure. When you are ready to<br>
begin your project, first trim your reeds to the desired length. Then. soak one or two lengths of<br>
reed in warm (not hot) water for 5-10 minutes until the reeds bend easily. Make sure the reeds<br>
do not become waterlogged (soggy).<br>

Weaver singeing refers to removing the small hairs or splinters that form on the reds as<br>
you weave. The most common method is to burn them off using a blowtorch or lighter,<br>
thus the term <em>singeing. </em>This can be dangerous for several reasons; including the risk of<br>
burning yourself or your basket. IF this method is used, don't keep the flame in one<br>
place too long, or you will damage the basket reeds. This must be done while the<br>
basket is still damp.<br>
An alternative (and safer) method is to trim the hairs or splits off using some heavy<br>
duty shear. You may want to do a small bit of sanding afterwards to smooth the<br>
trimmed areas.<br>

the group of potential buyers the business is attempting to attract. A given target<br>
market is very product and business specific can be defined by some combination of<br>
geography, income level, and often other demographic characteristics like gender, age,<br>
marital status, faith, buying habits, interests, amd more. Most businesses will attract<br>
the occasional buyer from outside the target market as well, but if too many buyers are<br>
from outside the target market it is time to refine the target market.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Describe three ways in which a business may be conceived.<br>
The best business ideas are found at the intersection of 6 considerations, which we can<br>
remember as the 6 C's.<br>
1. Customers<br>
Your business will need customers and you must determine who the customers are and<br>
discover what the customers really want. The bankruptcy rolls are filled with former<br>
businesses which were based on what the business person THINKS the potential customers<br>
want. Do not assume that other people want what you want. You must do market research<br>
with real potential customers. Do not assume that your friends and family will tell you the<br>
truth about your idea because few people are willing to give honest negative feedback to<br>
someone close to them.<br>
Also, a business with only one customer is more like a subcontractor or type of employee. If<br>
you rely on only one customer that customer controls you and can easily put you out of<br>
business. Figure out how you will diversify your customer base.<br>
2. Compelling<br>
A great business idea has to be something you care about. You will be spending a lot of time<br>
on your business, selling others on your business and its products and investing your money<br>
in the business. If you don't have a passion for the business your chance of failure is very high,<br>
even if all the other C's are covered. Equally important, your product must be compelling to the<br>
potential customers. Unless you offer something they absolutely have to buy (basic utilities<br>
for example) customers who think the product is just interesting are useless - you need<br>
people who will make the purchase.<br>
3. Competency<br>
If the business does not fit your skills and abilities you should not do the business until you<br>
acquire the appropriate skills. There might be a great potential business for a dentist in your<br>
town but if you have not graduated dental school it is not the business for you. Other cases<br>
might not be so obvious. Think about the technical, legal, sales, and other aspects of the<br>
business. If you can't do everything, and most of us can't, you will need to hire other people.<br>
Can you afford and competently supervise these specialists?<br>
4. Capital<br>
The business must be financially feasible. Every business has setup costs, equipment costs,<br>
cost of space. You will need enough capital to get your business set up, and to expand it over<br>
time.<br>
5. Cashflow<br>
Beyond the required capital, most business lose money during start up. You will need working<br>
capital (money to cover short term differences between cash inflows and outflows). Many<br>
businesses fail by running out of money because the management misjudged the cashflow<br>
situation. This problem plagues businesses that grow slower than anticipated and those that<br>
grow faster than planned for. Fast growth requires investment in people, equipment,<br>
receivables, inventory etc and this can run even an otherwise highly successful business out<br>
of money.<br>
6. Competition<br>
Every business has direct and indirect competition. You must evaluate your competition<br>
carefully to understand if and how you can differentiate your business from the competition<br>
successfully.<br>
A Pathfinder Club as a Business Idea<br>
Discuss with your Pathfinders a business they are familiar with - which could be large or<br>
small, then consider stretching their minds by analysing their Pathfinder Club as a business.<br>
In many ways, your Pathfinder Club is a (non-profit) business. The club needs customers<br>
(children between the ages of 10-15). The most obvious potential customers are children and<br>
teens within your local church, but children in the wider community are also welcome to<br>
participate, as are children from nearby churches. If the Pathfinder Club is the business, the<br>
Pathfinders are the customers.<br>
We know that many kids like Pathfinders, but do they really want it? There would be no<br>
demand for Pathfinders at 9 AM Tuesday morning because the kids are in school. We also<br>
need to craft the Pathfinder program to be exciting and appealing to potential customers. Too<br>
much book work without enough hands on activities will not make happy customers.<br>
If you were thinking about leading a Pathfinder Club you'd better find it compelling because<br>
you are signing up for a big job. You also need to be able to make it compelling to your<br>
customers and their parents.<br>
Obviously a potential leader needs to have leadership skills, and be willing and able to acquire<br>
lots of skills, just like in a business.<br>
A new Pathfinder Club needs capital for uniforms, flags, tents, gear, and so on. It also needs<br>
cashflow from the sponsoring church, dues, fundraising etc. Without capital and cashflow<br>
your club will not have the things it needs to run, or deliver the product (club experience and<br>
fun) to the customers.<br>
Just like any business, a Pathfinder Club has direct and indirect competition. Nearby<br>
Pathfinder Clubs (within driving distance) are direct competition because a Pathfinder might<br>
move over to a bigger/most successful/better lead/more fun Pathfinder Club. Scouts/Girl<br>
Guides are also direct competitors offering similar (though not spiritual) programs. Indirect<br>
competitors include competitive sports teams, non-competitive recreational activities, or<br>
anything else that can use up a Pathfinder's free time, even video games.<br>
There are far more ways you should NOT come up with a business idea. Lots of businesses<br>
are started because the 'businessperson' if you can call them that, wants to do something<br>
interesting but refuses to figure out a good plan or do the market research.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Explain the benefits of having a management team in a business (note that one<br>
person might adopt all these roles in a small/micro business).<br>
Each business, no matter how small needs people to perform the important functions.<br>
Someone needs to take care of the finances, production, sales, purchasing, personal<br>
management, and general management. In a very small business the proprietor might cover<br>
all these areas, while perhaps contracting out functions like accounting. In a large company<br>
there maybe departments of people to do each function. Unless the key business functions<br>
are covered, the business will not be able to function for long.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">List ways that a business’s product/service may be promoted.<br>
Promotion, sales, marketing and advertising (all parts of promotion) is the most important<br>
function in a business. Without sales, and the promotional efforts that drive sales, the<br>
business quickly fails. The correct type of promotion depends on the type, location, size, and<br>
development stage of the business. There is no fool proof answer to successful promotion.<br>
Successful businesses carefully measure the return on their promotional efforts. They<br>
regularly try new methods of promotion and discard unsuccessful ones. They split test<br>
promotions to discover which advertisements and other promotions work better than others.<br>
If you pursue a business degree in University you can expect to take entire courses that just<br>
introduce fields like Advertising, Marketing, and Sales Management. You might even<br>
specialize an entire 4 year degrees in one of these closely related fields, so we can only give a<br>
very light overview here.<br>
Promotion includes:<br>
Advertising - usually paid efforts to get a specific message out<br>
TV and Radio (mass media)<br>
Magazine and Newspaper (print media)<br>
Web and New Media (online, social media) including Google Adwords, Facebook Ads,<br>
YouTube ads etc<br>
Direct mail and flyer services<br>
Billboards, bus benches, on transit vehicles (outdoor)<br>
Signs on the outside of the business<br>
Sponsorships - paid efforts to get the business or brand name more famous, but not with a<br>
specific call to action<br>
Sporting events, cultural events etc<br>
Buying naming rights to buildings (parks, sports stadiums, cultural centers etc)<br>
Promotion of charities (banks in Canada like to raise money for charities)<br>
Online Strategy<br>
Websites<br>
Facebook, Twitter etc profiles and pages<br>
YouTube channels<br>
Putting out content like videos and images that the business hopes will be shared and go<br>
viral<br>
email campaigns<br>
Online contests (almost all contests have an online component today)<br>
Direct Sales<br>
Door to door sales strategy<br>
Telephone sales or lead generation<br>
Multi-level marketing (Amway etc)<br>
Promotion through schools and other groups where the group becomes the sales force to<br>
raise money<br>
Booth at a craft market, community event etc that does direct sales<br>
Coupons and Special Offers<br>
Offering money off via a coupon<br>
Point of Purchase (POP) displays or in-store signage<br>
Attaching a rider product as a bonus on another product (product bundling)<br>
Service bundling (get a discount for buying your TV, phone and internet together)<br>
Loyalty programs and point or sticker collection programs<br>
Affiliate marketing (Amazon uses this in a big way, as does the insurance industry)<br>
Can you think of more promotional strategies within these categories, or even other<br>
categories?<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Show how you determine:<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Price of the product<br>
Price is a function primarily of what the target market is willing to pay (market price).<br>
You must first determine the market price and then determine if the business can<br>
profitably meet the market price after covering all expenses. If you can't make money,<br>
you need to find a new product, find ways to lower the cost, or find a different target<br>
market that will pay enough for the product.<br>
Break-even point<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5b<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">The break-even point (BEP) in economics, business, and specifically cost accounting, is<br>
the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal: there is no net loss or gain,<br>
and one has &quot;broken even.&quot; A profit or a loss has not been made, although opportunity<br>
costs have been &quot;paid&quot;, and capital has received the risk-adjusted, expected return. In<br>
short, all costs that needs to be paid are paid by the firm but the profit is equal to 0.<br>
For planning, you will need to figure out three numbers and then graph or spreadsheet<br>
them. These are:<br>
Expected average revenue per unit<br>
Fixed costs - those costs that stay the same regardless of how many or few units<br>
you sell. Rent, basic staff, and utilities are usually fixed costs.<br>
Variable costs, expressed per unit at various sales levels.<br>
There are actually two break even points. The first is a theoretical calculation of what<br>
level of sales in an accounting period (like a month or quarter) that results in the<br>
business no longer losing money. The second to occur is where the business has<br>
enough cumulative sales <em>over time </em>to offset all the expenses to date. It is also called<br>
getting out of the red and into the black because negative numbers in accounting<br>
reports are often printed in red ink while positive numbers are printed in black ink.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Profit/loss<br>
A budget showing the difference between all expected revenue and all expected<br>
expenses will show the projected profit or loss. An income statement shows actual<br>
income and expenses for an accounting period with the difference being the profit or<br>
loss.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Discuss ways in which the profits of a company can be used.<br>
Profits are used in one or a combination of these ways depending on the objectives of the<br>
company:<br>
dividends to shareholders<br>
to increase the working capital (cash on hand)<br>
to buy assets or otherwise invest in growing the business, including increases in<br>
receivables<br>
to retire debt<br>
If the business is not structured as a company, the profits go to the single owner or partners<br>
who may reinvest if they wish.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">7 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Brainstorm at least 4 ideas for small business that can be conducted by<br>
Pathfinders in your club or youth in your church. Evaluate the strengths,<br>
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with each of them.<br>
This requirement introduces the business concept of a </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">SWOT analysis</span><span style="color:#212529;">. SWOT is a popular<br>
way to evaluate business ideas and the business itself. While not a perfect tool, it is widely<br>
used in organizational decision making and can be very helpful.<br>
When doing SWOT, you make lists of internal and external factors influencing the plan or<br>
organization. Strengths and Weaknesses are internal while Opportunities and Threats are<br>
external.<br>
Every Pathfinder Club needs to bring in money, and every plan to bring in money is essentially<br>
a business plan. So let's run an example your own Club can expand on.<br>
Step 1: Generate ideas for a business. Write down even seemingly crazy ideas because they<br>
may prove practical or lead to a great idea. You might also combine ideas as you move<br>
through the process.<br>
Example ideas: flea market, car wash, making and selling quilts, building and selling bird<br>
houses.<br>
Step 2: Take the first idea - a flea market day at your gym to make money. The Club would go<br>
into the business of renting space and tables, as well as offering ancillary services. Is this a<br>
good idea? Let's do a SWOT Analysis to find out.<br>
Step 3: Start by everyone brainstorming points for the list of factors. Write them on a sheet of<br>
paper or a white board for all to see (which reduces duplication and encourages related<br>
ideas). Don't worry about classifying the points during the brainstorming but be thinking about<br>
Internal Strengths, and Weaknesses as well as External Opportunities and Threats. Here are<br>
some possible SWOT items.<br>
Strengths (internal):<br>
The club has 10 Pathfinders and 5 adults to advertise and run the sale<br>
Not a lot of skill needed<br>
Pathfinders have time (nothing else to do on Sunday)<br>
Earning this honor is motivational<br>
Might make $1000 dollars based on rough budget<br>
Weaknesses (internal):<br>
No one has any experience at this business<br>
Some Pathfinders are too young to help without a parent to help<br>
Takes up time that could be used for archery or camping or whatever<br>
Opportunities (external):<br>
People like to support a good cause and Pathfinders (framed as a &quot;youth program&quot;) is<br>
considered by everyone to be a good cause<br>
We can use the school gym, tables and chairs for free<br>
Facebook groups and walls are a good place to advertise free<br>
We can advertise with fliers while can collecting<br>
We promote the Pathfinder Club and possibly attract new members<br>
We introduce people to the Adventist School and adjoining church<br>
Threats (external):<br>
People might leave a lot of garbage<br>
If it snows, few will show up<br>
The public school two blocks away has a similar event the week before, so people might<br>
sell their stuff there instead<br>
The city might require a permit and might not approve it.<br>
Step 4: Categorize your list and weight it. While categorizing, you should see some things you<br>
missed, so add them. Don't just count up the S's and O's vs the W's and T's, you need to assign<br>
importance to them. Some threats are only remote or even not real for example. A big<br>
opportunity might be worth doing if there is limited threats and the weaknesses can be<br>
overcome. However a major weakness in an otherwise great idea can sink it.<br>
Step 5: Can you eliminate threats and fix weaknesses? Perhaps teaming up with another<br>
group or finding a donor is the answer.<br>
Step 6: Either make a decision (Yes or No), or compare to your SWOT on several other<br>
business ideas before making a decision.<br>
In this example, we also did a SWOT on the car wash, quilts and birdhouses. We decided that<br>
we could earn the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Woodworking </span><span style="color:#212529;">honor while building the birdhouses and than sell them at our<br>
flea market event. We also decided to sell veggie tacos at the event and have a display about<br>
our Pathfinder club.<br>
We decided that since we want to do the business in January, our Canadian location (a<br>
Weakness for the car wash idea) meant cold weather (a threat in the car wash idea) and that<br>
these two factors could lead to frozen Pathfinders which trumped all the Strengths and<br>
Opportunities for the car wash business idea.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Develop a business plan for at least one of your ideas from #7 above. Include the<br>
following in the plan:<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Description of business<br>
both a concise two or three sentences plus a more detailed analysis of<br>
how you plan to run the business<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Capital needed and the source of the capital<br>
will you use money on hand, borrow, or get investors?<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Price of the product/service<br>
determined through market research and your budgeted costs plus markup.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Target market<br>
who do you expect to buy your product or service? Define the target market as carefully<br>
as you can as this will help in everything from pricing to promotion strategy.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Promotional method<br>
this will be based on your product, where to best connect with your target market, and<br>
especially the resources available to you<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8f </span><span style="color:#212529;">Sales location<br>
this could be a specific place, a range of places (different retailers, door to door, or<br>
online)<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8g </span><span style="color:#212529;">Expected gains<br>
your budgeted profit - expected income less expected expenses including contingency<br>
for unexpected expenses. If you are not confident in a profit don't to the business!<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8h </span><span style="color:#212529;">Dissemination of profit<br>
what will you do with the expected profits. Will money go to the club? Do you need to<br>
share with your investors? Will you reinvest to build the business bigger?<br>
This is a good outline for any business plan. Every good business plan is written down<br>
and checked carefully. Are your assumptioms correct? Have you covered all your<br>
expected costs? As you execute your plan, check back to be sure you are following the<br>
plan.<br>
Business Plans are not meant to be written and then thrown in a drawer to be<br>
forgotten. Treat it as a living plan always subject to improvement. You may need to<br>
adjust the plan if circumstances turn out to be different than you planned, or if things<br>
change. Regualrly evaluate your business plan to see what assumptions need to be<br>
adjusted and to see how you did so you can improve the plan going forward.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">9 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Execute the plan.<br>

For your Pathfinder Club business you will want to assign different roles to the<br>
participants in the business. Someone should be the President/General Manager too to<br>
coordinate the other's work, hold people accountable for performance and help make<br>
difficult decisions<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">9b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Create the product<br>
The product could be a service or a physical product.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">9c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Advertise the product/service<br>
Look back at your promotion plans. You will likely want to try several promotion<br>
methods and test which work best<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">9d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Sell the product or perform the service<br>
This means getting money from real customers<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">9e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Report on profit/loss<br>
The report should be to your team, Pathfinder Club Director and to any investors or<br>
financial backers<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">9f </span><span style="color:#212529;">Report on use of profits<br>
You need to be accountable to the stakeholders. This might include reporting to your<br>
church (which likely includes many customers) and show them what you did with the<br>
profits. This will help with your next fundraiser.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">9g </span><span style="color:#212529;">Suggestions for improvements<br>
Evaluation of a business plan is really important because it helps you do even better<br>
next time. Where there any failures? What could be improved? Can you add in<br>
something that will make the project more profitable? Look at each part of the<br>
business and assess for improvement.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">10 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Discuss ethical issues and Christian values involved in conducting a business.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">10a </span><span style="color:#212529;">To God<br>
Everything belongs to God, including your business. Remember to treat God's business<br>
right and God will treat you right. Discuss what this means in the context of your plans.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">10b </span><span style="color:#212529;">To the government<br>
Some discussion starters. Do you have the appropriate licenses and permits? Does<br>
your business meet the zoning bylaws? Are you collecting and remitting taxes correctly<br>
(or are you exempt and why)? How can you be a good witness to government officials?<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">10c </span><span style="color:#212529;">To the customer<br>
Discussion starters include: How can you provide a quality product at a fair price to<br>
your customer? Can you find ways to witness and model Christ to your clients?<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">10d </span><span style="color:#212529;">To the employee<br>
The Christian businessperson should treat everyone around the business as they would<br>
like to be treated. Treat all employees honestly and fairly, and expect them to treat you<br>
honestly as well.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">11 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Recount the story of Joseph as a shrewd manager and businessman (Genesis<br>
41:39-57), the parable of the talents (Luke 19:11-26) or other similar bible<br>
passage. Identify three lessons from the story that can be applied to your<br>
business.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Genesis 41:39-57 Luke 19:11-26<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">Other stories to look at:<br>
Jacob's success while working for Laban. He used some kind of business plan for his farm<br>
that is hard to understand, but it worked </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Genesis 30</span><span style="color:#212529;">.<br>
As far as we can tell, Jesus called no synagogue preachers to be his closest disciples. Instead<br>
Jesus called at least 6 fishermen who owned boats and sold fish. He called Matthew, a<br>
businessman contracted to the Romans as a local tax collector. Even Judas seems to be a<br>
finance person for he was tasked with keeping the money.<br>
Jesus himself was a businessperson, part of a family business (though in English we read<br>
Jesus was a carpenter, the Greek word “tekton” actually describes a craftsman, one who<br>
constructs; a versatile builder and stone worker.) Perhaps this is why in His ministry Jesus<br>
demonstrated such a broad knowledge of business and why about 34 of his approximately 50<br>
recorded parables dealt with business, finance or workplace content for the illustration. Jesus<br>
told parables about many businesses including farming (sower, shepherds, etc), fishing,<br>
investing (parable of the talents) buying land (man found treasure, sold everything and bought<br>
the field), trading (pearl of great price), and more.<br>
Many of Jesus' public ministry appearances appear to have occurred in the marketplace and<br>
workplace.<br>
Paul, Priscilla and Aquila, operated a tent making business, so that none of them appear to<br>
have needed others to donate so they could preach. Lydia, a leader in the Philippian Church,<br>
was a textile dealer.<br>
James White sold Bibles, Bible Commentaries and other reference books in the frontier to<br>
support his and Ellen White's ministry. The Whites also invested in real estate and in preparing<br>
their own books for sale. Some were critical of the White's relative financial success, but an<br>
investigation into the White's finances found that they legitimately had been supporting<br>
themselves plus the infant church from their business endeavors.<br>
Other early Adventists often used businesses to support themselves. For example, Hiram<br>
Edson farmed during the summer to support himself while preaching. The Review and Herald<br>
and Pacific Press took in outside printing work to subsidize and support the religious work.<br>
The Kelloggs created breakfast cereal and built a famous company. Adventists also build a<br>
hospital system, book publishing empire, and ran many industries to support the school<br>
system.<br>
The SDA Church owns and operates many publishing houses, book centers, schools,<br>
hospitals, nursing homes, food factories (most famously Sanitarium Health Foods based in<br>
the South Pacific). The Church also owns substantial real estate around the world. Church<br>

administration (theologians) has proven to usually be poorly equipped to run businesses<br>
owned by the church, which is why professional well trained business people are vital to<br>
ensure that the businesses the church does own and operate are run accordingly to good<br>
business principles.<br>

1 </span><span style="color:#212529;">List equipment necessary for cake decorating.<br>
Decorating bags<br>
Small triangular shaped bags made from cloth, plastic or parchment paper which are fitted<br>
with decorating tips and filled with icing and used to pipe decorative items such as icing<br>
flowers, borders, scrollwork and lacework designs.<br>
Decorating tips and collars<br>
Sometimes called nozzles. These tips are used to create decorative items such as icing<br>
roses, shell borders, basketweave patterns and more. These come in various shapes and<br>
are used with an icing or pastry bag so that when the bag is squeezed the icing or cream<br>
is piped out in the shape of the tip, which may or may not be the final shape desired. For<br>
example, drop flowers are created with a single squeeze, while rose petals are created<br>
with skilled maneuvering. The collars are optional equipment that allow the tip to be<br>
changed without removing frosting from the bag.<br>
Frosting spatula<br>
Similar to a butter knife, but with smooth edges on the unsharpened blade. This is used to<br>
apply a smooth layer of frosting to a cake.<br>
Flower nail<br>
Shaped like a nail with an oversized head, this is used for piping royal icing and<br>
buttercream flowers onto before transferring to the cake.<br>
Cake platter<br>
A platter on which the cake sits as it is decorated and served. It can be as simple as a<br>
piece of corrugated cardboard covered with aluminum foil.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Learn from memory the two cake icings-butter cream and royal-and their proper<br>
uses. Name one other icing used for frosting.<br>
Buttercream Icing<br>
Buttercream Icing recipe is perfect for spreading or decorating.<br>
Butter Cream Icing<br>
Ingredients Procedure<br>
125 ml Butter, softened<br>
125 ml Shortening<br>
1000 ml Confectioner's<br>
sugar<br>
5 ml Vanilla extract<br>
30 ml Milk or cream<br>
Food coloring<br>
(Put mouse over calculator to<br>
get English measurements)<br>
Soften the butter by leaving it out of the<br>
refrigerator for a few hours before you need it.<br>
Place the butter and shortening in a mixing<br>
bowl and cream it with a mixer. Add the sugar,<br>
one cup at a time, beating it in as you go. Add<br>
the vanilla extract and milk and continue<br>
mixing.<br>
For a white frosting, substitute more shortening<br>
for the butter (that is, use 250 ml shortening,<br>
and no butter). For a tastier icing, substitute<br>
butter for shortening.<br>
Cover with a damp cloth until ready to use, or<br>
seal in an airtight container and refrigerate (it<br>
will keep for up to two weeks). Add food<br>
coloring as desired and mix it in thoroughly.<br>
Royal Icing<br>
This smooth, hard-drying icing is perfect for making decorations that last. It is also useful as a<br>
&quot;cement&quot; to fasten decorations together. Royal icing is edible, but not recommended for icing<br>
cakes.<br>
Royal Icing<br>
Ingredients Procedure<br>
1000 ml Confectioner's<br>
sugar<br>
45 ml Meringue powder<br>
2.5 ml Vanilla extract<br>
125-180 ml Warm water<br>
Food coloring<br>
(Put mouse over calculator to<br>
get English measurements)<br>
Combine the confectioner's sugar and the<br>
meringue powder in a large bowl and beat with<br>
an electric mixer. Add the water, vanilla extract,<br>
and food coloring and beat on medium to high<br>
speed until the icing forms stiff peaks (5-7<br>
minutes). Adjust the consistency by adding<br>
either more confectioner's sugar or more water.<br>
Use immediately, or cover in an airtight<br>
container and refrigerate. Royal icing hardens<br>
when exposed to air.<br>
Stabilized Whipped Cream Icing<br>
Stabilized Whipped Cream Icing<br>
Ingredients Procedure<br>
250 ml Heavy Whipping<br>
Cream<br>
30 ml Confectioners'<br>
Sugar<br>
2.5 ml Vanilla extract<br>
30 ml Piping Gel<br>
(Put mouse over calculator to<br>
get English measurements)<br>
Combine whipping cream and sugar in mixing<br>
bowl. Whip to soft peak stage. Add Piping Gel<br>
and vanilla, then continue to whip until stiff<br>
peaks form. Do not overbeat. Makes 1 1/2 to 2<br>
cups.<br>

Icing Consistency<br>
If the consistency of your decorating icing is not just right, your decorations won't be right<br>
either. Just a few drops of liquid will make a great deal of difference in your results.<br>
Correct Bag Position<br>
The way your decorations curl, point, and lie depends not only on the icing consistency but<br>
also on the way you hold the bag and the way you move it. Bag positions are described in<br>
terms of both angle and direction.<br>
Angle<br>
Angle refers to the position of the bag relative to the work surface. There are two basic<br>
angle positions.<br>
90° angle, or straight up, perpendicular to the surface. Used when making stars or flat<br>
petal flowers.<br>
45° angle, or half way between vertical and horizontal. Used for writing and borders.<br>
Direction<br>
The angle of the bag to the work surface is only half the story of the bag position. The<br>
other half is the direction in which the back of the bag is pointed. Correct bag direction<br>
is easiest to learn when you think of the back of the bag as the hour hand of a clock.<br>
When you hold the bag with the tip in the center of the clock, you can sweep out a<br>
circle with the back end of the bag. Pretend the circle you formed in the air is the clock<br>
face. The hours on the clock face correspond to the direction you point the back end of<br>
the bag.<br>
Pressure Control<br>
The size and uniformity of your icing designs are affected by the amount of pressure you<br>
apply to the bag and the steadiness of the pressure : how you squeeze and relax your grip<br>
on the decorating bag. Your goal is to learn to apply pressure so consistently that you can<br>
move the bag in a free and easy glide while just the right amount of icing flows through the<br>
tip. Practice will help you achieve this control.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Demonstrate pressure control with tubes. Learn the technique and name the<br>
proper tip (tube) used to make the following:<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Star, fill-in and border<br>
Use the star tube. Hold the bag in an upright position, and lightly touch the tip of the<br>
tube on the cake. Apply pressure to the bag until the dab of icing is the required size.<br>
Cease the pressure, and lift the tube quickly from the cake.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Cake Decorating - The Star Technique<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Rosette<br>
Use a star tip. Position the star tip just above the cake at a 90 degree angle. Squeeze<br>
out icing, making a small circle just large enough to leave a small opening at the center.<br>
When you return to the start of the circle, continue squeezing out icing as you spiral the<br>
star tip into the center of the circle. Stop squeezing and lift the star tip straight up from<br>
the center of the spiral.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Rose Swirl Cake Tutorial<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Shell border<br>
Use a star tip. Hold the icing bag at a 45 degree angle with the star tip just touching the<br>
cake. Squeeze the icing bag until the icing starts to make a small mound on the cake.<br>
Slowly start pulling the star tip away from the icing mound, and simultaneously<br>
decrease the pressure on the icing bag, until the &quot;stem&quot; is narrow. Stop squeezing out<br>
icing and remove the tip from the cake. This is one shell. To make a series of shells for<br>
a border, place the star tip over the narrow &quot;stem&quot; of the previous shell. Squeeze the<br>
icing bag until the icing starts to make a small mound on the cake that covers the<br>
unfinished &quot;stem&quot; of the previous shell. Continue by slowly pulling the star tip away<br>
from the icing mound, and simultaneously decrease the pressure on the icing bag, until<br>
the &quot;stem&quot; of the new shell is narrow. Stop squeezing out icing and remove the tip from<br>
the cake. Repeat until the desired number of shells have been made.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Slow Motion Cake Decorating! Borders<br>

Use a round tip or a star tip. Hold the bag at a 90 degree angle at the top perimeter of<br>
an iced cake. Gently squeeze the bag, directing the flow of icing to create a horizontal<br>
&quot;S&quot; shape near the edge of the cake's surface. Stop squeezing, and lift straight up to<br>
stop the flow of icing. Create another &quot;S&quot; shape next to the previous one, creating<br>
scrolls all the way around the perimeter of the cake. Let the icing harden for 15 minutes<br>
before moving the cake.<br>

Use a flat decorating tip, such as a rose petal tip or a leaf tip. Hold the icing bag at a 45<br>
degree angle, with the flat side of the decorating tip near the surface of the cake. Start<br>
to squeeze out some icing, then maintain consistent pressure on the bag as you<br>
simultaneously move the decorating tip away from the &quot;ribbon&quot;. You can vary the<br>
appearance of the ribbon by tipping the decorating tip slightly onto one edge, by<br>
moving the decorating tip gently from side to side to create &quot;ribbon waves&quot;, or in a<br>
partial circle to create a ribbon garland below a shell. If a rose petal tip is used for a<br>
ribbon, the wider edge of the tip is usually at the top of the ribbon.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5f </span><span style="color:#212529;">Zigzag border<br>
Use a star tip or round tip. Hold the decorating tip at a 45 degree angle. Maintain<br>
consistent pressure on the icing bag as you squeeze out the icing and simultaneously<br>
move the decorating tip back and forth in a zigzag motion. When the design is<br>
completed, stop the pressure and raise the decorating tip away from the cake. Note:<br>
always pull the tip AWAY from the design, not toward it.<br>

Use a leaf tip. Hold the tip at a 45 degree angle with the flat side of the tip toward the<br>
cake. Squeeze out icing and simultaneously pull the tip away. When the leaf is the right<br>
length release the pressure and lift the tip away from the leaf. For a slightly pointed<br>
leaf, slightly twist the tip as you release the pressure and lift the tip away from the leaf.<br>
To make a leaf that is slightly on its side, slightly tip the tip to one side.<br>

Use a rose petal tip and a flower nail.<br>
Add a small piece of waxed paper to the flat pedestal of the flower nail with a dot<br>
of frosting.<br>
Position the petal tube vertically in the center of the flower nail and begin lightly<br>
squeezing out frosting while twirling the flower nail with your fingers to make a<br>
small frosting cone.<br>
Once the cone is slightly taller than the width of the base of the cone, stop<br>
squeezing the bag and pull it away.<br>
Turn the bag at a 45-degree angle and position the petal tube about 1/3 of the way<br>
down from the top of the cone.<br>
Pipe a petal all the way around the cone at this angle for just one full turn of the<br>
flower nail so the ends of the petal are touching.<br>
Remove pressure and pull the bag away.<br>
Angle the piping bag at a 45-degree angle or slightly more and position the petal<br>
tube on one side of the cone.<br>
Squeeze the bag gently and pipe a ribbon of frosting about 1/3 of the way around<br>
the cone while spinning the flower nail to create a petal.<br>
Continue doing this until the rose is the size desired.<br>
Let the rose dry until it is slightly firm, and then transfer it onto your cake.<br>

1 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Explain the responsibilities of a Christian salesperson as related to how they treat<br>
their customers and boss.<br>
Christians strive to live according to the principles of the life of Christ and the Golden Rule.<br>
When dealing with customers, a Christian is honest and forthright, not withholding<br>
information or misleading people simply to gain a sale. A Christian is not high pressure and<br>
will not try to intimidate people into purchasing a service or product from them. Rather, he is<br>
empathetic and understanding of the customer's concerns and needs. He knows his product<br>
and its benefits thoroughly and is able to answer questions competently and quickly in order<br>
to help his customer make the decision that will best serve him.<br>
A Christian is courteous to his employer, and remembers that it is his place to serve. He will<br>
not cause strife in the work place and show angst toward his employer when talking with<br>
fellow employees or customers. A Christian will strive to put the best interest of the company<br>
at the forefront of his efforts by being professional and clean. He will discuss problems with<br>
the source and not spread rumors in the work place.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2 </span><span style="color:#212529;">List the points in the steps of a sale.<br>
Different authors have slightly different takes on the steps to a sale, but everyone agrees that<br>
they are something like this:<br>
1. Product Knowledge How can you lead someone to buy your product unless you understand<br>
it? The complexity of the product will determine how much effort this step requires. Selling<br>
cars requires more knowledge than selling ice cold bottled water on a hot summer day at the<br>
beach.<br>
2. Prospect for Leads<br>
You will need to figure out a way to find potential customers. Internet searches, industry<br>
associations, mailing lists, lists of past customers and lists of people who have contacted<br>
your company for information as a result of advertising are all possibilities. Alternatively you<br>
might decide to place yourself in front of prospective customers at a trade show or go where<br>
the customers are looking for your product (like that beach on a hot summer day with bottled<br>
water).<br>
3. Set an Appointment<br>
It's time to use those leads you collected in stage 2. Many salespeople prefer to cold call over<br>
the phone, but you can also call in person, send email or even mail out sales letters. If you are<br>
positioning yourself where customers come to you, be sure to be there at the right time (when<br>
the sun is shining at the beach for example)<br>
4. Qualify the Prospect<br>
The sooner you qualify, the sooner you can decided if the prospect is a potential customer.<br>
Are they the decision maker? Do they influence the decision maker? Can they afford the<br>
product? Do they need the product? The qualification stage starts when you are prospecting<br>
for leads, continues during the setting of the appointment and wraps up when you are<br>
convinced the prospect is qualified.<br>
5. Make Your Presentation<br>
The presentation is the core of every sales cycle, and it's probably where you'll invest the most<br>
preparation time. Keep in mind that you're not just selling your product... you are also selling<br>
yourself! You represent your company, so appearance counts.<br>
6. Address the Objections<br>
Here's where you get to deal with your prospect's concerns. Often the prospect wants to buy<br>
but has doubts. Your job is to help them address the concerns and doubts themselves by<br>
providing information and asking questions of your own, not get into an argument. The<br>
concern you'll hear most often? “I have to think about it.”<br>
7. Close the Sale<br>
Once you've made your presentation and answered your prospect's questions and objections,<br>
it's time to ask for the sale. Instead of saying &quot;So you want to buy this?&quot; you might close the<br>
sale by asking indirect questions like &quot;would you prefer the red one or the blue one?&quot; or &quot;Is<br>
regular shipping ok or do you need a faster delivery?&quot;. Some salespeople will start filling out<br>
the order form and ask questions like &quot;what business name do you want on the order?&quot;<br>
Remember, the prospect often wants you to help them buy. This is the second-most neglected<br>
stage of the sales cycle... which is especially sad given that it's probably the most critical one.<br>
8. Ask for Referrals This is hands down the most commonly neglected step. Too many<br>
salespeople are so relieved to get a sale that they grab their things and race out the door the<br>
second they get the chance, for fear the prospect will change their mind!<br>

Objections are often questions that just need to be answered. Ideally, you want to help the<br>
buyer answer his/her own questions and objections rather than answering the objections<br>
yourself. People believe their own voice more than someone else's.<br>
Since this requirement calls for the Pathfinder to give their own statement, we suggest first<br>
studying a good book on sales principles like </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">this one </span><span style="color:#212529;">by Christian salesperson, speaker and<br>
author Zig Zigler. Now sadly no longer with us, Zigler explains how to sell in a humorous and<br>
memorable way.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">How are the following points valuable to a salesperson?<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Researching the market to see how an item or service will sell<br>
Understanding the market requires research to understand what the market (the<br>
customers) need and want and how they are meeting these needs and wants. If you do<br>
not understand what alternatives the customer has to your product how can you<br>
differentiate between your product and other products they could buy instead? Each<br>
product or service must be positioned in the market (price, quality, quantity, etc.) and<br>
the product position should be reviewed regularly as the market changes over time.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Proper training and knowledge about the item or service to be sold<br>
Proper knowledge and training helps in three major ways:<br>
1. It streamlines the sales process. Having to call the plant or check the literature<br>
breaks up the sales call and costs valuable time. It is much easier to just answer a<br>
question immediately.<br>
2. It builds trust. A properly trained salesperson who knows the product appears<br>
professional, knowledgeable and trustworthy - all good qualities that increase the<br>
comfort level in the buyer. Buyers prefer to deal with someone they can trust, even<br>
refusing to buy something they actually want if they don't trust the salesperson.<br>
3. It prevents problems. Product misrepresentation can be costly for the buyer and can<br>
kill the company's representation. It can lead to legal battles and other undesirable<br>
consequences, all of which proper training and product knowledge can prevent.<br>

Visiting the plant or home office helps the salesperson in several ways:<br>
a) Helps them understand the product and the company better. Seeing something<br>
made (or service provided) helps the salesperson later explain the quality of the<br>
product, limitations of the product and capabilities of the business in general.<br>
b) results in personal connections to key people at the plant/head office, connections<br>
that can be used later to get technical info, solve problems and generally provide better<br>
customer service<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Follow-up visits with first-time customers<br>
The sales cycle for most things does not complete with the sale. Follow-up ensures<br>
that the customer is satisfied, allows the salesperson to proactively fix any problems<br>
and collects valuable feedback. A follow-up call or visit also is a great time to see if the<br>
customer would like to buy more of the product (many customers place a small order<br>
at first as a test) and to ask for referrals.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Using actual or hypothetical education and experience, write a resume which<br>
could be used in applying for a job.<br>
A resume is an important sales tool for selling a really important service - your time. You can<br>
start your research on writing a </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">resume on Wikipedia</span><span style="color:#212529;">.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Find out what education is most beneficial for a career in sales. What aspects of<br>
sales are available to a Christian salesperson?<br>
For general sales a college course or degree in sales and marketing is good start. A Business<br>
Administration degree will also prepare you well for a sales career. For very technical<br>
products, some companies prefer trained engineers or other experts in the business.<br>
Since you need to find out what education is beneficial, you need to do some research. You<br>
can start by exploring the courses offered by </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Andrews University School of Business<br>
Administration </span><span style="color:#212529;">or another university near you.<br>
A Christian salesperson can be involved in every aspect of sales including jobs like:<br>
a) Inside Sales<br>
b) Outside Sales<br>
c) Sales Manager/VP Sales<br>
d) Marketing jobs<br>
e) Retail sales jobs<br>
f) Traveling sales person<br>
g) Working in a sales call center<br>
h) Prospecting for leads or taking calls from interested people and closing the sales<br>
i) Becoming an independent salesperson, such as a Realtor or </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Manufacturers Sales<br>
Representative<br>

However, Christians should avoid working selling products or services that go against<br>
Christian Principles and personal beliefs. Selling for a tobacco firm, winery or adult<br>
entertainment company would not be appropriate. Misrepresenting products or selling<br>
products that do not provide good value (like scams) is inappropriate. If in doubt, don't do it. A<br>
good test is - would Jesus approve? Will my mother approve? There are so many<br>
opportunities to sell products and services that people want and need and that will improve<br>
their lives there is just no reason to stoop to selling something harmful or that does not<br>
represent good value.<br>

Selling something to your mom and barely doing your part is not enough to<br>
demonstrate your Christian Sales abilities. To earn the honor you should go beyond the<br>
minimum effort. Happy selling.<br>

All businesses and professions involve some sort of selling. Without selling goods and<br>
services are not exchanged. You might earn money for school, some special treat, or<br>
just for living expenses. If you have the opportunity and are at least 16 consider joining<br>

works.<br>
Cameras work with the light of the visible spectrum. A<br>
camera generally consists of some kind of enclosed<br>
hollow, with an opening or aperture at one end for light to<br>
enter, and a recording or viewing surface for capturing the<br>
light at the other end. Most cameras have a lens<br>
positioned in front of the camera's opening to gather the<br>
incoming light and to focus the image (or part of the<br>
image), on the recording surface. The diameter of the<br>
aperture is often controlled by a diaphragm mechanism,<br>
but some cameras have a fixed-size aperture.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Digital cameras </span><span style="color:#212529;">use electronics, usually a charge coupled device (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">CCD</span><span style="color:#212529;">) or sometimes a<br>
Complementary Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor (</span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">CMOS</span><span style="color:#212529;">) sensor to capture images which<br>
can be transferred or stored in computer memory inside the camera for later playback<br>
or processing.<br>
Here are </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">more technical details </span><span style="color:#212529;">on how the image is captured.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1b </span><span style="color:#212529;">The effect of light on an image sensor.<br>

to an electric signal. It is used in digital cameras (as well<br>
as other imaging devices). It is usually an array of chargecoupled devices (CCD) or CMOS sensors such as active<br>
pixel sensors.<br>
There are several main types of color image sensors,<br>
differing by the means of the color separation mechanism:<br>
Bayer sensor, low-cost and most common, using a<br>
Bayer filter that passes red, green, or blue light to<br>
selected pixels, forming interlaced grids sensitive to<br>
red, green, and blue. The image is then interpolated<br>
using a demosaicing algorithm.<br>
Foveon X3 sensor, using an array of layered sensors where every pixel contains<br>
three stacked sensors sensitive to the individual colors.<br>
3CCD, using three discrete image sensors, with the color separation done by a<br>
dichroic prism. Considered the best quality, and generally more expensive than<br>
single-CCD sensors.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Bayer Filter<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">A Bayer filter mosaic is a color filter array (CFA) for arranging RGB color filters on a<br>
square grid of photosensors. The word comes from the name of its inventor, Dr. Bryce<br>
E. Bayer of Eastman Kodak, and describes an arrangement of color filters used in most<br>
single-chip digital image sensors used in digital cameras, camcorders, and scanners to<br>
create a color image. The filter pattern is 50% green, 25% red and 25% blue, and is also<br>
called RGBG or GRGB.<br>
Bryce Bayer's patent called the green photosensors <em>luminance-sensitive elements </em>and<br>
the red and blue ones <em>chrominance-sensitive elements</em>. He used twice as many green<br>
elements as red or blue to mimic the human eye's greater resolving power with green<br>
light. These elements are referred to as <em>sensor elements</em>, <em>pixel sensors</em>, or simply <em>pixels</em>.<br>
The raw output of Bayer-filter cameras is referred to as a <em>Bayer pattern </em>image. Since<br>
each pixel is filtered to record only one of three colors, two-thirds of the color data is<br>
missing from each. To obtain a full-color image, the red, green, and blue values are<br>
combined for each point.<br>
Different algorithms for combining the three colors require various amounts of<br>
computing power and result in varying-quality final images. This can be done incamera, producing a JPEG or TIFF image, or outside the camera using the raw data<br>
directly from the sensor.<br>
This image went through this<br>
And became these:<br>

To reconstruct a color image from the data collected by the color filtering array, you<br>
need to fill in the blanks. The mathematics here is subject to individual implementation,<br>
and is called </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">demosaicing</span><span style="color:#212529;">. If you have a RAW image, you can use different<br>

Camera Lens<br>
A </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">camera lens </span><span style="color:#212529;">usually has an aperture adjustment mechanism to<br>
control the amount of light that may pass. It also has a shutter, to<br>
control the length of time during which light may pass through<br>
the lens.<br>
Focal Length<br>
The focal length is a measure of how strongly it converges (focuses) or<br>
diverges light. A shorter focal length has greater optical power than one<br>
with a long focal length.<br>
In the photos below, the camera did not move, but the camera lens was<br>
changed as noted.<br>
When a lens with a shorter focal length is used, there is a wider<br>

The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">aperture </span><span style="color:#212529;">stop is an extremely important element in most<br>
optical designs. Its most obvious feature is that it limits the<br>
amount of light that can reach the image plane. This can either<br>
be undesired, as in a telescope where one wants to collect as<br>
much light as possible; or deliberate, to prevent saturation of a<br>
detector or overexposure of film. In both cases, the size of the<br>
aperture stop is constrained by things other than the amount of<br>
light admitted, however:<br>
The size of the stop is one factor that affects </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">depth of field</span><span style="color:#212529;">. Smaller stops produce a<br>
longer depth of field, allowing objects at a wide range of distances to all be in focus at the<br>
same time.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Describe pixels, image resolution, and image size.<br>
A pixel is generally<br>
thought of as the<br>
smallest complete<br>
sample of an image.<br>
The definition is<br>
highly context<br>
sensitive; for<br>
example, we can<br>
speak of printed<br>
pixels in a page, or<br>
pixels carried by electronic signals, or represented by digital values, or pixels on a display<br>
device, or pixels in a digital camera (photosensor elements). This list is not exhaustive, and<br>
depending on context there are several synonyms that are accurate in particular contexts, e.g.<br>
pel, sample, byte, bit, dot, spot, etc. We can also speak of pixels in the abstract, or as a unit of<br>
measure, in particular when using pixels as a measure of resolution, e.g. 2400 pixels per inch,<br>
640 pixels per line, or spaced 10 pixels apart.<br>
The measures </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">dots per inch </span><span style="color:#212529;">(dpi) and </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">pixels per inch </span><span style="color:#212529;">(ppi) are sometimes used<br>
interchangeably, but have distinct meanings especially in the printer field, where dpi is a<br>
measure of the printer's resolution of dot printing (e.g. ink droplet density). For example, a<br>
high-quality inkjet image may be printed with 200 ppi on a 720 dpi printer.<br>
The more pixels used to represent an image, the closer the result can resemble the original.<br>
The number of pixels in an image is sometimes called the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">resolution</span><span style="color:#212529;">, though resolution has a<br>
more specific definition. Pixel counts can be expressed as a single number, as in a &quot;threemegapixel&quot; </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">digital camera</span><span style="color:#212529;">, which has a nominal three million pixels, or as a pair of numbers,<br>
as in a &quot;640 by 480 display&quot;, which has 640 pixels from side to side and 480 from top to<br>
bottom (as in a </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">VGA </span><span style="color:#212529;">display), and therefore has a total number of 640 × 480 = 307,200 pixels<br>
or 0.3 megapixels.<br>
The pixels, or color samples, that form a digitized image (such as a </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">JPEG </span><span style="color:#212529;">file used on a web<br>
page) may or may not be in one-to-one correspondence with </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">screen pixels</span><span style="color:#212529;">, depending on how<br>
a computer displays an image.<br>
In computing, an image composed of pixels is known as a </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;"><em>bitmapped image </em></span><span style="color:#212529;">or a </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;"><em>raster image</em></span><span style="color:#212529;">.<br>
The word <em>raster </em>originates from </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">halftone </span><span style="color:#212529;">printing technology, and has been widely used to<br>
describe </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">television scanning </span><span style="color:#212529;">patterns.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">What are the two types of image compression?<br>
There are many image compression algorithms, but they can all be neatly divided into one of<br>
two types: lossless and lossy.<br>
Lossless Compression<br>
In lossless compression, when the image is restored from the compressed format, it is an<br>
                                                      <em>exact binary match </em>to the original. Every bit is exactly the same as in the original. Examples of<br>
lossless image compression file formats include:<br>

Lossy Compression<br>
With lossy compression, the uncompressed image is <em>not </em>exactly the same, but it can be very<br>
difficult to tell the difference with the naked eye. By permanently throwing away some of the<br>
information in the image, the file can be made much smaller.<br>

Major graphic file formats<br>
There are many graphic file formats, if we include the proprietary types. The PNG, JPEG, and<br>
GIF formats are most often used to display images on the Internet. These graphic formats are<br>
listed and briefly described below, separated into the two main families of graphics: raster and<br>
vector.<br>
Raster formats<br>
For a description of the technology aside from the format, see </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Raster graphics</span><span style="color:#212529;">.<br>
JPEG<br>
The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">JPEG </span><span style="color:#212529;">(Joint Photographic Experts Group) image files are a lossy format. The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">DOS<br>
filename extension </span><span style="color:#212529;">is <em>JPG</em>, although other </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">operating systems </span><span style="color:#212529;">may use <em>JPEG</em>. Nearly all digital<br>
cameras have the option to save images in JPEG format. The JPEG format supports 8-bit per<br>
color - red, green, and blue, for 24-bit total - and produces relatively small file sizes.<br>
Fortunately, the compression in most cases does not detract noticeably from the image. But<br>
JPEG files do suffer generational degradation when repeatedly edited and saved.<br>
Photographic images are best stored in a lossless non-JPEG format if they will be re-edited in<br>
future, or if the presence of small &quot;artifacts&quot; (blemishes), due to the nature of the JPEG<br>
compression algorithm, is unacceptable. JPEG is also used as the image compression<br>
algorithm in many Adobe PDF files.<br>
TIFF<br>
The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">TIFF </span><span style="color:#212529;">(Tagged Image File Format) is a flexible image format that normally saves 16-bit per<br>
color - red, green and blue for a total of 48-bits - or 8-bit per color - red, green and blue for a<br>
total of 24-bits - and uses a filename extension of <em>TIFF </em>or <em>TIF</em>. TIFF's flexibility is both a feature<br>
and a curse, with no single reader capable of handling all the different varieties of TIFF files.<br>
TIFF can be lossy or lossless. Some types of TIFF offer relatively good lossless compression<br>
for </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">bi-level (black and white, no grey) images</span><span style="color:#212529;">. Some high-end digital cameras have the option<br>
to save images in the TIFF format, using the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">LZW </span><span style="color:#212529;">compression algorithm for lossless storage.<br>
The TIFF image format is not widely supported by web browsers, and should not be used on<br>
the World Wide Web. TIFF is still widely accepted as a photograph file standard in the printing<br>
industry. TIFF is capable of handling device-specific color spaces, such as the CMYK defined<br>
by a particular set of printing press inks.<br>
RAW<br>
The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">RAW image format </span><span style="color:#212529;">is a file option available on some digital cameras. It usually uses a<br>
lossless compression and produces file sizes much smaller than the TIFF format.<br>
Unfortunately, the RAW format is not standard among all camera manufacturers and some<br>
graphic programs and image editors may not accept the RAW format. The better graphic<br>
editors can read some manufacturer's RAW formats, and some (mostly higher-end) digital<br>
cameras also support saving images in the TIFF format directly. Adobe's </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Digital Negative<br>
Specification </span><span style="color:#212529;">is a recent (September 2004) attempt at standardizing the various &quot;raw&quot; file<br>
formats used by digital cameras.<br>
PNG<br>
The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">PNG </span><span style="color:#212529;">(Portable Network Graphics) file format is regarded, and was made as, the free and<br>
open-source successor to the GIF file format. The PNG file format supports true color (16<br>
million colors) whereas the GIF file format only allows 256 colors. PNG excels when the image<br>
has large areas of uniform color. The lossless PNG format is best suited for editing pictures,<br>
and the lossy formats like JPG are best for final distribution of photographic-type images<br>
because of smaller file size. </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Many older browsers </span><span style="color:#212529;">do not yet support the PNG file format,<br>
however with the release of </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Internet Explorer 7 </span><span style="color:#212529;">all popular modern browsers fully support<br>
PNG. The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Adam7</span><span style="color:#212529;">-interlacing allows an early preview even when only a small percentage of<br>
the data of the image has been transmitted.<br>
GIF<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">GIF </span><span style="color:#212529;">(Graphic Interchange Format) is limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors. This makes the<br>
GIF format suitable for storing graphics with relatively few colors such as simple diagrams,<br>
shapes and cartoon style images. The GIF format supports animation and is still widely used<br>
to provide image animation effects. It also uses a lossless compression that is more effective<br>
when large areas have a single color, and ineffective for detailed images or </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">dithered </span><span style="color:#212529;">images.<br>
BMP<br>
The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">BMP </span><span style="color:#212529;">(bit mapped) format is used internally in the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Microsoft Windows </span><span style="color:#212529;">operating system<br>
to handle graphics images. These files are typically not compressed resulting in large files.<br>
The main advantage of BMP files is their wide acceptance, simplicity, and use in Windows<br>
programs. However, they may pose problems for users of other operating systems.<br>
Commonly, BMP files are used for Microsoft's Paint program. Since most BMP files are<br>
uncompressed, and BMP's RLE compression has serious limits, the large size of BMP files<br>
makes them unsuitable for file transfer. However, Bit Map images are suitable for background<br>
images and wallpapers. This is especially true for screen shots. In addition, images from<br>
scanners are usually stored in BMP files.<br>
HDP<br>
The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">HDP </span><span style="color:#212529;">format <em>(formally known as WDP) </em>is the newly introduced image format by Microsoft<br>
for media print quality, lossless image compression. This image standard has a specific<br>
applicability to mostly print media due to its size although it is rumored to be the standard for<br>
Microsoft Office 2007 and the brand new Windows Vista operating system. This format is<br>
very similar to the TIFF format, but can handle a much larger range of image types and<br>
qualities such as 8, 16, and 32 bits per channel processing, N-Channel support, and embedded<br>
tiling.<br>
XPM<br>
The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">XPM </span><span style="color:#212529;">format is the default </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">X Window System </span><span style="color:#212529;">picture format (very popular in the Linux<br>
world). Its structure is based on the string format of the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">C programming language</span><span style="color:#212529;">. Because<br>
XPM was designed to be human-readable, and is stored as uncompressed plain-text, the file<br>
size of these pictures can be more than twice as large as uncompressed binary bitmap files<br>
(such as BMP, uncompressed TIFF, MacOS-PICT, or Irix-RGB formats). This format is<br>
unsupported by most non-Unix software and operating systems (though many web-browsers<br>
retain display support for the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">XBM </span><span style="color:#212529;">subset, which was the minimal image format in the early<br>
days of the WWW).<br>
MrSID<br>
The </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">MrSID </span><span style="color:#212529;">(Multiresolution Seamless Image Database) format is a </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">wavelet compression<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">format used mostly by </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Geographic Information Systems </span><span style="color:#212529;">to store massive </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">satellite imagery </span><span style="color:#212529;">for<br>
map software.<br>
Vector formats<br>
As opposed to the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">raster </span><span style="color:#212529;">image formats above (where the data describes the characteristics<br>
of each individual pixel), </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">vector </span><span style="color:#212529;">image formats contain a geometric description which can be<br>
rendered smoothly at any desired display size.<br>
Vector file formats can contain bitmap data as well. </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">3D graphic </span><span style="color:#212529;">file formats are technically<br>
vector formats with pixel data </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">texture mapping </span><span style="color:#212529;">on the surface of a vector virtual object,<br>
warped to match the angle of the viewing perspective.<br>
At some point, all vector graphics must be rasterized in order to be displayed on digital<br>
monitors. However vector images can be displayed with analog </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">CRT </span><span style="color:#212529;">technology such as that<br>
used in some </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">electronic test equipment</span><span style="color:#212529;">, </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">medical monitors</span><span style="color:#212529;">, </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">radar </span><span style="color:#212529;">displays, </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">laser shows </span><span style="color:#212529;">and<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">early video games</span><span style="color:#212529;">. </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Plotters </span><span style="color:#212529;">are printers that use vector data rather than pixel data to draw<br>
graphics.<br>
SVG<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">SVG </span><span style="color:#212529;">(Scalable Vector Graphics) is an </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">open standard </span><span style="color:#212529;">created and developed by the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">World<br>
Wide Web Consortium </span><span style="color:#212529;">to address the need (and attempts of several corporations) for a<br>
versatile, </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">scriptable </span><span style="color:#212529;">and all-purpose vector format for the web and otherwise. The SVG format<br>
does not have a compression scheme of its own, but due to the textual nature of </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">XML</span><span style="color:#212529;">, an SVG<br>
graphic can be compressed using a program such as </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">gzip</span><span style="color:#212529;">. Because of its scripting potential,<br>
SVG is a key component in </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">web applications</span><span style="color:#212529;">: interactive web pages that look and act like<br>
applications.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Give the principal uses of photography:<br>
Photography is used primarily for the following purposes: Recording events -- whether a<br>
campout, a family picnic, or other event, photography allows us to record the people and<br>
events involved. Later, we can &quot;remember&quot; by viewing the images/pictures.<br>
Art appreciation -- Landscape, macro (close-up) photography, and other artistic photography<br>
allows a photographer to share their impressions of the world with friends and associates<br>
The definition of Photography is as follows: Photography [fә'tɑgrәfi:],[foʊ'tɑgrәfi:] is the<br>
process of recording pictures by means of capturing light on a light-sensitive medium, such<br>
as a film or sensor. Light patterns reflected or emitted from objects expose a sensitive<br>
chemical or electronic medium during a timed exposure, usually through a photographic lens<br>
in a device known as a camera that also stores the resulting information chemically or<br>
electronically.<br>
Notice that almost nothing<br>
is sharp because the<br>
camera was not steady<br>
when the photo was taken<br>
The word comes from the Greek words φως <em>phos </em>(&quot;light&quot;), and γραφίς <em>graphis </em>(&quot;stylus&quot;,<br>
&quot;paintbrush&quot;) or γραφή <em>graphê </em>(&quot;representation by means of lines&quot; or &quot;drawing&quot;), together<br>
meaning &quot;drawing with light.&quot; Traditionally, the product of photography has been called a<br>
                                                      <em>photograph</em>, commonly shortened to <em>photo</em>.<br>
Photography gained the interest of many scientists and artists from its inception. Scientists<br>
have used photography to record and study movements, such as </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Eadweard Muybridge</span><span style="color:#212529;">'s study<br>
of human and animal locomotion in 1887. Artists are equally interested by these aspects but<br>
also try to explore avenues other than the photo-mechanical representation of reality, such as<br>
the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">pictorialist </span><span style="color:#212529;">movement. Military, police and security forces use photography for<br>
surveillance, recognition and data storage. Photography is used to preserve memories of<br>
favorites and as a source of entertainment.<br>

When we use our eyes, we see the world in three dimensions. The biggest reason for<br>
this is because we have two eyes about 1 1/2&quot; apart that give us &quot;two photos&quot; that our<br>
brain then interprets as being three-dimensional--big objects are closer than small<br>
objects.<br>
However, cameras only have one &quot;eye&quot; the lens, so we have to intentionally take<br>
pictures that are &quot;extra&quot; 3-dimensional. One way we can do this by Framing.<br>
Framing uses some element in the photograph to act as a foreground or middledistance frame which overlaps or highlights the main subject of your photo.<br>
For example, if you're taking a picture of rolling hills, give your picture &quot;depth&quot; by putting<br>
a tree or fence post that is closer to you on the right or left hand side of the<br>
photograph.<br>
Other examples of Frames include: a tree branch, rocks on a seashore, a friend or an<br>
archway.<br>

Have you ever gotten pictures developed and all you see is<br>
a &quot;blur&quot; that was supposed to be a family member? Maybe<br>
you've taken a picture through the window of a car while<br>
its been moving. This is called camera blur and is most<br>
often caused when you're using a &quot;fancy&quot; SLR camera<br>
where the exposure setting is 1/125th of a second or<br>
slower. However, it can also happen when you don't<br>
practice good &quot;camera posture&quot; when composing your<br>
photograph.<br>
When you're taking pictures, is very important that the camera doesn't wiggle as you<br>
take the picture! Some helpful hints for keeping this from happening are:<br>
Use both hands to steady the camera. One-handed picture taking is hazardous to<br>
your photographic health!<br>
If you're using a fancy SLR camera, be sure your exposure time is set equal to or<br>
greater than your film speed (ex. If you're using 200 speed film, have it set to 1/250,<br>
Example of sun glaring into<br>
the camera<br>
1/500, or 1/1000). Otherwise use a table, wall or something else steady to steady<br>
yourself as you take the photo.<br>
Most point-and-shoot cameras have this film/exposure time ratio &quot;built-in&quot; to their<br>
cameras.<br>
The best way to hold a camera in a comfortable position but rigidly is to form an<br>
imaginary tripod with the camera pressed against your forehead and your elbows<br>
against your body. Take a breath, partially exhale, and gently press the shutter<br>
button.<br>
Be careful not to get any of your fingers or the camera chord in front of the flash or<br>
the lens!!<br>

Direction of lighting, Quality of Lighting, &amp; Rule of Thirds<br>
Quiz question (not really. . .) Should the sun be behind the<br>
subject you're photographing, beside the subject, or<br>
shining on the subject?<br>
People used to think that you could only take good<br>
pictures if the sun was behind the photographer (YOU!)<br>
shining on the subject they were taking a picture. But<br>
that's not true.<br>
For instance, if you want to take a sunset picture and want your framing subject (such<br>
as a person walking down the beach) to be a silhouette, the sun should be behind him,<br>
shining toward you (back lighting).<br>
Lighting:<br>
                                                      <em>Front lighting </em>is best when you want to see the details, like if you're taking a close-up of<br>
someone's face. A downfall is, that if the lights too bright, such as in the middle of the<br>
day, there might be &quot;glare&quot; in your subject.<br>
                                                      <em>Side lighting </em>is great for bringing out shapes and textures, such as a rocky mountain<br>
cliff or tree bark. These two photos are from Mono Lake In California. Notice how<br>
different the same rocks look depending on where the light is coming from?<br>
                                                      <em>Back lighting </em>is lighting from behind the subject, tends to hide the subject, forming a<br>
silhouette. Some good places to use back lighting are a camporee flagpole at sunset, a<br>
cow/horse grazing at sunset, or a playground after everyone has gone home for the<br>
evening.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">7d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Quality of light - shade, sunlight, and time of day.<br>
The best light conditions are 1 1/2 hours before sunset or the first hour after<br>
sunrise. The reason is that the light isn't SO BRIGHT that it washes out the colors in<br>
your picture, but at the same time the shadows are long (which makes side lighting<br>
pictures look extra special). Also, the sunset or sunrise gives off a kind of &quot;pink&quot; or<br>
&quot;orange&quot; light, which makes many nature pictures look very friendly &amp; special. If you<br>
want to know when sunrise and sunset are going to be, check out<br>
www.adventist.org's sunset calendar!<br>
Be careful of evening shadows when photographing people. long shadows on<br>
faces hide features and expressions!<br>
Pictures taken during the middle of the day will be &quot;stark&quot; with hard lines and<br>
minimal shadows. Buildings &amp; some landscapes such as mountains look<br>
especially regal or majestic during the middle of the day. Just remember that if you<br>
take a picture during the middle of the day, shade the top of the lens of your<br>
camera by placing one of your hands or a piece of paper horizontal about 2&quot; above<br>
the lens to form a &quot;shade for the lens. This will keep pink &amp; blue &quot;sparks&quot; from<br>
showing up on your photos.<br>
When there is no sunshine (on a rainy day) don't give up on taking pictures! Zoom<br>
in close on flowers and other colorful objects. The color will be extra deep since its<br>
not being &quot;washed out&quot; by the sun. Fog which often accompanies soft rain also<br>
makes a very nice soft hazy look. Just be sure to protect you lens from specks of<br>
rain!<br>

A photo divided into<br>
thirds<br>
Sky taking top twothirds<br>
Sky taking top onethird<br>
A Picture looks best when you imagine a tic-tac-toe board on top of your picture you're<br>
going to take. Remember that we're wanting a photo to look 3 dimensional! Part of that<br>
is arranging it in combination with &quot;Framing&quot; and &quot;Leading Lines&quot; techniques, but<br>
putting objects in &quot;3rds&quot; on the photo.<br>
For example: In a mountain scene the landscape in the bottom screen--maybe even a<br>
tree or rock to help it look &quot;more 3-D&quot;-- the mountains in the middle 3rd, and the sky in<br>
the top third.<br>
Another Illustration: If you're taking a picture of a landscape with puffy clouds, take one<br>
picture where 2/3 of the picture is composed of the clouds and the landscape fills the<br>
bottom 1/3. Then try with 1/3 clouds and 2/3 landscape. Notice how different this<br>
same landscape looks with the &quot;3rds&quot; changed from top to bottom!<br>

Subjects look different depending on where you are in relation to them when you take<br>
the picture.<br>
You'll need three photos for this requirement, though they don't have to be of the same<br>
object. A High-angle, Mid-angle, and Low-angle photograph.<br>
                                                      <em>High angle means: </em>looking down on your subject<br>
                                                      <em>Mid-angle means: </em>looking at your subject straight on.<br>
                                                      <em>Low-angle means: </em>looking up at your subject<br>
The path leads you to the<br>
monument<br>
For this requirement, take a subject, such as some tall straight trees, and take a picture<br>
looking straight at them, then another one by laying on the ground looking up through<br>
the trees. Did the angle make a difference?<br>

Have you ever taken a picture of a beautiful flower or some animals but when the photo<br>
came back, you had to explain to friends &quot;that dot is a pretty rose,&quot; and &quot;that dot over<br>
there is a buffalo.&quot;?<br>
Filling the frame is all about making your subject (what you're taking a picture of) fill up<br>
most of the picture frame. This means standing closer to the subject than you're<br>
ordinarily used to doing and making sure there's not a lot of &quot;green space&quot; around your<br>
subject.<br>
Some ideas for Pathfinders:<br>
Take a picture of your whole youth group. Be sure there are some standing and<br>
some standing/sitting in front of them. Then, get close enough so that there is<br>
almost NO &quot;background green space&quot; around them. You'll be impressed with how<br>
nice it is to have a photo that shows the expressions on everybody's face.<br>
Take a picture of your best friend while they're eating at a campout or lockin. Don't<br>
try to take a picture of the whole room, but zoom in on their upper body and the top<br>
of the table with the plate of food. You'll both laugh when you see the photo that<br>
shows how shocked your friend was at your &quot;surprise&quot; picture.<br>

Leading lines are anything in a photograph that will help<br>
lead your eyes towards the main subject. For example, do<br>
you want people eyes to travel &quot;down the road into the<br>
sunset, just like the bus is doing? Or, do you want people to<br>
see the big cafeteria on the hill where you and your fellow<br>
pathfinders ate all weekend?<br>
Leading Lines also help your photograph's &quot;depth.&quot; If your<br>
eyes are able to wander into the picture, then your brain<br>
will think the picture looks more real, like the real 3-D world<br>
we live in.<br>
Ideas for Pathfinders:<br>
Example of how the<br>
reflection of the flash can<br>
disrupt the photo<br>
Roads: take a picture of a windy road that leads to nowwhere; The road that leads<br>
to camporee or the road into the campsite you're staying at this weekend may also<br>
be a good leading line.<br>
Trails<br>
Fence Posts / Fence lines<br>
Tall buildings or tall trees. Take pictures straight up, and use those tall lines to<br>
guide your eyes to a Mountain peak, or to the sun / moon shining overhead.<br>

Most flashes should be used no closer to a subject than 6<br>
feet. and more than 20 feet away. Any closer and it will<br>
&quot;wash out&quot; your subject, (depending on flash), and any<br>
farther away, the light won't even reach. For example: Have<br>
you ever seen people use a flash at a football game, or in a<br>
large stadium in hopes of getting photos of the people on<br>
the field? The flash won't help because its too far away!<br>
Don't try to use a flash when there is a reflective object<br>
directly in front of the lens. For example, a mirror or<br>
window behind your friends, or the fishtank glass between you and that shark at<br>
SeaWorld. Move off to the side diagonally a little, so that the light, when it flashes off<br>
the reflective object, won't bounce directly back to your lens, but instead will bounce<br>
into empty space beside you!<br>
Use the flash to fill in shadows. If your subject has side-lighting erasing the features on<br>
its face that you want to capture on film, use the flash to erase the shadows. BE SURE<br>
you're far enough away, or the whol picture will be blotted out!<br>
Some ideas for Pathfinders:<br>
Try using a flash when your friends are in a dark cave or room. Arrange them 6 feet<br>
away from your camera, then take 2 pictures. One with a flash and one without.<br>
Notice the difference. Now take one with your friend(s) only 3 feet away. What<br>
happened?<br>
At your next campout, just before sunset grab some friends and have them stand<br>
in front of camp, with the sunlight coming from one side, casting shadows on their<br>
faces. Take 2 pictures. One with fill-in flash, and one without. What was the<br>
difference?<br>

For average owners, the importance of the<br>
breed is in understanding for what purpose<br>
the dog was bred and how that purpose<br>
relates to its life as a pet. Herding dogs<br>
often get a reputation for nipping, because<br>
that is the way they control animals they are<br>
herding. Retrievers require lots of regular<br>
active running and chasing. Lap dogs love to<br>
be in your lap. Dalmatians are coach dogs.<br>
As decorative as they are, if they will not<br>
have an opportunity for regular exercise, you<br>
should choose some other dog. If you like<br>
an active dog, you should get a bigger dog. If you like a more laid-back dog, get a lap<br>
dog.<br>
You can buy a dog from a reputable </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">dog breeder</span><span style="color:#212529;">, if you are motivated to adopt by the<br>
desire for a specific type of dog or if you wish to minimize the uncertainty that often<br>
accompanies a shelter dog. You will also pay significantly more for the privilege, but<br>
welcoming a well-bred, healthy and trained dog into your home is quite a privilege,<br>
indeed! The extra cost is often small compared to the treatment of the symptoms of a<br>
genetic disorder.<br>
Keep in mind that good, reputable breeders do not breed every cycle and may even lose<br>
money when they do have a litter. Costs they assume include<br>
health and genetic testing of the mother,<br>
getting the mother together with a genetically appropriate father who is also tested<br>
for health and genetic problems,<br>
medical care for the mother during pregnancy and birth (including a caesarian if<br>
necessary),<br>
medical and routine care for the puppies (even sick ones) for at least 8-10 weeks,<br>
microchipping of each puppy, and<br>
caring for any puppy that becomes homeless during its lifetime.<br>
Buying a dog from a pet store is not recommended, as these dogs are often poorly<br>
socialized, receive no training, and are commonly weaned from their mothers and<br>
siblings too early (often 5 weeks). You usually don't know where they came from and<br>
how the previous owner treated them. If you ever see a dog in a pet store, and want to<br>
take them home and care for them, consider the following:<br>
Puppies require a great deal of attention and time;<br>
Training is a tedious and occasionally frustrating process;<br>
Puppies normally learn bite inhibition from their mothers and littermates between 5<br>
and 10 weeks of age so you will have to do the teaching;<br>
Pet stores commonly (some would say &quot;always&quot;) stock animals bred in </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">puppy mills<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">or by non-reputable breeders, in unsanitary, dangerous and inhumane conditions --<br>
and every puppy mill dog purchase perpetuates the existence of puppy mills.<br>
Many </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">animal welfare </span><span style="color:#212529;">charities recommend </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">adopting a dog </span><span style="color:#212529;">from an </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">animal shelter</span><span style="color:#212529;">,<br>
rather than buying one at a store or from a breeder. Getting an adult dog from a shelter<br>
avoids surprises in such things as the size and temperament of your pet. They are<br>
often neutered and house-trained, too!<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Registration<br>
There are two ways a dog could be registered. The first of these, for purebred dogs, is<br>
with the dog's breed registry. This type of registration is done once, usually by the dog's<br>
breeder.<br>
The second type of registration applies to all dogs, but perhaps not in all localities<br>
Most local governments require that dogs be licensed. The owner must pay a small fee<br>
and prove that the dog has been vaccinated against the rabies virus. The government<br>
agency may issue tags that the dog is to wear on its collar. Failure to register a dog in<br>
this way when it is required can lead to stiff penalties that far exceed the cost of the<br>
nominal fee and the cost of vaccination.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Shots<br>
As mentioned in part b of this requirement, vaccination against rabies is often<br>
mandated by the local government. Even if it is not mandated, it is still a good idea.<br>
When you acquire a dog, you should get documentation on the shots it has had. Do not<br>
trust the seller in this regard. If the dog does not have documentation, it is very unlikely<br>
that it has had its shots, and you may be required to get them again anyhow. A dog<br>
must be taken to a veterinarian to receive its shots. They will know which shots are<br>
required, and they will provide you with the documentation you need to get your dog<br>
registered.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Describe what can be done to remove fleas, ticks, and lice from your dog.<br>
Prevention<br>
The best course of action is to prevent these parasites from infecting your dog by<br>
treating them with a preventative medicine. One such medicine is <em>Fipronil</em>, the active<br>
ingredient in Frontline. Another is <em>Imidacloprid Permethrin</em>, the active ingredient in K9<br>
Advantix and Vectra 3D. These medicines are applied topically every month and are<br>
available with a veterinarian's prescription. Your dog's vet may advise other measures<br>
as well.<br>
Tick Removal<br>
If you find a tick attached to your dog, find a pair of tweezers and dip them in rubbing<br>
alcohol. Grasp the tick as near the dog's skin as possible and then gently pull. Be<br>
patient and pull firmly and with consistent force. The tick will eventually tire and release<br>
its grip. You can then either place it in a sealable container (such as a freezer bag or a<br>
jar) so that it can be analyzed by a vet, or you can destroy it by dropping it in rubbing<br>
alcohol. Wash your hands when you are finished.<br>
When removing the tick:<br>
Do not squeeze the tick's body - pull it out by grasping it near its jaws.<br>
Do not twist the tick - just pull.<br>
Do not try to &quot;burn the tick out&quot; by applying a lit match to it. This is dangerous! It is<br>
also likely to cause the tick to disgorge bacteria into your dog's bloodstream.<br>
Don't allow your dog to eat the tick (it will likely try).<br>
Flea and Lice Removal<br>
Fleas and lice can be combed out of your dog's hair. If your dog has an infestation you<br>
should give it a bath with flea/lice shampoo, then groom the dog with a fine comb.<br>
Finally, dip the dog in a pyrethrin dip. You will also need to treat any area where your<br>
dog has spent a lot of time (its bed, dog house, etc.) to prevent reinfestation.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Mention some of the diseases, pests, and worms that dogs can get.<br>
Rabies<br>
Rabies is a viral disease commonly associated with dogs, although in recent years<br>
canine rabies has been practically eliminated in North America and Europe due to<br>
extensive and often mandatory vaccination requirements. Rabies in dogs is a fatal<br>
disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mammal, such as a cat, raccoon, bat,<br>
or another dog. Animals with rabies suffer deterioration of the brain and tend to<br>
behave bizarrely and often aggressively, increasing the chances that they will bite<br>
another animal or a person and transmit the disease.<br>
Distemper<br>
Canine distemper, caused by a virus similar to the cause of measles, is a highly<br>
contagious disease that affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central<br>
nervous systems. It is spread through either direct contact with respiratory<br>
excretions, through the air, or on inanimate objects such as clothing. Symptoms<br>
and signs include discharge from the eye or nose, coughing, difficulty breathing,<br>
vomiting, diarrhea, depression, seizures, and paralysis.<br>
Kennel cough<br>
Kennel cough is a highly contagious canine illness characterized by inflammation<br>
of the upper respiratory system. It can be caused by viral infections such as canine<br>
distemper. It is so named because the infection can spread quickly among dogs,<br>
such as in the close quarters of a kennel.<br>
Fleas and Ticks<br>
Fleas and ticks of various species can be acquired and brought home by a dog,<br>
where they can multiply and attack humans (and vice versa). This is particularly<br>
important, now that tick-borne Lyme Disease has become endemic throughout a<br>
large area, in addition to other similar diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted<br>
Fever.<br>
Hookworms, Tapeworms, and Roundworms<br>
Parasites, particularly intestinal worms such as hookworms, tapeworms and<br>
roundworms, can be transmitted in a dog's feces. Some tapeworms have fleas as<br>
intermediate hosts: the worm egg must be consumed by a flea to hatch, then the<br>
infected flea must be ingested (usually by the dog while grooming itself) for the<br>
adult worm to establish itself in the intestines. The worm's eggs then pass through<br>
the intestines and adhere to the nether regions of the dog, and the cycle begins<br>
again.<br>
Heart worms<br>
As the name suggests, an infected mosquito injects a larva into the dog's skin,<br>
where it migrates to the circulatory system and takes up residence in the<br>
pulmonary arteries and heart, growing and reproducing to an alarming degree. The<br>
effects on the dog are quite predictable, cardiac failure over a year or two, leading<br>
to death. Treatment of an infected dog is difficult, involving an attempt to poison<br>
the healthy worm with arsenic compounds without killing the weakened dog, and<br>
frequently does not succeed. Prevention is much the better course, via heartworm<br>
pills which are fed to the dog and contain a compound which kills the larvae<br>
immediately upon infection without harming the dog. Often they are available<br>
combined with other parasite preventives.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Explain what you should do for a dog bite.<br>
This depends on the severity of the bite. If the dog did not puncture the skin, the most<br>
important thing for you to do is correct the dog. For innocent chewing on people's<br>
hands and feet, an effective correction is to spray some bitter apple into the dog's<br>
mouth. This is available at a pet supply store, and quickly teaches the dog that biting<br>
and mouthing are not allowed.<br>
If the skin is punctured but the injury is not severe, you will need to wash out the wound<br>
with soap and water and apply a disinfectant. The often parroted theory that a dog's<br>
mouth is clean and even promotes healing is patently false. Dogs routinely eat feces! It<br>
is therefore imperative that the wound be disinfected. The dog will also need to be<br>
corrected.<br>
If the injury is severe, the victim may need to seek attention from a qualified medical<br>
professional. In serious attacks, the dog may need to be euthanized. If a dog is not<br>
trained properly, it may severely injure or even kill a human. If this happens, the dog will<br>
almost certainly be put down, and the owner may face legal action.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Describe how to housebreak a puppy.<br>
There are two common approaches to housebreaking a puppy: crate training, and paper<br>
training. Both have their proponents and detractors. Both techniques are known to be<br>
effective, but it is best to choose one and stick with it. Switching from one technique to the<br>
other will confuse your dog and lengthen the amount of time required for housebreaking.<br>
Crate Training<br>
By instinct, most dogs do not want to defecate or urinate in their den. The crate is intended to<br>
be a substitute for a den.<br>
A puppy may be kept in a crate except during feeding time or during supervised play time.<br>
When allowed to exit the crate, the puppy is taken to a soiling area to defecate or urinate.<br>
A crate should be large enough for a puppy to be able to stand up, turn around, and lie down<br>
comfortably. If there is too much space, the puppy might use the unoccupied end for wastes.<br>
If an owner doesn't want to buy multiple crates as the puppy grows, it's possible to block off<br>
one end of a larger crate, or to buy a crate with removable dividers.<br>
The puppy's potty breaks must be frequent enough to avoid “accidents” since puppies have a<br>
difficult time controlling urination and defecation. Control gets better as the puppy gets older.<br>
Even an adult dog, when ill or affected by certain medications, can end up soiling the crate,<br>
making the dog uncomfortable both physically and mentally, if the owner isn't vigilant and<br>
aware of the dog's needs.<br>
Toys and soft bedding material in the crate make it more comfortable for a dog or puppy.<br>
A crate should not be used as a prison. Trainers advise that the crate only be closed when the<br>
owner is home. Crate training is not the same as confinement for extended periods. No dog<br>
should ever be confined to a crate beyond its ability to control its bodily functions.<br>
Paper Training<br>
Paper training is easier if the puppy is confined to a small space (i.e. inside a pen). Place a<br>
plastic sheet covered with a layer of newspaper (preferably 3 pages thick) on the bottom of<br>
the pen. Watch your puppy closely. When the puppy goes to the bathroom on the papers,<br>
reward him (preferably with a clicker word and a treat). Clean the dirty papers immediately<br>
(but, if you don't mind this, don't clean the plastic. Your puppy may be encouraged to continue<br>
going on the papers if it smells a little.). Gradually decrease the amount of papers in the cage<br>
until you've gone down to three pages stacked on top of each other.<br>
Bell Training<br>
Bell training is best used if you're training your dog to go to the bathroom outside. First, get a<br>
cow bell, a buzzer with a large, paw or nose-friendly button, or some other noise making<br>
device and teach your dog to use it.<br>
Hang the bell near the door your dog would have to go through to get outside to his bathroom<br>
space. Smear cheese wiz on it. If the bell rings when the dog licks it off, reward him<br>
(preferably with a clicker word and a treat). Next, put the dog outside every time he licks the<br>
cheese wiz off and rings the bell. Reward the dog when he goes outside with the bell, but<br>
reward him even more if he goes to the bathroom after ringing the bell. Continue this until the<br>
dog rings the bell without the cheese wiz.<br>
You can train the dog to push a buzzer button with his paw by placing a treat on the button.<br>
Don't let him get to the treat with his mouth. This will frustrate the dog, causing him to try to<br>
reach the treat with his paw.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Explain in detail how you would wash a dog and care for its general hygiene.<br>
Bathing<br>
Bathing is an important part of the overall grooming process.<br>
Brushing is often recommended before bathing, to remove dead skin and loose hair. Human<br>
shampoos are generally not recommended, due to pH differences between humans and dogs.<br>
Here are some general steps:<br>
Rinse the dog completely.<br>
Apply the shampoo on dog's back. Lather well. Repeat for belly, legs and tail.<br>
Short-haired dogs can be scrubbed in a circular pattern. It may be easier to wash<br>
medium-length haired with a back-and-forth motion; longer-haired dogs in the<br>
direction of hair growth.<br>
A washcloth can be used to wash the dog's sensitive head and face.<br>
Rinse again, holding the water with one hand as you work out the soap with another.<br>
Run your hand all along the dog to remove excess water. Squeeze longer hair to remove<br>
excess water.<br>
Towel-dry. Use a hair dryer on longer haired dogs, but use a very low heat setting because<br>
of the sensitivity of the dog's skin to heat.<br>
Many use an indoor tub for dog bathing. For many home owners this can be burdensome,<br>
especially with large dogs. If you have an outside dog, chances are they may be particularly<br>
more dirty than an inside dog. Getting your large, dirty dog inside can be difficult and messy.<br>
You can always wash your dog outside with a water hose. It is important to be conscious of<br>
the outside temperature and the temperature of your outside faucet water.<br>
It may be useful to purchase an elevated dog bath tub that brings the dog up to the level of the<br>
human, not vice versa. The ability to wash your dog without bending down or getting on your<br>
knees is not only convenient, but less stressfull on your body. Many tubs also have straps to<br>
hold your dog inside the tub and prevent them from slipping and hurting themselves. A simple<br>
search for </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">dog bath tub </span><span style="color:#212529;">will reveal many providers of quality tubs especially for bathing your<br>
dog. They can also substitute for a grooming table.<br>
Hygiene<br>
Other areas of dog hygiene include brushing, cleaning its ears, and trimming its nails.<br>
Brushing<br>
This is especially important for long-haired dogs. Brushing will pick up loose hair from the<br>
dog and reduce shedding problems. Have your dog sit or lie down, and use a dog brush to<br>
gently sweep through its fur. Do not tug at tangles (it hurts!) If you find a heavily matted<br>
area of fur that cannot be brushed out, carefully cut it out with scissors, but be <em>very</em><br>
careful. You do not want to injure your dog, and you do not want to give it a bad haircut<br>
either!<br>
Cleaning the ears<br>
This can be done with a damp paper towel. Again, you get your dog into a sitting position<br>
and begin petting it. Scratch it around the ears, and then gently work the paper towel into<br>
the inner ear, rubbing and massaging the dog as you clean. Do not insert the paper towel<br>
into the ear canal where you will be unable to retrieve it. Throw the soiled paper towel<br>
away and use a new one for the other ear.<br>
Trimming the claws<br>
For this you will need a special nail trimmer made just for trimming the nails of dogs. You<br>
should be able to find one at a pet supply store. Do <em>not </em>use nail trimmers made for human<br>
nails. Carefully examine your dog's nail, looking for the <em>quick</em>. If you trim it too short, you<br>
will cut into the quick, causing much pain for your dog, and causing it to bleed (sometimes<br>
profusely). Trim the front paws first, and then if desired, trim the rear ones as well. Dogs<br>
that spend a lot of time running on pavement or rocks will not need their nails trimmed.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Take full responsibility for feeding and watering a dog for two or three months.<br>
Decide how often you will feed your dog - typically it is done once or twice per day. Be careful<br>
not to overfeed the dog, and do not give it snacks (i.e., human food) between meals. It is best<br>
to fill the dog's bowl at the same time every day - dogs love routines.<br>
Water, on the other hand, should always be available to your dog. Keep an eye on the water<br>
dish and refill it if it is not full (even if it's only half full). You should also keep an &quot;ear&quot; on the<br>
water dish. When you hear your dog drinking, you should refill the dish as soon as it is<br>
convenient to do so - sooner if the dog has just been exercising.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Train your dog until you can successfully demonstrate the following:*<br>
The commands listed here are very similar to the ones listed in the AKC Novice Test, which<br>
has a score of up to 200. The AKC Novice Test also include a &quot;free heel&quot; which is the same as<br>
a regular heel, except without a leash. See </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">http://www.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/LA/DrP9Nov.htm<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">for details.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Heel: Your dog walks close to your left side and sits when you halt.<br>
This can be done by holding a treat in your left hand and letting your dog smell it. Then<br>
start walking and give the command <em>heel</em>. If you allow the dog to nibble at the treat<br>
while you walk, he will follow along just where he is supposed to. Stop and command<br>
the dog to sit. When he complies, give him the rest of the treat.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Figure 8: Your dog stays close to your side without sniffing people, fire<br>
hydrants, or other dogs.<br>
The <em>Figure 8 </em>is an exercise during which the trainer walks in a figure 8 around two<br>
cones while the dog heels. The dog should ignore distractions during the exercise.<br>
During the figure eight, the dog will have to walk around the cone while the trainer<br>
walks on the outside of the first circle. Then the direction changes and the dog will<br>
walk around the cone while the trainer walks along the outside of the second circle.<br>
Once the dog knows how to heel, this exercise can be practiced until the dog (and the<br>
trainer) have learned it.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Stand for examination: Your dog allows strangers to touch him.<br>
Get your dog's attention.<br>
Hold a treat to his nose and let him smell it. Move it behind his head and he will sit.<br>
(This is how you teach <em>sit </em>by the way).<br>
Move the treat away from him and give the command to <em>stand</em>.<br>
Keep moving it away until he is standing.<br>
Give him plenty of praise (and the treat).<br>
Practice.<br>
When the dog seems to know <em>stand</em>, drop the treat on the floor.<br>
Do not allow the dog to get the treat until you release him (by saying &quot;OK!&quot;)<br>
If the dog goes for the treat before the release, take it away. Then give the stand<br>
command again.<br>
In the AKC Novice Test, the &quot;stranger&quot; is the judge.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Recall: Your dog comes when called, sits directly in front of you, and moves<br>
to your left side on command.<br>
For this action, the command is either &quot;front&quot; or &quot;come.&quot; To train a dog to come when<br>
called, get a treat, and get the dog's attention. Tell her &quot;come&quot; or &quot;front,&quot; perhaps even<br>
using her name: &quot;Come, Penny!&quot; When she comes, give her the treat. When the dog<br>
seems to &quot;get&quot; this, have her sit on your left before giving her the treat. You can do this<br>
by getting her to follow her nose for the treat - just move it around until she is next to<br>
you, then move the treat over her head as when teaching &quot;sit&quot;. Do not praise the dog or<br>
give her the treat until she sits, but then give her the treat, and pour on the praise.<br>
Practice until she can do this easily.<br>
Do not use this command anytime you wish to confine the dog or to scold her. If your<br>
dog is misbehaving and you tell her to come - and then you punish her - she will be very<br>
confused. In her doggy mind, she will associate the command with the punishment, as<br>
in &quot;Uh oh! I'm in trouble! I'd better get outta here!&quot; This is exactly the opposite of what<br>
you want.<br>
If the dog is misbehaving, it is OK to tell her to come, but then you must not punish her.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Long sit and long down: Your dog stays in either position while you attend<br>
to other business.<br>
Sit is one of the first (and easiest) commands to teach a dog. Hold a treat in your hand<br>
and get your dog's attention. Hold the treat so that she can see it and smell it, but not<br>
take it. With the dog positioned in front of you, give the command to sit. Then move the<br>
treat over the dog's head (over the ears). If the dog does not sit (which is the natural<br>
reaction), move the treat farther back. When she does sit, say <em>OK! </em>immediately give her<br>
the treat, and heap plenty of praise on her. Practice until the dog knows to sit when you<br>
say <em>sit</em>. The next step is to command the dog to sit, and then - instead of giver her the<br>
treat, place it on the floor out of her reach. If she gets up from the sit position, pop the<br>
leash and give a firm (but not angry) <em>No </em>and remove the treat. Do not let her take the<br>
treat until you say <em>OK! </em>which is the release command. Do not make her wait for more<br>
than five seconds at first, but then practice with longer and longer delays.<br>
Down starts out just like sit. Give the command <em>down </em>and hold the treat over her head<br>
until she sits. Then move the treat between her front paws. Keep pushing it underneath<br>
her chest until she lays down. Then release (say <em>OK!</em>) and giver her the treat. Again,<br>
practice until she has this down. Then instead of giving her the treat, place it out of her<br>
reach, as you did with <em>sit</em>. Do not allow her to get the treat until you give the release.<br>

The Drawing honor was created in 2013 when the NAD Honor Taskforce voted to expand and replace<br>
the Drawing and Painting honor with four new honors: </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Drawing</span><span style="color:#212529;">, </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Drawing - Advanced</span><span style="color:#212529;">, </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Painting</span><span style="color:#212529;">, and<br>

honor, and the new Drawing honor received a new insignia.<br>

be used to minister within your:<br>
a. local church<br>
b. community<br>
A drum corps within the local church can build excitement among the youth and make them<br>
enthusiastic about being in the church. It effectively dispels the &quot;church is not cool&quot; myth.<br>
A drum corps that performs in the community raises the community's awareness of the local<br>
church in a positive way. A drum corps may be the first contact an individual within the<br>
community has had with the church. Though this is unlikely to make a person think &quot;Hey, I<br>
ought to start going to church&quot; and show up the next Sabbath, it will give them a positive<br>
association so that when a subsequent contact is made (such as an invitation to an<br>
evangelistic event or a health seminar), it is more likely to be met with success. Also it helps<br>
marchers stay in step.<br>

Rolls<br>
Single Stroke Roll Rudiments<br>
The single-stroke roll consists of alternating sticking (i.e., RLRL, etc.) of indeterminate speed<br>
and length.<br>
No. Name Notation Description<br>
1.<br>
Single<br>
Stroke<br>
Roll<br>
Evenly-spaced notes played with alternating sticking. Though<br>
usually played fast, even half notes with alternating sticking would<br>
be considered a single stroke roll.<br>
2.<br>
Single<br>
Stroke<br>
Four<br>
Four notes played with alternating sticking, usually as a triplet<br>
followed by a strong beat (as in the picture) or as three grace notes<br>
before a downbeat (like a ruff).<br>
3.<br>
Single<br>
Stroke<br>
Seven<br>
Seven notes played with alternating sticking, usually as sextuplet<br>
followed by a strong beat.<br>
Multiple bounce roll rudiments<br>
No. Name Notation Description<br>
4.<br>
Multiple<br>
Bounce<br>
Roll<br>
Alternating handed strokes with no specific number of bounces.<br>
Should sound even and continuous. Also called &quot;buzz roll.&quot;<br>
5.<br>
Triple<br>
Stroke<br>
Roll<br>
Each stroke can be bounced (a controlled sticking using a<br>
combination of wrist and fingers) or wristed (using only the wrist<br>
for the movement). Also called a &quot;French roll.&quot; Using the<br>
combination of wrist/fingers constitutes what is called the<br>
&quot;Moeller&quot; technique.<br>
Double stroke open roll rudiments<br>
The double stroke roll is a rudiment consisting of alternating diddles (i.e., RR, LL, etc.) of<br>
indeterminate speed and length. There are 10 official variants of the double-stroke roll (see<br>
below).<br>
No. Name Notation Description<br>
6.<br>
Double<br>
Stroke<br>
Open Roll<br>
Like the single-stroke roll, usually played fast, but even when<br>
played slowly, alternating diddles are considered a double stroke<br>
roll. Played so each individual note can be heard distinctly.<br>
7.<br>
Five<br>
Stroke<br>
Roll<br>
Two diddles followed by an accented note.<br>
8.<br>
Six Stroke<br>
Roll<br>
Unlike most other double stroke rudiments, the six stroke roll<br>
begins with an accented single note. Then it is followed by the<br>
diddles and another accented note.<br>

Diddle rudiments<br>
In percussion, a diddle consists of two consecutive notes played by the same hand (either RR<br>
or LL). Compare to the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">drag</span><span style="color:#212529;">, which also consists of two consecutive notes played by the same<br>
hand.<br>
The paradiddle is a rudiment consisting of a four-note pattern of the form RLRR or LRLL. When<br>
multiple paradiddles are played in succession, the first note always alternates between right<br>
and left. There are also several official variations of paradiddle rudiments. Paradiddles are<br>
often used to switch hands while playing steady notes. For example, if steadily playing<br>
sixteenth notes, with right hand lead (RLRL, etc.), then wanting to end on a drum to the left of<br>
the current drum, he may stick it as follows: RLRL RLRL RLRL RLRR L with the final left tap on<br>
the ending drum.<br>
No. Name Notation Description<br>

Single<br>
Paradiddle Two alternating notes followed by a diddle.<br>
17.<br>
Double<br>
Paradiddle Four alternating notes followed by a diddle.<br>
18.<br>
Triple<br>
Paradiddle Six alternating notes followed by a diddle.<br>
19.<br>
ParadiddleDiddle<br>
Two alternating taps followed by two alternating<br>
diddles.<br>
Flam rudiments<br>
A flam is a rudiment consisting of a quiet &quot;grace&quot; note on one hand followed by a louder<br>
&quot;primary&quot; stroke on the opposite hand. The two notes are played almost simultaneously, and<br>
are intended to sound like a single, 'broader' note.<br>
No. Name Notation Description<br>
20. Flam<br>
A single primary note note preceded by a grace note which is<br>
played with the opposite hand. The temporal distance between<br>
the grace note and the primary note can vary depending on the<br>
style and context of the piece being played.<br>
21.<br>
Flam<br>
Accent<br>
Alternating groups of three notes of the form [Flam - tap - tap].<br>
22. Flam Tap Alternating diddles with flams on the first note of each.<br>
23. Flamacue<br>
A group of four notes and an ending downbeat, where the first<br>
note and the down beat are flammed, and the second note is<br>
accented.<br>
24.<br>
Flam<br>
Paradiddle A paradiddle with a flam on the first note.<br>
25.<br>
Single<br>
Flammed<br>
Mill<br>
An inverted paradiddle (RRLR, LLRL) with a flam on the first note<br>
of each diddle.<br>
26.<br>
Flam<br>
Paradiddlediddle<br>
Alternating paradiddle-diddles with flams on the first note of<br>
each.<br>
27. Pataflafla A four-note pattern with flams on the first and last notes.<br>
28.<br>
Swiss<br>
Army<br>
Triplet<br>
A right hand flam followed by a right tap and a left tap, or<br>
(using a left hand lead) a left hand flam followed by a left tap<br>
and a right tap. It is often used in the place of a flam accent,<br>
since repeated flam accents will have three taps on the same<br>
hand in a row, where repeated swiss army triplets only involve<br>
two taps on the same hand.<br>
29.<br>
Inverted<br>

A drag consists of two consecutive notes played by the same<br>
hand (either RR or LL). This is similar to the diddle, except that<br>
by convention diddles are played the same speed as the<br>
context in which they are placed, where drags are played at<br>
twice the speed as the context in which they are placed. For<br>
example, if a sixteenth note passage is being played then any<br>
drags in that passage would by definition be thirty-second<br>
notes, where diddles would be sixteenth notes. Drags can also<br>
be played as grace notes. When played as grace notes on<br>

Continuously playing alternating drags (or diddles) results in a<br>
double-stroke roll.<br>
A similar rudiment is the ruff, which is a note with three grace<br>
notes, but they are usually alternated<br>

one outreach program. (ex. Pathfinder Day, Conference or Local church<br>
sponsored event)<br>
Songs that are marches are written in either 2/4, or more commonly, 4/4 time. When marching<br>
to such a song, the left foot leads and always hits the ground on an odd beat, while the right<br>
foot hits the ground on an even beat. Count the beats in your head as you march, &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 1,<br>
2, 3, 4&quot; etc. The left foot touches the ground on each 1 and 3. The right foot touches on each 2<br>
and 4. If you find you are out of step, a quick hop (where the feet do not cross one another)<br>
can quickly get you back into step. But staying in step is a lot easier than getting back in step<br>
once you're out, so pay attention!<br>
The outreach program will be something like a parade in which your drum corps marches.<br>
This will call for a class A uniform, so make sure it is clean and pressed!<br>

Open, closed, open is a technique of playing snare drum rudiments, especially used during<br>
auditions.<br>
Open, closed, open technique consists of beginning the rudiment very slow and controlled,<br>
speeding up evenly until at the maximum speed for the drummer, then slowing back down<br>
after maintaining that speed. Optimally, the drummer should end on the opposite hand as<br>
started, in case of alternating rudiments such as paradiddles. Also, the speed ended at should<br>
be approximately the same speed as the drummer began.<br>

Demonstrate each style by playing a sequence consisting of no less than three<br>
rudiments.<br>
In the past, snares were typically carried with slings, and due to the discomfort of this angle<br>
for the left hand, traditional grip was created. Most modern snare drums have rigid over-theshoulder harnesses that hold the drum with the playing surface parallel to the ground, which<br>
affords the option of performing with matched grip. The term <em>matched grip </em>is used because<br>
both hands are in the same position (matched). However there are many groups that are<br>
returning to a slight tilt in order to make using traditional grip more comfortable for the<br>
players.<br>

for a percussion drum set?<br>
Snare drum sticks may be designed for use in particular performance contexts. Sticks that are<br>
smaller in diameter or balanced farther towards the tip may be intended for orchestral playing<br>
that requires fine control and soft dynamics. Sticks for street playing (e.g. drum corps and<br>
marching bands) are almost always thick and weighty, to promote extended production of<br>
sound at extreme dynamics. Easy Answer: Drum Corp: Heavy and thick Drum Set: Light and<br>
thin usually with laminated top<br>

There are five primary sections that make up a drum corp/drumline. They are as follows:<br>
Cymbal Section, Snare Line, Tenor Line(including Tri/Quads/Quints), Bass Line, and the Pit.<br>
Note: Some drum corps/drumlines may opt to use a multi-tenor setup instead of having a<br>
single tenor, but they would still fall under the tenor line catergory.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">12 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Based on the previous question, what purpose does each section serve?<br>
Snare Drums<br>
Snare parts are typically unison and provide the center rhythm of the drumline. The snare<br>
drum line is the center of tempo in the ensemble, and the &quot;center snare&quot;, a position typically<br>
held by the most experienced snare drummer, is responsible for maintaining the tempo. When<br>
rehearsing or performing, the center snare may &quot;tap off&quot; the ensemble, setting the tempo with<br>
a solo rhythm.<br>
Tenor Drums<br>
Contemporary tenor drums (also called toms, tri-toms, quads, quints, squints, or sextets) are<br>
single-headed tonal drums. There are usually four to six drums in a set, but there can be as<br>
few as one or as many as seven. Tenor players add pitch variety to the drumline with drums of<br>
different sizes and tuning.<br>
Cymbals<br>
Marching cymbals are typically pairs of crash cymbals played in a variety of ways. Cymbals<br>
are bronze with leather carrying straps. Players in cymbal lines may all carry the same size<br>
and type of cymbal, or a variety of instruments may be used. Cymbals are played being held<br>
before the body, in unison or split parts. In addition to being played by the cymbalists, snare<br>
drummers may play on the cymbals as ride cymbals or like hi-hats, thus there is typically a<br>
minimum of one cymbalist for every two snare drummers. Cymbals are also used for visual<br>
effects due to their reflectiveness while twirling or spinning them. Many contemporary field<br>
ensembles do not utilize a cymbal line, as cymbals are played in the front ensemble.<br>
Bass Drums<br>
Marching bass drums are most frequently used as tonal drums split between several<br>
percussionists. Each drummer plays a unique part, though the entire bass drum part is<br>
conceived as a whole. Marching bass drums, which produce the deepest sound in the battery,<br>
are larger drums carried on harnesses with the heads facing the front and back sidelines. The<br>
musicians carrying the bass drums typically line up in size order. Bass drummers use mallets<br>
with rounded or cylindrical heads often made of hard felt. Small bass drum lines typically<br>
consist of four or five members to ensure enough for a melody, and large lines can have eight<br>

perform, when this happens, sometimes a bass drummer is required to play 2 or 3 bass drum<br>
parts to ensure full sound. In very small bands, one may only see one bass drum witch takes<br>
the place of 3 to 4 bass drums.<br>
Pit<br>
Pit plays all the percussive instruments in the band. The pit usually plays the marimba,<br>
vibraphone, xylophone, chimes, electric keyboard, and bells. They also play the suspended<br>
cymbal and other &quot;auxiliary&quot; instruments such as bongos, tambourine, cowbell, anvil, and bass<br>
drum and gong. The pit usually is the main melody in marching band, especially in drum corp.<br>
The keyboards have a different &quot;utensil&quot; for making sound. They use a mallet which is held the<br>
same way as a drum stick. It is also possible to hold two mallets in each hand, four mallet<br>
technique, and three mallers in each hand, very rare but the six mallet technique. More info<br>
will be provided when the PERCUSSION HONOR is made.<br>

There are different sizes of drum sticks for each situation, designated by a letter and number,<br>
e.g. 2b and 5b are thicker, while 5a and 7a are smaller. The number in the designation<br>
corresponds to the length of the stick, with smaller numbers being longer sticks, and the letter<br>
corresponds to the diameter or gauge of the stick, with the further along the alphabet the<br>
thicker the stick, so &quot;b&quot; is larger than &quot;a&quot;.<br>

preparation for new and old work, paint removal, priming, puttying, finishing, etc.<br>
Preparing the house for repainting, if done properly, almost always takes longer than the<br>
painting itself. It is also the most crucial step in the entire job, as it is the foundation upon<br>
which the rest of the work relies.<br>
Inspection &amp; Repair<br>
Begin by making a careful inspection of the entire house. Look for cracked or rotted boards.<br>
Severely cracked or rotten boards will need to be replaced, and this may require that you get a<br>
building permit (check with local authorities). You cannot simply caulk over rotten wood, as<br>
this does nothing to stop the process of decomposition. Soon after you caulk and paint over<br>
rotted wood, you will find that even more has rotted, and you will have an even bigger job to<br>
do.<br>
Check around the edges of the roof for flashing. All the fascia should be covered with metal<br>
flashing to protect the wood from weather. Doors and windows should also have drip edging<br>
to direct the water away from the openings and to the outside of the house's siding.<br>
Remove any shutters from the house before painting. Shutters can be repaired (if necessary)<br>
and both sides painted while the painter is on ground level (use a drop cloth). They are rehung<br>
after the rest of the house has been painted. This allows the careful painter to paint behind<br>
the shutters. Though that area may not be visible to onlookers, it <em>still </em>requires the protection<br>
from the weather provided by paint, and it cannot be properly painted while the shutters are in<br>
place. The same can be said of the back side of the shutters themselves.<br>
Cleaning<br>
Once repairs have been made, the surfaces to be painted should be thoroughly cleaned. A<br>
pressure washer can do this effectively. Painting over dirt or algae growths is always a bad<br>
idea, as when the dirt flakes away, the paint will go with it and the house will be exposed to the<br>
elements. Do not rely on paint to cover the dirt and expect the paint to hold the dirt in place. It<br>
must be removed.<br>
Ladders and Scaffolding<br>
Scaffolding is superior to ladders for painting because it allows you to work on a larger area<br>
for a long time before you have to move it to another area. However, scaffolding is<br>
considerably more expensive than a couple of ladders, so this option may not be viable for<br>
you.<br>
When setting up a ladder, be sure the feet are on level ground. If placing it on a hillside, place<br>
something <em>solid </em>under the lower foot to raise it up. Test the stability of the ladder before<br>
climbing higher than a step or two.<br>
Most people fall from ladders because they are reaching out too far. Do not make that<br>
mistake, as a fall from a ladder can cause serious injury, or even death. Keep your weight<br>
centered over the ladder, and do not attempt to reach over too far. Getting down and moving<br>
the ladder frequently is far easier than spending a few days in the hospital, and the painting<br>
will get done quicker that way too.<br>
Scraping and Sanding<br>
After the exterior has been cleaned, it is time to begin removing the old paint. Paint that is<br>
well-adhered to the surface need not be removed, but all flaking paint <em>must </em>be. Paint should<br>
be scraped off with a scraper. In places where some paint is scraped off but other paint is<br>
well-adhered, the intersection between painted and unpainted should be sanded to make a<br>
smooth transition. Edges in the paint will cause the paint to drip there.<br>
Caulking<br>
In places where the wood has been lightly cracked, it is appropriate to fill in the cracks with<br>
caulking. Be sure to select a caulk that can be painted (not all of them can be - some repel<br>
paint). Smooth the caulk with a putty knife, allow it to dry, and then sand it down. Also caulk<br>
around windows, doors, electrical entrances, vents, water faucets, etc.<br>
Masking<br>
Apply masking tape to the glass near the edges of the panes. Alternately, you can go back and<br>
scrape paint from the glass after the paint dries, though it is generally better to mask it off in<br>
the first place. Be sure to remove the masking tape when the paint has dried (and before you<br>
take down the ladder or the scaffolding!)<br>
Priming<br>
Bare wood should have a coat of primer before the paint is applied. Primer is applied the<br>
same way paint is, so you can follow the instructions given below.<br>
Painting<br>
After all that has been done, you are finally ready to paint. Maybe. If the temperature is below<br>
10°C , do not begin painting. Also resist the urge if there is rain in the forecast. A light<br>
shower can quickly ruin a paint job. If the wood is damp, do not use oil-based paints, as the<br>
moisture will cause the paint to blister. Buy paint in large containers (20 liter buckets are<br>
preferred) so that you can paint an entire section from one batch of paint (for color<br>
consistency). Paint for the trim (which should be painted last) can be bought in smaller<br>
containers.<br>
Always open the paint container on a surface that will not be marred by a paint circle whose<br>
diameter matches that of the can (formed when paint drips down the sides and meets the<br>
ground). Use a dropcloth if necessary. You don't want to leave little paint circles on the<br>
driveway, porch, sidewalk, or lawn. Place the can in a place where you can easily reach it, but<br>
where you will not accidentally kick it over as you step back to admire your work. Admiration<br>
comes to an abrupt end when the can tips over.<br>
Pry the lid from the can with a common screw driver or with a tool designed for this purpose.<br>
Place the lid next to the can so you are not likely to step on it and track paint everywhere.<br>
Shoe prints look even worse than the paint circles.<br>
If the paint was mechanically shaken at the paint store within a day or so of being opened, all<br>
you will need to do is stir it briefly. If it has been sitting for a while, you will need to stir it more<br>
thoroughly. Failure to properly stir the paint may cause the color to change as the can is used.<br>
Stir the paint frequently while you are painting, as the paint components may separate as it<br>
sits (this is why you should stir it in the first place too).<br>
Color Wheel<br>
Some painters like to punch a hole in the rim of the can so that paint can drip out of the rim<br>
and into the can. This hole will be completely covered by the lid when it is replaced, and can<br>
be made with an awl or with a nail.<br>
When replacing the lid, be sure to wipe all the paint from the rim of the can. Place the lid on<br>
the rim, and then lightly tap around the edges to seal it. If the rim was insufficiently cleaned,<br>
paint will splatter all over the place, so it is important to do that job carefully.<br>
If using a brush, dip the tip of the brush into the paint no more than a third the length of the<br>
bristles. Wipe the paint from one side of the brush onto the inner side of the can's rim. Then<br>
raise it to the surface to be painted and brush it on with a smooth horizontal motion.<br>
Don't completely empty the brush before refilling it with paint. It takes a lot longer to paint a<br>
house with a brush that is empty most of the time.<br>

from a paint shop in making the display).<br>
Before you go to the paint store, it might be a good<br>
idea to review color schemes. For this, we turn to<br>
the color wheel, which shows all the colors of the<br>
rainbow cycling from red, to yellow, to blue, and<br>
cycling back to red again. These are the <em>primary</em><br>
                                                      <em>colors </em>and all the other colors in the wheel can be<br>
formed by mixing them together. If equal amounts<br>
of primary colors are mixed, we get a secondary<br>
color: red and yellow make orange, yellow and blue<br>
make green, and blue and red make violet.<br>
Mixing a secondary color with an adjacent primary<br>
forms a tertiary color. For example, blue mixed with<br>
green makes blue-green.<br>
Black and white are not considered colors, though they do affect the way colors look. Mixing<br>
white with a color produces a tint. Mixing black with a color produces a shade.<br>
Many types of color schemes have been devised for all sorts of purposes, but we will focus<br>
on three:<br>
Monochromatic<br>
Complementary<br>
Analogous<br>
From these three recipes, you can easily make ten color schemes (just choose a couple of<br>
different &quot;base&quot; colors for each until you have ten).<br>
Monochromatic Complementary Analogous<br>
Monochromatic<br>
In this scheme, only one color is used, but various tints and shades are combined, such as<br>
blue, light blue, and dark blue. The painter may also use various tints, such as light blue, lighter<br>
blue, and a blue still lighter than that.<br>
Complementary<br>
Complementary colors are colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, such as<br>
blue and orange, red and green, purple and yellow.<br>
The high contrast between the colors creates a vibrant look, especially when used at full<br>
saturation. Complementary colors can be tricky to use in large doses.<br>
Analogous<br>
Also called harmonious colors, are colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.<br>
Some examples are green, light green, and yellow or red, orange and yellow. Analogous color<br>
schemes are often found in nature and are pleasing to the eye.<br>

All rust and flaking paint should be removed before applying new paint. Heavy flakes can be<br>
removed with a wire brush, or with a wire brush attachment for an electric drill. Once the<br>
heavy flakes and rust have been removed, go over the surface with sandpaper.<br>
Next, determine what type of solvent is used for cleaning the paint. This will depend on the<br>
type of paint chosen, and could be turpentine, mineral spirits, paint thinner, or some other<br>
solvent. Dampen a clean rag with the solvent and clean the metal with it. Once the solvent<br>
dries, the surface is ready for primer. You may use either one or two coats of primer. Follow<br>
the directions on the can to determine the amount of time needed between coats. The time<br>
between coats of primer may differ from the time between the final coat of primer and the<br>
first coat of paint.<br>

Mineral Spirits<br>
Mineral Spirits is a petroleum distillate commonly used as a paint thinner and mild solvent.<br>
Outside of the United States and Canada, it is referred to as white spirit. Painters use mineral<br>
spirits as an alternative to turpentine, one that is both less flammable and less toxic. Because<br>
of interactions with pigments, painters require a higher grade of mineral spirits than many<br>
industrial users, including the complete absence of residual sulphur.<br>
It is used as a degreasing solvent and as a solvent in aerosols, paints, wood preservatives,<br>
lacquers, varnishes, and asphalt products. In western Europe about 60% of the total mineral<br>
spirits consumption is used in paints, lacquers and varnishes. Mineral spirits is the most<br>
widely used solvent in the paint industry. In households, white spirit is commonly used to<br>
clean paint brushes after decorating. Its paint thinning properties enable brushes to be<br>
properly cleaned (by preventing the paint from hardening and ruining the bristles) and<br>
therefore enabling them to be re-used.<br>
Turpentine<br>
Turpentine (also called spirit of turpentine, oil of turpentine, wood turpentine, gum turpentine)<br>
is a fluid obtained by the distillation of resin obtained from trees, mainly pine trees. As a<br>
solvent, turpentine is used for thinning oil-based paints and for producing varnishes.<br>
Mineral Turpentine<br>
Mineral turpentine, also known as turpentine substitute, turps substitute, or just turps is an<br>
inexpensive petroleum-based replacement for the vegetable-based turpentine. It is commonly<br>
used as a paint thinner for thinning oil-based paint and cleaning brushes, and as an organic<br>
solvent in other applications.<br>
Acetone<br>
Acetone can be used for thinning and cleaning fiberglass resins and epoxies. It is a strong<br>
solvent for most plastics and synthetic fibers, so it should not be used when it could come<br>
into contact with these materials.<br>
It is ideal for thinning fiberglass resin, cleaning fiberglass tools and dissolving two-part<br>
epoxies and superglue before hardening. A heavy-duty degreaser, it is useful in the preparation<br>
of metal prior to painting; it also thins polyester resins, vinyl and adhesives. It easily removes<br>
residues from glass and porcelain.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Show ability to properly use brush, roller, and spray equipment in outside work.<br>
Brush<br>
Load the brush directly from the paint container as described previously. Be sure to force<br>
some paint between clapboards with the brush. Wipe the paint onto the surface, and then<br>
brush it out with two to four strokes. Latex should not be overbrushed, as this will leave brush<br>
marks in the finished surface. Reload the brush with paint as soon as the paint begins to<br>
lighten. It takes much longer to paint a surface with an empty brush than with a full one.<br>
You should be able to tell whether you need to use horizontal or vertical strokes by<br>
considering the surface you are working on. On clapboards or horizontal siding, work the<br>
brush from side to side. Shingles should be painted with vertical strokes.<br>
Roller<br>
A roller should not be used on siding or clapboards. It should be reserved for flat surfaces<br>
such as masonry walls. Pour some paint from the container into the roller tray, filling it so that<br>
the paint covers about half the ramp. Place the roller at the top of the ramp, and roll it into the<br>
reservoir. At the end of the reservoir, lift the roller and carry it back to the top of the ramp.<br>
Then roll it down again. If you roll it back up, you will succeed in wetting the part of the roller<br>
that is already wet, and no paint will be loaded into the dry portion of the roller.<br>
Then roll the paint onto the wall with broad up-and-down strokes. First you will apply the paint,<br>
then roll it out to a smooth finish. You can paint the edges and corners with a brush if<br>
necessary. When the roller is empty, reload it. An extension handle is a handy time saver that<br>
will allow you to paint a large vertical section of the wall.<br>
Sprayer<br>
Before using any spray equipment, carefully read <em>and follow </em>the instructions. Sprayers<br>
invariably cover more area than anticipated by the novice, so be careful to mask off a very<br>
large area adjacent to the surface to be painted. Use tarps and drop cloths for this, covering<br>
grass, shrubbery, and concrete. Move cars away from the house before starting. Mask <em>all </em>the<br>
glass on windows, not just the parts near the muntins and mullions (i.e., the pane separators).<br>
Cover roof shingles too.<br>
Spray the paint on using several thin coats, allowing the paint to dry between each application.<br>
Houses are big, so you should be able to move on to another area while the coat dries. If you<br>
spray it on too thick, it will drip and look quite unprofessional. Clean spray equipment<br>
thoroughly when finished.<br>

group project for a special-needs person in the church or community).<br>
Ask your pastor if he knows of a person whose house needs to be painted. Because he makes<br>
regular visits to members in need, he should be aware of anyone who could use your<br>
assistance.<br>
You will be supplying the labor for free, but the primer, paint, tape, and caulk may need to be<br>
purchased. There are several options available for this:<br>
Ask the manager of a paint store to sponsor your project.<br>
Ask your church board for money to cover the cost of materials.<br>
Hold a fundraiser so you will have money to buy materials.<br>
Ask the person whose house you are painting to pay for the materials.<br>

discount on the paint (or provide it free of charge). You could hold a fundraiser to cover part or<br>
all of the rest, or the church board could cover it, or the person who benefits could. There may<br>
also be other ways to pay for the materials too - use your imagination!<br>
Be sure to do a good job. Be careful not to slop paint all over the shrubbery, windows,<br>
driveway, etc. People will be watching to see what kind of job you do - especially those who<br>
helped pay for the materials. Don't let them down.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Explain and demonstrate how to prepare and finish new or old woodwork in the<br>
following ways:<br>
a. Staining<br>
b. Varnishing<br>
c. Painting<br>
The key to a good finish is surface preparation. Whether you are staining, varnishing, or<br>
painting, the surface must be clean. How it is cleaned depends more on the suface being<br>
finished than on the method used to finish it.<br>
Do not paint over dirt, cobwebs, or loose paint. For drywall, start by vacuuming all the<br>
cobwebs and dust. Then use a household cleaner and wash the walls down. Allow them to<br>
dry. Scrape off any loose paint. If it does not all come off, sand the zone between where it did<br>
come off and where it would not to eliminate any ridges (these ridges will become much more<br>
apparent after painting).<br>
In kitchens, the cleaning is especially important, as surfaces will have been coated with<br>
grease. This must be removed, or the lifetime of the paint job will be severely curtailed.<br>
In bathrooms, check for mildew. If any is found, it must be killed with a solution consisting of<br>
one part bleach, three parts water. Mildew is a living thing. If you simply wash it off and paint<br>
over it, it is sure to come back. Be careful to not get any bleach on your clothing, as it will<br>
cause it to discolor. Once you have wiped the bleach solution on the wall (or sprayed it on),<br>
allow it to sit for 15 minutes to do its work. Then rinse it off with clean water.<br>
The next thing to do is address any defects in the walls. Do not assume that the paint will<br>
cover them. Paint is more likely to amplify imperfections than it is to cover them. Cover any<br>
holes with spackling compound, using a putty knife or a taping knife. Reseat any nail pops,<br>
setting them below the surface (one final blow with the hammer will put a small dent in the<br>
wall - this is actually desired). Then fill the hole with joint compound and wipe it off with a<br>
taping knife.<br>
Larger imperfections should be re-enforced and covered with drywall tape and a layer of joint<br>
compound. Work the joint compound with a taping knife until it is as smooth as you can make<br>
it. Allow it to dry, then sand it. If necessary, add a second layer of joint compound. Allow it to<br>
dry and sand it.<br>
For bare wood, sand out any imperfections and glue down any splits or nail pops. Sand over<br>
any glued areas once the glue dries (stain and varnish will show you exactly where there is<br>
glue instead of wood, and you do not want this to happen). Wipe the wood down with a cloth<br>
dampened with whatever solvent is used for cleaning the finish (that is, if the finish is cleaned<br>
out of the brushes with turpentine, wipe the wood down with turpentine). Consult the product<br>
information on the can of finish to determine the proper solvent.<br>
Wood that has already been stained can be prepared by rubbing down with steel wool,<br>
followed by a cloth dampened with the proper solvent (see above).<br>
Give two methods of stippling.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">When you stipple, a glaze coat of one color is applied and then textured, revealing the<br>
undercoat of a base color. In both cases, a glaze is mixed with latex paint at a 5:1 ratio (five<br>
parts glaze, one part paint). Stippling should be done in small sections moving from the top of<br>
the wall to the bottom so that if there are drips or runs, it will not ruin the work already<br>
completed.<br>
With either method begin as follows:<br>
Prepare the surface as you would for any interior painting project, repairing cracks, taping<br>
baseboards, removing outlet and light switch covers, etc.<br>
Paint the surface a light color for the undercoating.<br>
Allow the base color to dry completely.<br>
Mix the paint and glaze.<br>
Brush Stippling<br>
Using a sponge, wet a small section of the wall. This will allow the glaze to go on fluidly.<br>
Paint the glaze onto the dampened surface with a regular paint brush. Work the brush top<br>
to bottom, then side to side, then top to bottom again, making criss-crosses.<br>
Stipple the wet glaze by jabbing the bottom of a stippling brush's bristles onto the surface<br>
head-on. The brush should be perpendicular to the wall. Continually alter the pattern.<br>
Go over the surface once quickly, and then go back over it again to refine the pattern.<br>
Sponge Stippling<br>
Select a natural sea sponge and cut it in half to form a flat surface.<br>
Prepare the wall and paint the base color as with brush stippling (described above).<br>
Dip the sponge in a bucket of water and then wring it dry.<br>
Press the sponge lightly into a tray full of paint.<br>
Blot the sponge on a paper towel to remove excess paint.<br>
Lightly dab the sponge on the wall, making J or X patterns.<br>
Overlap the patterns as you move from side to side and top to bottom.<br>
Dip the sponge in water and wring it out again occasionally.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3 </span><span style="color:#212529;">When should a paint spray gun be used?<br>
A paint spray gun should be used when painting highly textured surfaces. Examples of<br>
textured surfaces include stucco, cinder blocks, and rough-hewn lumber. These are very<br>
difficult (but not impossible) to paint with a roller or a brush.<br>
Paint sprayers are much faster than rollers and brushes, and they are not limited to textured<br>
surfaces. If you can protect areas that are <em>not </em>to be painted, a sprayer can be used in almost<br>
any area. Avoid using near furnaces, ovens, and water heaters though unless you are able to<br>
extinguish (or prevent) open flames. Gas water heaters, gas ovens, gas furnaces, propane<br>
furnaces, and oil furnaces all have open flames. Remember that if the paint is flammable, so<br>
are the fumes.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Describe the proper methods for cleaning and care of paint and varnish brushes.<br>
Proper cleaning starts <em>before </em>you begin to paint. If using a water-soluble paint, dip the brush in<br>
water. If using a paint (or varnish) that is not water-soluble, dip the brush in whatever solvent<br>
is called for. Then shake the brush to remove excess water (or solvent). Once this is done, you<br>
are ready to dip the brush in the paint for the first time.<br>
When you are finished painting, run water over the outside of the brush, letting it flow away<br>
from the brush's ferrule and off the tip of the bristles. Then fill an empty, clean paint can (or<br>
bucket) halfway with water and add a couple tablespoons of dish washing liquid. Swirl the<br>
brush around in the soapy water, but do not jab the bristles into the bottom of the can. This<br>
will cause the bristles to develop permanent bends.<br>
Color Wheel<br>
Rinse the brush in a second can (or bucket) of clear water. If the rinse water clouds up, return<br>
to the soapy water, and then rinse again. Repeat until the rinse water does not cloud up. Hang<br>
the brush to dry by the hole drilled in the tip of its handle.<br>

Putty is used to fill nail holes an blemishes in door and wind facings, baseboards, and crown<br>
moldings. It should have the consistency of paste. Tear off a small ball of putty and push it<br>
into the hole with your finger. Then, still using your finger, wipe it away, so that some is left in<br>
the hole, but the top is even with the surface of the wood. Allow the putty to dry before<br>
painting.<br>

Paint is made for interior or exterior use, and they are made to have different characteristics.<br>
Interior paint characteristics Exterior paint characteristics<br>
Good scrubbing and stain resistance Color retention/fade resistance<br>
Ability to hide/cover (whatever is being<br>
painted over)<br>
Flexible (expands or contracts with weather<br>
changes)<br>

swatches from a paint shop. Why are bright/loud colors not preferred?<br>
Bright colors make it difficult to relax in a room, so they should be avoided in most interior<br>
spaces.<br>
Before you go to the paint store, it might be a good<br>
idea to review color schemes. For this, we turn to<br>
the color wheel, which shows all the colors of the<br>
rainbow cycling from red, to yellow, to blue, and<br>
cycling back to red again. These are the <em>primary</em><br>
                                                      <em>colors </em>and all the other colors in the wheel can be<br>
formed by mixing them together. If equal amounts<br>
of primary colors are mixed, we get a secondary<br>
color: red and yellow make orange, yellow and blue<br>
make green, and blue and red make violet.<br>
Mixing a secondary color with an adjacent primary<br>
forms a tertiary color. For example, blue mixed with<br>
green makes blue-green.<br>
Black and white are not considered colors, though they do affect the way colors look. Mixing<br>
white with a color produces a tint. Mixing black with a color produces a shade.<br>
Many types of color schemes have been devised for all sorts of purposes, but we will focus<br>
on three:<br>
Monochromatic<br>
Complementary<br>
Analogous<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">[1]<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">From these three recipes, you can easily make ten color schemes (just choose a couple of<br>
different &quot;base&quot; colors for each until you have ten).<br>
Monochromatic Complementary Analogous<br>
Monochromatic<br>
In this scheme, only one color is used, but various tints and shades are combined, such as<br>
blue, light blue, and dark blue. The painter may also use various tints, such as light blue, lighter<br>
blue, and a blue still lighter than that.<br>
Complementary<br>
Complementary colors are colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, such as<br>
blue and orange, red and green, purple and yellow.<br>
The high contrast between the colors creates a vibrant look, especially when used at full<br>
saturation. Complementary colors can be tricky to use in large doses.<br>
Analogous<br>
Also called harmonious colors, are colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.<br>
Some examples are green, light green, and yellow or red, orange and yellow. Analogous color<br>
schemes are often found in nature and are pleasing to the eye.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Oil based<br>
Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended<br>
in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the<br>
addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to<br>
increase the glossiness of the dried film.<br>
Oil-based paints are the better choice for high-traffic areas, for metal surfaces, or for<br>
surfaces that will be exposed to low temperatures. Oil-based paints also resist staining<br>
better than water-based paints.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Water based<br>
Latex paint is a water-borne dispersion of sub-micrometre polymer particles. The term<br>
&quot;latex&quot; in the context of paint simply means an aqueous dispersion; latex rubber (the<br>
sap of the rubber tree that has historically been called latex) is not an ingredient. These<br>
dispersions are prepared by emulsion polymerization. Latex paints cure by a process<br>
called coalescence where first the water, and then the trace, or coalescing, solvent,<br>
evaporate and draw together and soften the latex binder particles and fuse them<br>
together into irreversibly bound networked structures, so that the paint will not<br>
redissolve in the solvent/water that originally carried it.<br>
Water-based paints are best for any areas not suited to oil-based paints. They resist<br>
fading better and are easier to apply. Clean up is also much easier, and the odor during<br>
application is far lower than with oil-based paints.<br>

The woodwork includes the baseboards, door frames, window frames, and crown molding.<br>
This requirement suggests that the woodwork be painted a different color than the walls. It<br>
could also have a natural finish (such as varnish).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">10 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Paint at least one room, showing skill in keeping paint where it belongs.<br>
Paint belongs on the walls and ceilings. It does not belong on the floor, windows, outlet and<br>
switch covers, door knobs, latches, or hinges. Nor does it belong on light fixtures, smoke<br>
detectors, sprinklers, art work, mirrors, telephones, appliances, or furniture.<br>
If the woodwork is to have a finish distinct from the walls, paint does not belong there either.<br>
How do we keep paint where it belongs?<br>
Lay down a drop cloth.<br>
Tape the baseboards, windows, hinges.<br>
Remove door knobs and switch and outlet covers.<br>
Move furniture out of the room, or cover it with a drop cloth.<br>
Remove or tape light fixtures.<br>
Do not paint over smoke detectors - tape them off, and remove the tape when you are<br>
finished.<br>
Rather than taping, professional painters usually use a technique called &quot;cutting in.&quot; With this<br>
technique, an angled brush is used, and it is kept mostly dry. It doesn't take much paint to<br>
cover trim. Put no more than an inch or two of paint in a bucket that has no lip. Grip the brush<br>
by the bristles as if you were holding a pencil. Treat the handle as if it were there only to hold<br>
the bristles together, not as something you hold the brush by.<br>
Dip the brush no more than half in inch into the paint, then drag it dry along the wall of the<br>
bucket to remove the excess paint. Then paint a line. The outer bristles form the sharp edge<br>
of the line. Practice on the wall before you move in to the critical areas.<br>
But sometimes in spite of our best efforts, paint <em>does </em>go where it does not belong. When that<br>
happens don't panic - just clean off the unwanted paint.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">11 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Tell and show how to properly store unused paint.<br>
The key to storing unused paint is to prevent air from reaching it. This is done by properly<br>
sealing the can. Store paint where is will not freeze.<br>
Proper storage begins before you open the can. Open the can with a <em>key </em>- a special tool made<br>
just for opening paint cans. Most paint stores will give you one when you buy paint. If not, you<br>
can buy one - they're not expensive (or stores wouldn't be giving them away). Prying the lid off<br>
with a screwdriver will distort the lip making it impossible to achieve a tight seal.<br>
Once the can is open, do not wipe a wet brush on the lip of the paint can. This forms a <em>chime</em><br>
which makes it difficult to seal the can properly. Use a plastic pouring cap to pour the paint<br>
into a tray or into a small bucket. If you do get paint on the can's lip, wipe it off with a cloth<br>
before sealing it.<br>
Place the lid on the can and tap it closed with a rubber mallet.<br>

Soil Ingredients<br>
Different potting soil ingredients impart different properties to the soil. We list several<br>
ingredients here along with their characteristics:<br>
Clay<br>
Clay is soil that sticks together into a ball when compressed. It is impermeable to water,<br>
so it inhibits drainage. It is very common in garden soil and is typically avoided as a<br>
potting soil ingredient.<br>
Silt<br>
Silt is soil or rock derived granular material of a specific grain size. Silt may occur as a soil<br>
or alternatively as suspended sediment in a water column of any surface water body. It<br>
may also exist as deposition soil at the bottom of a water body.<br>
Sand<br>
Sand is made up of mineral grains larger than those that make up silt. Water will pass<br>
through sand, so it is useful in creating well-drained soils.<br>
Perlite<br>
Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content. It makes<br>
composts more open to air, while still having good water-retention properties. It can<br>
therefore hold water in the soil until it is needed by a plant.<br>
Vermiculite<br>
Vermiculite is a natural mineral that expands with the application of heat. It is very similar<br>
to perlite and has many of the same properties.<br>
Peat<br>
Peat is soft and easily compressed. Under pressure, water in the peat is forced out. It is<br>
also dug into soil to increase the soil's capacity to retain moisture and add nutrients.<br>
Humus<br>
Humus refers to any organic matter which has reached a point of stability, where it will<br>
break down no further and might, if conditions do not change, remain essentially as it is<br>
for centuries, if not millennia. It is often the basis for potting soils.<br>
Compost<br>
Also known as brown manure, compost is the aerobically decomposed remnants of<br>
organic matter. Compost serves as a growing medium,or a porous, absorbent material<br>
that holds moisture and soluble minerals, providing the support and nutrients in which<br>
most plants will flourish. To maximize plant growth, it is sometimes necessary to dilute<br>
compost with soil or peat to reduce salinity or to add neutralisers to bring the pH closer to<br>
7, or additional nutrients like fertilisers or manure, wetting agents, and materials to<br>
improve drainage and aeration, such as sand, grit, bark chips, vermiculite, perlite, or clay<br>
granules.<br>
Manure<br>
Manure is organic matter used as fertilizer. Manures contribute to the fertility of the soil by<br>
adding organic matter and nutrients, such as nitrogen that is trapped by bacteria in the<br>
soil. Manure is generally acidic, lowering the soil's pH. It is often combined with lime to<br>
bring the pH back to a neutral level.<br>
Pea gravel/crushed stone<br>
These are often layered at the bottom of a pot to promote drainage. Crushed stone will<br>
also raise the pH of the soil making is less acidic.<br>
Fertilizer<br>
Inorganic fertilizers are described by three numbers (such as 10-20-20) which specify the<br>
amount of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) they contain. These are<br>
essential plant nutrients.<br>
Lime<br>
Lime is used for raising the pH of soil. Combined with manure, the horticulturalist can set<br>
the soil's pH level to a plant's optimum level.<br>
Bonemeal<br>
Bone meal is a mixture of crushed and coarsely ground bones that is used as an organic<br>
fertilizer. As a slow-release fertilizer, bone meal is primarily used as a source of<br>
phosphorus.<br>
Blood meal<br>
Blood meal is dried, powdered animal blood used as a high-nitrogen fertilizer. It is one of<br>
the highest non-synthetic sources of nitrogen and if over-applied it can burn plants with<br>
excessive ammonia. Blood meal is completely soluble and can be mixed with water to be<br>
used as a liquid fertilizer.<br>
Pine bark<br>
Shredded bark will make soil hold more water.<br>

to grow them? Grow two or more African violets. Indicate whether they are boy or<br>
girl type violets.<br>
African Violets do best when the available light is about 1000 foot candles, though unless you<br>
have access ot a light meter, this information is not terribly useful. Instead, you should learn<br>
how to tell if the plant is getting too much or too little light by observing its leaves. If they<br>
receive too much light, the leaves will turn pale or yellowish green. If they are not receiving<br>
enough, the leaves will turn a deep, dark shade of green. African Violets need fairly bright light,<br>
but should not be placed in direct sunlight. Rather, they need diffuse, indirect light. If you place<br>
your hand between the plant and its light source, your hand should cast a shadow, but it<br>
should not feel too hot. This light level can typically be attained by placing the plant about one<br>
meter from a southeast- or west-facing window.<br>
Furthermore, they will not bloom unless they have at least eight hours darkness every day, so<br>
if you are growing them under lights, make sure the lights are on a timer.<br>
All gesneriads need approximately the same growing conditions. Where do they<br>

need?<br>
Saintpaulia, commonly known as African violet, is a genus of 6 species of herbaceous<br>
perennial flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae, native to Tanzania and adjacent<br>
southeastern Kenya in eastern tropical Africa, with a concentration of species in the Nguru<br>
mountains of Tanzania.<br>
African violets prefer a constant temperature between 20-25 °C (68-77 °F) with high humidity,<br>
and thrive best planted in well-drained humus or coir compost. We sometimes think of the<br>
tropics as very HOT and HUMID places, but under the tall trees of a true tropical environment,<br>
the temperature is rather moderate and comfortable, though the amount of moisture in the air<br>
is higher than in many places in the western U.S.<br>
In practical houseplanting terms, this means that African violets and other gesnariads (jes<br>
nair' e ad OR guess nair' e ad) are comfortable in the same temperatures and moisture levels<br>
that human beings are UNLESS the African violet is placed near an air conditioning vent,<br>
where the cold dry air will cause it to perish.<br>

divisions. Raise one plant from two of these methods and keep it growing at least<br>
six months.<br>
Cuttings<br>
Leaf cuttings<br>
Any plant with leaves such as African Violet, Geranium etc. can be propagated with leaf<br>
cuttings. Using a sharp knife, cut off a healthy leaf at the point where it joins the stem.<br>
Insert the cut part, called a petiole, into the rooting hormone. Place the end into a small<br>
container of light potting soil in which you make a small hole with a pencil. Making a hole<br>
prior to planting assures that the rooting hormone will not be brushed off the cutting when<br>
you plant it. Perlite, Vermiculite, and/or water-soaked Sphagnum moss can be added to<br>
potting soil to make the soil light. Make sure the leaf is leaning slightly so that the new<br>
plants will have plenty of light and not be shaded by the leaf.<br>
Stem cuttings<br>
These are treated just like leaf cuttings except you cut off a stem with several leaves<br>
instead of just one leaf. Remove the bottom leaves, leaving a few at the top. Proceed as<br>
with the leaf cutting.<br>
In both instances, cover the pot with a plastic bag or inverted glass jar. This will keep moisture<br>
from evaporating and keep the cutting from wilting. Keep in a warm location with diffused<br>
light but out of direct sunlight. When there is indications of growth after about 3 to 6 weeks,<br>
transplant the new emerging plant into a new pot of potting soil. Continue to keep a humid<br>
environment for about 2 more weeks until active growth begins.<br>
Layering<br>
Layering is a means of plant propagation in which a portion of an aerial stem grow roots while<br>
still attached to the parent plant and then detaches as an independent plant.<br>
Natural layering typically occurs when a branch touches the ground, whereupon it produces<br>
adventitious roots. At a later stage the connection with the parent plant is severed and a new<br>
plant is produced as a result.<br>
The horticultural layering process typically involves wounding the target region to expose the<br>
inner stem and optionally applying rooting compounds. In ground layering, the stem is bent<br>
down and the target region buried in the soil. This is done in plant nurseries in imitation of<br>
natural layering by many plants such as brambles which bow over and touch the tip on the<br>
ground, at which point it grows roots and, when separated, can continue as a separate plant.<br>
In either case, the rooting process may take from several weeks to a year.<br>
Layering is more complicated than taking cuttings, but has the advantage that the propagated<br>
portion can continue to receive water and nutrients from the parent plant while it is forming<br>
roots. This is important for plants that form roots slowly, or for propagating large pieces.<br>
Offsets<br>
Offsets are layers of plants in the plant nursery business. They are clones of the mother<br>
plants (&quot;hens and chicks&quot;), meaning that they have the same genetic code.<br>
Offsets form when meristem regions of plants, such as axillary buds or homologous<br>
structures enlarge, and differentiate into a new plant with self-sustaining structures. Tulips<br>
and lilies are examples which display offset characteristics.<br>
When propagating plants to increase a stock of a cultivar, thus seeking identical copies of<br>
parent plant, various cloning techniques (asexual reproduction) are used. Offsets is a natural<br>
means by which plants may be cloned.<br>
In contrast, when propagating plants to create new cultivars, sexual reproduction through<br>
pollination is used to create seeds. The recombination of genes gives rise to offspring plant<br>
with similar but distinct offspring genome.<br>
Division<br>
Division is a method of asexual plant propagation, where the plant (usually an herbaceous<br>
perennial) is broken up into two or more parts. Both the root and crown of each part is kept<br>
intact. The technique is of ancient origin, and has long been used to propagate bulbs such as<br>
garlic and saffron.<br>
To divide a plant, wait until late summer when the plant has quit producing flowers and has<br>
died back. Dig up the bulbs and break them apart as you would a clove of garlic (which is a<br>
bulb). Replant the bulbs wherever you want them (some perhaps in the very spot where you<br>
dug them up, others elsewhere).<br>

Bonsai is the art of aesthetic miniaturization of trees by growing<br>
them in containers. Cultivation includes techniques for shaping,<br>
watering, and repotting in various styles of containers. The word<br>
                                                      <em>bonsai </em>has been used in the West as an umbrella term for all<br>
miniature trees.<br>

Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. The term &quot;humidity&quot; is usually taken in daily<br>
language to refer to relative humidity. Relative humidity is defined as the amount of water<br>
vapor in a sample of air compared to the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at<br>
any specific temperature in a form of 0 to 100%.<br>
Humidity, along with temperature, moisture, light, soil mixture, fertilizers, potting, and pest<br>
control, is one of the critical factors that should be considered when caring for a houseplant.<br>
Humidity is slightly more difficult to control than temperature. The more commonly used<br>
houseplants have established that they can survive in low humidity environments as long as<br>
their roots are kept properly irrigated. Most plants thrive in 80% relative humidity while most<br>
homes are usually kept around 20% to 60% relative humidity. Besides buying a humidifier,<br>
there are a few things that can be done to increase humidity around houseplants. The most<br>
popular methods used to raise the ambient humidity are misting and pebble trays, which are<br>
shallow trays covered with pebbles and filled with water that evaporates to increase humidity.<br>
Other methods of raising humidity include grouping plants closely together and not placing<br>
plants in drafty areas. Misting is somewhat controversial among gardeners, with some that<br>
swear by it and others that say it does little to increase humidity around plants.<br>

A vast collection of many independent, inter-connected computer networks that use<br>
the TCP/IP protocols and that developed from ARPANet of the late '60s and early '70s.<br>
&quot;The Net,&quot; is a worldwide system of computer networks providing reliable and<br>
redundant connectivity between disparate computers and systems by using common<br>
transport and data protocols.<br>

Though <em>World Wide Web </em>(or simply Web for short) is a term frequently used<br>
(incorrectly) when referring to &quot;The Internet&quot;, it has two major meanings: First, loosely<br>
used: the whole constellation of resources that can be accessed using Gopher, FTP,<br>
HTTP, telnet, USENET, WAIS and some other tools. Second, the universe of hypertext<br>
servers (HTTP servers), more commonly called &quot;web servers&quot;, which are the servers<br>
that serve web pages to web browsers.<br>

A site on the World Wide Web where any number of computer users can type in<br>
messages to each other (chat) in real time, creating an online conversation. These<br>
messages usually appear on an area of the screen next to the user’s nickname or<br>
handle (your online nickname or the name you go by in a chat room). Most chat rooms<br>
have a particular topic (which you are expected to discuss) but there are some that are<br>
purely for meeting other people. Beginning in the 2003, chat rooms began to give way<br>
to social media platforms such as MySpace, then later Facebook, Twitter Instagram,<br>
Snapchat, and Tiktok.<br>

To move a digital file (such as a media file) from a local system to a server where it is<br>
t d f th t l t t i l F l b t b<br>
stored for others to access or later retrieval. For example, web pages must be<br>
&quot;uploaded&quot; to a web server for them to be viewed on the World Wide Web. The<br>
terminology for &quot;upload&quot; and &quot;download&quot; comes from the days of satellite<br>
communications. When an earth-bound terminal send data to the remote computer<br>
(the satellite), it was uploaded, as the direction of data travel was up. When the<br>
terminal received data from the satellite, it was downloaded, as the directin of data<br>
travel was down.<br>

One or more files (pages) stored on a computer (a &quot;server&quot;) that can be accessed via<br>
the Internet. Every website has a &quot;home page&quot;, which is generally designed as the file<br>
visitors first see when coming to the site and which gives an idea of the site's contents.<br>
All files on a website usually contain textual or graphical &quot;links&quot; that can be clicked<br>
using an input device such as a mouse to move to other files, either within the site or<br>
on another one.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1g </span><span style="color:#212529;">Email<br>
Email is similar to personal letters, only a lot faster. Email is used to send messages via<br>
your computer to friends and acquaintances around the world. Requires a computer,<br>
email software, an email account through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and a<br>
modem. Technically, email (electronic mail) is the exchange of computer-stored<br>
messages by telecommunication. Most email messages usually contain text, but you<br>
can also send non-text files, such as graphic images and sound files as attachments.<br>
Email accounts for a large percentage of the total traffic over the Internet. An email<br>
address is easily identified by the '@' symbol, for instance<br>
webmaster@pathfindersonline.org, making identification of the domain it's attached to<br>
much easier - in this case pathfindersonline.org<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1h </span><span style="color:#212529;">Virus<br>
Throughout this honor, the term “virus” represents the traditional virus, as well as<br>
trojans, worms, and other malicious code.<br>
Traditional virus<br>
In computer security technology, a virus is a self-replicating program that spreads<br>
by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. Thus, a<br>
computer virus behaves in a way similar to a biological virus, which spreads by<br>
inserting itself into living cells. Extending the analogy, the insertion of the virus into<br>
a program is termed infection, and the infected file (or executable code that is not<br>
part of a file) is called a host.<br>
Trojan<br>
named after the Trojan horse used by the rescuers of Helen of Troy. A Trojan is a<br>
computer program that disguises itself as a useful software application that is<br>
actually used to gain access to your computer.<br>
Worm<br>
A computer worm is a self-replicating computer program. It uses a network to send<br>
copies of itself to other nodes (computers on the network) and it may do so without<br>
any user intervention. This is due to the poor security the computers infected have.<br>
Unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Worms<br>
almost always cause at least some harm to the network, if only by consuming<br>
bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted<br>
computer.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Webmail / POP3 / IMAP mail<br>
All are methods / techniques for reading email.<br>
Webmail<br>
Webmail is a web application that allows users to read and write e-mail using a web<br>
browser. Examples: Gmail is the most common webmail in use today. Hotmail.com,<br>
yahoo.com and many other online services offer you the option to view your email<br>
from their website. This is &quot;webmail.&quot;<br>
POP3 mail<br>
Post Office Protocol 3. A protocol that provides a simple, standardized way for<br>
users to access mailboxes and download messages to their computers. Examples:<br>
Outlook Express, Outlook, Eudora, Mozilla Thunderbird*<br>
IMAP<br>
Internet Message Access Protocol'. IMAP is a method of distributing e-mail. It is<br>
different from the standard POP3 method in that with IMAP, e-mail messages are<br>
stored on the server, while in POP3, the messages are transferred to the client's<br>
computer when they are read. Thus, using IMAP allows you to access your e-mail<br>
from more than one machine, while POP3 does not. This is important because<br>
some email servers only work with some protocols. Example: AOL is an IMAP mail<br>
provider, though they also offer webmail services.*<br>

A program used to view, download, upload, surf or otherwise access documents<br>
(pages) on the World Wide Web. Browsers can be text-based meaning they do not<br>
show graphics or images but most however are text and graphical based. Browsers<br>
read &quot;marked up&quot; or coded pages (usually HTML but not always) that reside on servers<br>
and interpret the coding into what we see &quot;rendered&quot; as a Web page. Examples:<br>
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari are<br>
examples of Web browsers.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2c </span><span style="color:#212529;">IRC/IM (Instant Messenger) client<br>
Internet Relay Chat. A live chat area of the Internet in which real-time conversations<br>
among two or more people take place via special software. Each specific IRC channel<br>
begins with a # and is dedicated to a different area of interest. IRC is considered<br>
another part of the technology of the Internet the same way FTP, Telnet and the Web<br>
are.<br>
An instant messenger is a client which allows instant text communication between two<br>
or more people through a network such as the Internet.<br>
Examples include Windows Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ client, Yahoo<br>
Messenger, and Jabber, as well as software programs that allow you to talk to friends<br>
on multiple “messenger” platforms simultaneously.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Streaming Media<br>
Video or audio transmitted over a network that users can begin to play immediately<br>
instead of waiting for the entire file to download. Typically a few seconds of data is<br>
sent ahead and buffered in case of network transmission delays. (Although some data<br>
is buffered to the hard drive, it is written to temporary storage and is gone once viewing<br>
is complete.) RealMedia, QuickTime and Windows Media are the most common<br>
streaming formats.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Search Engine &amp; Search Directories<br>
Internet search engines (e.g. Google, Bing) help users find web pages on a given<br>
subject. The search engines maintain databases of web sites and use programs (often<br>
referred to as &quot;spiders&quot; or &quot;bots&quot;) to collect information, which is then indexed by the<br>
search engine. Similar services are provided by &quot;directories,&quot; which maintain ordered<br>
lists of websites, e.g. Yahoo!<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2f </span><span style="color:#212529;">Antivirus software<br>
A computer program designed to detect and respond to malicious software, such as<br>
viruses and worms. Responses may include blocking user access to infected files,<br>
cleaning infected files or systems, or informing the user that an infected program was<br>
detected. Such tools should be included as part of the computing systems<br>
environment that the web services are delivered from. Examples include Norton<br>
Antivirus, McAfee Antivirus, Trendmicro Antivirus. Online FREE antivirus tools includes<br>
Trendmicro's Housecall, and freea-v.com .<br>
Note<br>
Many of these companies also offer &quot;Internet Security Suites&quot; that assist the user in<br>
also blocking and removing trojans, worms, malware, and other malicious code.<br>

A system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.<br>
Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of<br>
both. Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from<br>
accessing private networks connected to the Internet, especially intranets. All<br>
messages entering or leaving the intranet pass through the firewall, which examines<br>
each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.<br>
Examples include: ZoneAlarm, Microsoft Firewall, Norton Firewall, and many other free<br>
and for-pay packages.<br>

computer files safe?<br>
The authors of virus and anti-virus programs are in a continual game of cat-and-mouse.<br>
Virus authors are constantly figuring out new ways to get around anti-virus programs,<br>
and anti-virus programs are continually updated to thwart the new viruses. The most<br>
successful virus programs are the ones most recently developed. If you do not keep<br>
your anti-virus software program up-to-date, your computer is vulnerable to the newest<br>
viruses.<br>

friends?<br>
We might share a file to our friends or family through an email or device without<br>
knowing that the file contains virus. The virus might damage our friend's or family's<br>
computer or even thumb drive that we use to share files that might contain virus.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4d </span><span style="color:#212529;">What harm can a virus do to your computer or to other people’s computers?<br>
Viruses can damage your files in the computer including software. The damaged<br>
software contains a copy of the virus, and can then spread to other computers. Many<br>
viruses will consume computing power on the host, bogging it down and making it<br>
unresponsive. They can attempt to infect other machines over the network, consuming<br>
the network's bandwidth and slowing down the Internet connection for all other users<br>
in the building (even computers that are not infected).<br>
g ( p )<br>
Many viruses completely take over the computer they infect and can be remotely<br>
controlled by the attacker. These attackers can then use the computer to send spam, or<br>
mount a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against their target's web server or<br>
computer network. Sometimes these viruses record keystrokes on the infected<br>
computer so that they can capture usernames, passwords, and bank account numbers.<br>
This information can then be forwarded to the attacker who can either use the<br>
information or sell it to someone else.<br>

that the Pathfinder open the three web pages in separate tabs in the browser. A tab can<br>
be opened usually by right-clicking on the link and selecting the &quot;Open page in another<br>
tab&quot; option. In Firefox, clicking the link with the center mouse button (or using both the<br>
left and right buttons at the same time) will open the page in a new tab. Once three<br>
tabs have been opened, the instructor can check that the requirement has been met onscreen, without printing anything.<br>

1. Do not reply to unknown emails or Spam. You’re simply verifying that yours is a<br>
“real” email address and you will immediately receive even more junk email.<br>
2. Do not open emails with attachments unless you are SURE that they’re okay, and<br>
that your antivirus program is fully updated (most are auto-updated these days).<br>
3. Report any material sent to you in email that is unsafe or that you feel breaks God’s<br>
laws.<br>
4. Never respond to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; directions in a spam or UCE (unwanted<br>
commercial email) message.<br>
5. Keep your computers operating system patches up to date. If you're using<br>
Windows, do this from the MS Windows Update site using the Windows Update<br>
function.<br>

These abbreviations are a form of shorthand used to describe knitting patterns. Though the<br>
requirement is to <em>define </em>them, it is also prudent to <em>learn how to do them </em>as well. Indeed, the<br>
rest of this honor will not be possible without at least learning the knit (K) and purl (P)<br>
stitches.<br>

K is the abbreviation for the Knit stitch. The knit stitch is the basic stitch used in<br>
knitting. It can be combined with the purl stitch (see below) to form interesting<br>
patterns.<br>

P is the abbreviation for the Purl stitch. A purl stitch is the backwards version of a knit<br>
stitch. A row of purl stitches would look just like a row of knit stitches when viewed<br>
from the opposite side.<br>

RND is the abbreviation for <em>round</em>. A round is a row of stitches, either going all the way<br>
across the work (when it is knitted in the flat), or going all the way around a tube (when<br>
it is knitted in the round).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1e </span><span style="color:#212529;">TOG<br>
TOG is the abbreviation for knit Together. It is a method for reducing the number of<br>
stitches in a row. See the section below on DECcreasing.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1f </span><span style="color:#212529;">PSSO<br>
PSSO is the abbreviation for Pass Slipped Stitch Over. This is a method of decreasing<br>
the number of stitches. See the section below on DECcreasing.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1g </span><span style="color:#212529;">INC<br>
INC is the abbreviation for Increase or Increasing. In knitting, an increase is the<br>
creation of one or more new stitches, which may be done by various methods with<br>
distinctive looks.<br>
Methods of Increasing<br>
Yarn-over increase or &quot;eyelet increase&quot; -- The simplest increase is to do a yarn-over<br>
between two existing stitches. On subsequent rows, the yarn-over will be knitted,<br>
making a new stitch. This disadvantage of this method is that a small hole (eyelet)<br>
is produced at the yarn-over. This can be improved by twisting the yarn-over stitch -<br>
similar to a &quot;make one&quot; (below).<br>
Raised Increase -- Lift the strand connecting two knitted stitches in the row below<br>
onto the left needle (effectively producing a yarn-over) and knit it, either normally or<br>
twisted. This method (especially if twisted) leaves almost no hole, since forming<br>
the yarn-over stitch from the (presumably tight) connecting strand draws the two<br>
neighboring stitches together.<br>
Bar increase -- Knit the stitch normally but without transferring the knitted stitch to<br>
the right needle; the same stitch is then knitted through the back loop. (Knitting<br>
through the front loop again is not feasible, since it would undo the first stitch.)<br>
This increase makes a bar or a nub on the fabric.<br>
Moss increase -- Knit the stitch normally but without transferring the knitted stitch<br>
to the right needle; the same stitch is then purled. This increase makes a bar or<br>
nub on the fabric.<br>
Lifted Increase -- For a right-side increase, knit into the right leg of the stitch of the<br>
row below the next stitch to be knit, then knit the next stitch. For a left-side<br>
increase, knit one stitch, then knit into the left leg of the stitch of the row below it.<br>
This kind of increase can be visually subtle.<br>
&quot;Make One&quot; (M1) -- Place a half-hitch loop on the needle between two stitches,<br>
either before or after, and twisted either left or right, depending on desired effect.<br>
Column of Increases -- A second strand of yarn or roving is passed up the piece.<br>
The second strand is used to make an extra stitch in each row by knitting a<br>
doubled stitch up from the lower row. The resulting piece has one more stitch in<br>
each row and each row is in the shape of an inverted V. The column of increases is<br>
used to make square sweater yokes.<br>
Finally, a large number of increases in a row is best done by casting on; examples<br>
include buttonholes, etc.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1h </span><span style="color:#212529;">DEC<br>
DEC is the abbreviation for Decrease or Decreasing. A decrease in knitting is a<br>
reduction in the number of stitches, usually accomplished by suspending the stitch to<br>
be decreased from another existing stitch or by knitting it together with another stitch.<br>
Methods of Decreasing<br>
When more than one stitch is suspended from a stitch, they can hang in different<br>
orders. For example, the first stitch could be on top of the second stitch (when seen<br>
from the right side) or the reverse, leaning to the left or the right. The order of stitches<br>
is important, both for appearance and for the way it pulls the fabric.<br>
K2tog (&quot;knit two together&quot;) -- Work to the two stitches to be decreased, insert the<br>
right-hand needle into the first two stitches as if to knit, wrap yarn around needle in<br>
normal manner, slip the two stitches off together and drop them. This creates a<br>
right-leaning decrease.<br>
SSK (&quot;slip, slip, knit&quot;) -- Work to the two stitches to be decreased, slip two stitches<br>
one at a time to the right-hand needle, as if to knit; insert the left-hand needle into<br>
the two stitches from front to back, knit the two stitches together and drop them.<br>
This creates a left-leaning decrease.<br>
S1, K1, PSSO (&quot;slip one, knit one, pass slipped stitch over&quot;) -- This results in a<br>
similar look to the SSK but can appear less tidy. Work to the two stitches to be<br>
decreased, slip next stitch to the right-hand needle as if to knit, knit next stitch,<br>
pass slipped stitch over knit stitch. Also creates a left-leaning decrease.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1i </span><span style="color:#212529;">YO<br>
YO is the abbreviation for Yarn Over. In knitting, a yarn over is technique in which the<br>
yarn is passed over the right-hand knitting needle. In general, the new loop is knitted on<br>
the next row, either by itself (producing a hole) or together with an adjacent stitch (e.g.,<br>
in &quot;tucked&quot; slip stitches). The yarn-over may also be dropped on the next row, producing<br>
a longer stretch of yarn between the stitches of the previous row. Conversely, the effect<br>
of a yarn-over can be obtained by picking up the yarn between stitches of the previous<br>
row; the difference is that the yarn then is shorter, and the flanking stitches of the<br>
previous row may be overly drawn together.<br>
The term &quot;yarn-over&quot; refers only to the act of wrapping the yarn around the needle, and<br>
not to the working of the next existing stitch. Yarn-overs are often used to increase the<br>
number of stitches, since knitting a yarn-over creates a new stitch where none existed<br>
previously, but does not use up a stitch on the needle. Yarn-overs are also common in<br>
eyelet and lace knitting, since they produce stable holes in the fabric.<br>
There are several types of yarn-over, depending on how many times the yarn is wrapped<br>
around the knitting needle and on the direction (chirality) with which the yarn is<br>
wrapped. Normally, the yarn is wrapped with a right-handed chirality, i.e.,<br>
counterclockwise when looking at the right-hand needle point-on. Wrapping the yarn<br>
the other way (i.e., left-handedly) will result in a plaited stitch if the stitch is knit on the<br>
following row.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Demonstrate the following:<br>

The single cast on is probably the easiest to learn, but its a little more difficult to knit<br>
evenly with this cast on. The knitted cast on is a little more difficult to learn, but very<br>
similar to the knit stitch, and is a little easier to knit evenly from.<br>
Instructional videos of how to do these cast-ons can be found here:<br>

The basic knit and basic purl bind offs (or cast-offs) are the simplest and easiest to<br>
learn. Be aware that they do create an edge that is not as stretchy as other bind-offs<br>
might.<br>

Cable knitting is a style of knitting in which the order of stitches is permuted.<br>
For example, let there be four stitches on the needle in the order ABCD. The first two<br>
may be crossed in front of the next two, forming the order CDAB.<br>
Cables<br>
Two types of cable needles<br>
1x1 Ribbing<br>
To do this, knit until you come to the stitches<br>
(ABCD) to be cabled. Assuming we are<br>
approaching ABCD from the right, we would<br>
arrive at stitch D first. Slip D &amp; C onto the<br>
cabling needle, and store them either to the<br>
front of the work or behind (which one<br>
depends on whether you want the left to<br>
cross the right or the right to cross the left).<br>
Then knit stitches B and A onto the right<br>
needle. At this point you can slip C &amp; D back<br>
onto the left needle and then knit them onto<br>
the right, or you can knit them straight off<br>
the cabling needle onto the right needle.<br>
Some knitters prefer to transfer the stitches<br>
to a large safety pin or, for a single stitch,<br>
simply hold it in their fingers while knitting<br>
the other stitch(es). Cable stitches are<br>
generally permuted only on the right side,<br>
i.e., every other row. Having a spacer row<br>
helps the fabric to &quot;relax&quot;.<br>
Cable knitting is usually less flexible and<br>
more dense than typical knitting, having a<br>
much more narrow gauge. This narrow<br>
gauge should be considered when changing from the cable stitch to another type of<br>
knitted fabric. If the number of stitches is not reduced, the second knitted fabric may<br>
flare out or pucker, due to its larger gauge. Thus, ribbed cuffs on an aran sweater may<br>
not contract around the wrist or waist, as would normally be expected. Conversely,<br>
stitches may need to be added to maintain the gauge when changing from another<br>
knitted fabric such as stocking to a cable pattern.<br>
Cables are usually done in stocking stitch, with a reverse stocking background, but any<br>
combination will do; for example, a background seed stitch in the regions bounded by<br>
cables often looks striking. Another visually intriguing effect is meta-cabling, where the<br>
cable itself is made up of cables, such as a three-cable plait made of strands that are<br>
themselves 2-cable plaits. In such cases, the &quot;inner&quot; cables sometimes go their<br>
separate ways, forming beautiful, complex patterns such as the branches of a tree.<br>
Another interesting effect is to have one cable &quot;pierce&quot; another cable, rather than<br>
having it pass over or under the other.<br>
Two cables should cross each other completely in a single row; for example, two<br>
cables three stitches wide should cross with the three stitches of one cable passing<br>
over the three of the other cable. It is very difficult to make an intermediate crossing<br>
row of fewer stitches look good.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Ribbing<br>
In knitting, ribbing is a pattern in which<br>
vertical stripes of stockinette stitch<br>
alternate with vertical stripes of reverse<br>
stockinette stitch. These two types of<br>
stripes may be separated by other stripes in<br>
which knit and purl stitches alternate<br>
vertically; such plissé stripes add width and<br>
depth to ribbing but not more elasticity.<br>
The number of knit and purl stripes (wales)<br>
are generally equal, although they need not<br>
be. When they are equal, the fabric has no<br>
Garter stitch<br>
Stockinette stitch<br>
tendency to curl, unlike stockinette stitch. Such ribbing looks the same on both sides<br>
and is useful for garments such as scarves.<br>
Ribbing is notated by (number of knit stitches) x (number of purl stitches). Thus, 1x1<br>
ribbing has one knit stitch, followed by one purl stitch, followed by one knit stitch, and<br>
so on.<br>
Ribbing has a strong tendency to contract laterally, forming small pleats in which the<br>
purl stitches recede and the knit stitches come forward. Thus, ribbing is often used for<br>
cuffs, sweater hems and, more generally, any edge that should be form-fitting. The<br>
elasticity depends on the number of knit/purl transitions; 1x1 ribbing is more elastic<br>
than 2x2 ribbing, etc. However, some cable patterns may &quot;pull in&quot; more than ribbing<br>
(i.e., have a smaller gauge); in such cases, a ribbed border may flare out instead of<br>
contracting.<br>
Slip stitches may be added to increase the depth of the ribbing, and to accentuate the<br>
stitches of certain wales. For example, the knit stitches can be slipped every other row<br>
to double their height and make them come forward.<br>
Ribs can be decorated with nearly any motif used for a plain knitted fabric, e.g.,<br>
bobbles, cables, lace, various colors, and so on.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Garter stitch<br>
Garter stitch is the most basic form of<br>
welting (as seen from the right side). In the<br>
round, garter stitch is produced by knitting<br>
and purling alternate rows. By contrast, in<br>
the flat, garter stitch is produced by knitting<br>
every stitch (or purling every stitch, though<br>
this is much less common).<br>
In garter-stitch fabrics, the &quot;purl&quot; rows stand<br>
out from the &quot;knit&quot; rows, which provides the<br>
basis for shadow knitting. Garter-stitch fabric has significant lengthwise elasticity and<br>
little tendency to curl, due to the symmetry of its faces.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2f </span><span style="color:#212529;">Stockinette stitch<br>
Stockinette stitch (in the UK, Stocking<br>
Stitch) is the most basic knitted fabric; every<br>
stitch (as seen from the right side) is a knit<br>
stitch. In the round, stockinette stitch is<br>
produced by knitting every stitch; by<br>
contrast, in the flat, stockinette stitch is<br>
produced by knitting and purling alternate<br>
rows.<br>
Stockinette-stitch fabric is very smooth and<br>
each column (&quot;wale&quot;) resembles a stacked<br>
set of &quot;V&quot;'s. It has a strong tendency to curl<br>
horizontally and vertically because of the<br>
asymmetry of its faces.<br>
Reverse stockinette stitch is produced in the same way as stockinette, except that the<br>
purl stitches are done on the right side and the knit stitches on the wrong side. In the<br>
round, reverse stockinette stitch is produced by purling every stitch.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2g </span><span style="color:#212529;">Pick up a dropped stitch<br>
It is easiest to pick up a dropped stitch by using a crochet hook. In this case, the<br>
dropped stitch was a knitted stitch (not a purled stitch). For a purled stitch, the crochet<br>
hook would be inserted from the back of the loop instead of through the front.<br>
This photo shows the<br>
dropped stitch.<br>
Notice that right in<br>
the middle of the<br>
picture is a loop that<br>
has lost the yarn that<br>
is supposed to go<br>
through it. The yarn<br>
that has pulled out of<br>
this loop is lying<br>
behind the loop itself.<br>
If picking up a knitted<br>
stitch, insert the<br>
crochet hook through<br>
the front of the loop.<br>
If picking up a purled<br>
stitch, insert the hook<br>
through the loop from<br>
the back.<br>
Catch the dropped<br>
stitch with the<br>
crochet hook.<br>
Pull the dropped<br>
stitch through the<br>
loop with the crochet<br>
hook. You might need<br>
to twist the hook so<br>
that it will more easily<br>
pass through the first<br>
loop.<br>
The dropped stitch<br>
has now been pulled<br>
through the loop<br>
forming a new loop.<br>
In this picture, the<br>
crochet hook has<br>
been thrust through<br>
the newly formed<br>
loop so that it won't<br>
be dropped again by<br>
accident.<br>
Finally, transfer the<br>
new loop (that is, the<br>
formerly dropped<br>
stitch) from the<br>
crochet hook to the<br>
knitting needle. In this<br>
photo, it was<br>
transferred to the<br>
right needle, but it<br>
should have been<br>
transferred to the left<br>
one instead.<br>

Wool is sensitive to agitation and hot water, which causes the overlapping scales of the<br>
fiber to stick together, what we call shrinking, or, if we do it on purpose, felting.<br>
To avoid this, wools should be washed in lukewarm water with little agitation. Most<br>
people prefer to wash wool items by hand to avoid any possibility of felting when they<br>

Yarn can (and is) spun from the hair of many animals, including rabbits (angora) and<br>
dogs (chiengora). The Native Americans that lived in the Northwest portion of the<br>
United States bred dogs so that their hair could be spun into yarn and used in making<br>
exceptionally warm garments.<br>
Garments made from hair should only be washed if they are soiled. Wash in warm<br>
water with a mild liquid detergent (such as dish detergent) or shampoo. It should not<br>
be agitated. Fill a basin, turn off the water, and then add the garment to the basin. Care<br>
must be taken that water is not sprayed on the garment. Excess water should be<br>
squeezed out, and the garment can then be rolled in a towel. Lay it flat to dry, and <em>never</em><br>
put it in a dryer.<br>

Synthetics are well-suited for the many currently popular novelty yarns, and their range<br>
is vast. Manufacturers continually attempt to make synthetic yarns that mimic the best<br>
properties of the natural fibers. Synthetics are generally durable, water-resistant, and<br>
strong, but can also be somewhat non-breathable and non-insulating. Most are<br>
machine washable, but are very sensitive to heat, and they will melt or burn at fairly low<br>
temperatures. Nevertheless, knitters can’t help but be drawn to their seductive textures<br>
and rich colors.<br>
Polyester: Polyester is made from a group of condensation polymers. It is resilient,<br>
smooth, crisp, and springy. It can be shaped with heat and is insensitive to moisture. It<br>
is lightweight, strong, and resistant to creasing, shrinking, and stretching. It is nicely<br>
washable, and is not damaged by sunlight, weather, moths, or mildew. Polyester is very<br>
often combined with other fibers.<br>
Acrylic: Acrylic is a synthetic polymer fabric or yarn, and is lightweight and warm with a<br>
very wool-like feel. Although it is resistant to moths, oils, and chemicals, it is prone to<br>
static and pilling. 100% acrylic yarns can be a bit “cheap-looking,” if not chosen with<br>
care.<br>
Nylon: Nylon was the first completely synthetic fiber. It is strong and resistant to many<br>
chemicals and moths. It is also easy to wash and is very non-absorbent. It can be a bit<br>
scratchy if not blended with another fiber.<br>
Viscose / Rayon: Viscose is a man-made fiber made of wood or cotton cellulose<br>
treated with sodium hydroxide to make a liquid that can be extruded as cellophane or<br>
rayon yarn. Rayon fiber is quite absorbent, dyes very well, is soft, and has a nice drape.<br>
Although it may shrink, it does not melt at high temperatures, and it is resistant to<br>
moths, bleach, and many common household chemicals. Rayon thread is divisible,<br>
shiny, and good for blending, but is not hard wearing.<br>

A new ball of yarn is attached to the working yarn with a simple overhand knot. This knot<br>
serves to hold the new yarn in place until a length of it has been knitted into the fabric. The<br>
end of both the old yarn and the new yarn are then trimmed and woven in.<br>

Worsted Weight (also called Afghan or Aran) yarn is a medium weight yarn that is used<br>
for a wide range of projects. Thick adult sized clothing (such as sweaters, gloves,<br>
scarves, etc.) and home items (such as pillows, afghans, blankets, dishcloths, etc.)are<br>
customarily made from worsted weight yarn. Worsted weight is used when items<br>
should be relatively durable, and thick, but not bulky. Needle sizes 7-9 are<br>
recommended for use with worsted weight yarn, with a gauge of 4-5 stitches per inch<br>
in stockinette stitch.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Sports<br>
Sport weight (also called heavy baby weight, or fine) yarn is used to create objects with<br>
a little more weight than sock yarn, but lighter weight than DK yarn. Baby clothing, light<br>
mittens, and light blankets are examples of items usually knit from sport weight yarn.<br>
The recommended needle size for sport weight yarn is 1-3, with a gauge of 7-8 stitches<br>
per inch in stockinette stitch.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Heavy<br>
Chunky also called craft, or rug weight) is a heavy/bulky weight yarn (not to be<br>
confused with Bulky, or Roving, which is a super bulky weight yarn). It is a thick yarn<br>
that works up quickly on large needles, so if you don't have hours to spend on a new<br>
scarf, this is a good choice for something thick and warm, but also fast. It can also be<br>
used to make a quick throw or blanket.<br>
Needle size: US 9 - 11 (5.5mm - 8mm)<br>
A simple Overhand Knot<br>
Use: one of the most fundamental knots and forms the basis of many others including the<br>
simple noose, overhand loop, angler's loop, reef knot, fisherman's knot and water knot. The<br>
overhand knot is very secure, and can jam badly, so only use if you want a permanent knot. It<br>
is often used to prevent the end of a rope or string from unraveling.<br>
Hook size: US K10 1/3 - M13 (6.5mm - 9mm)<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">5d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Super Bulky<br>
Bulky or Roving, is a super bulky weight yarn used for extremely thick, very quickly<br>
knitted objects, such as very heavy hats, coats and scarves. It is recommended that<br>
objects knitted in roving are done with needles sized 11 or greater, with a standard<br>
gauge of 1.5 - 2 stitches per inch.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Knit two items from the following:<br>
a. Slippers<br>
b. Mittens<br>

Scarf<br>
A scarf is perhaps the simplest knitting project possible. If super bulky yarn is used with<br>
12mm needles, the scarf can be knitted quickly which helps to abate any patience problems<br>
your Pathfinders might have.<br>
Start by casting on 12 stitches.<br>
Knit every row (forming a garter stitch) until the scarf's length exceeds the knitter's<br>
patience.<br>
Bind off.<br>
Reasonable choices<br>
Here are some reasonable choices you might consider:<br>
Socks<br>
There are plenty of free patterns for socks at </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">http://ravelry.com </span><span style="color:#212529;">and<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">http://www.lionbrand.com<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">Leg warmers<br>
Leg warmers are nothing more than open tubes. This would be a good project for cabling.<br>
Draft blocker<br>
A draft blocker is placed on the floor by a door to prevent drafts. It is a sealed tube filled<br>
with some heavy stuffing material (such as florist's pebbles).<br>
Seat cover<br>
A seat cover can be used to provide a softer seat on a hard chair.<br>
Pot holder<br>
A pot holder is nothing more than a square upon which hot pots may be placed. Be sure to<br>
choose a yarn that will not melt (wool or cotton, not acrylic). Do not use a stockinette<br>
stitch, as this will cause the finished product to curl unacceptably. Rather, use a garter<br>
stitch or ribbing.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Plumb line<br>
A plumb line is a string with a plumb bob at the end of it.<br>
The plumb bob hangs straight down, so the plumb line can<br>
be used to make sure that a wall is perfectly vertical and<br>
does not lean in any direction. A perfectly vertical line is<br>
said to be <em>plumb</em>.<br>

A line stretcher is used for guiding the mason when laying brick or other materials in a<br>
straight line. Typically, the mason will build up the corners or ends of a wall first, stretch<br>

Trowel<br>
a line between them, and lay the remaining bricks between them. The line stretcher is<br>
often set about a sixteenth of an inch away from the wall so that the bricks do not<br>
touch it (otherwise they might push the line out).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Level<br>
A spirit level or bubble level is an instrument designed to<br>
indicate whether a surface is level or plumb. Spirit levels<br>
feature a slightly curved glass tube which is incompletely<br>
filled with a liquid, usually colored 'spirit' (a synonym for<br>
ethanol), leaving a bubble in the tube. Ethanol is used<br>
because of its low freezing point, </span><span style="color:#212529;">−</span><span style="color:#212529;">114°C, which prevents<br>
it from freezing in cold weather. Most commonly spirit<br>
levels are employed to indicate how horizontal (level) or<br>
how vertical (plumb) a surface is.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Trowel<br>
A trowel is used for applying mortar to bricks, blocks, or<br>
other material. It is also used for &quot;throwing a mortar line&quot; -<br>
that is, laying a line of mortar atop the surface upon which<br>
that the bricks will be laid.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2e </span><span style="color:#212529;">S-tool<br>
An S-Tool is more commonly known as a jointer. The purpose of the S-tool is to place<br>
the grooves in the mortar between bricks. The concave grooves seen within the mortar<br>
lines of bricks are placed there by scraping the S-tool along the mortar well before it<br>
sets.<br>
The S-tool should be used sometime between the time that the mortar is placed, and<br>
when it begins to harden. If the S-tool is used too late, then it will result in uneven lines<br>
throughout the mortar. The mortar will not have a smooth concave surface, and will<br>
look very raggedy.<br>
Sometimes an S-tool is not used, and the mortar is placed on in excess; the slapping of<br>
the bricks causes it to drip down over the bricks, and it has a very nice effect when the<br>
bricks are painted afterwards.<br>

A Mason's hammer has one flat traditional face and a short or long chisel-shaped<br>
blade. It can thus be used to chip off edges or small pieces of stone without using a<br>
separate chisel. The chisel blade can also be used to rapidly cut bricks or cinder<br>
blocks.<br>

prevent sweating, cracking, shrinking, crumbling, and loss of strength).<br>
Properly mixing and curing concrete will address most of the problems listed here. Adding too<br>
much water to concrete will cause it to lose strength. Ideally, you should only add enough<br>
water to the dry ingredients to make them all slightly wet. It is sometimes necessary to add<br>
more water than this so that the concrete can be poured into a form, and in these cases, only<br>
enough water to get the concrete to flow should be added.<br>
Once the concrete is wet, it will begin to cure. It must be kept moist while it cures, and this can<br>
be accomplished by slowing the evaporation of the water that was mixed into it. Usually, this<br>
is done by covering the concrete with plastic sheeting or by spraying it lightly with water as it<br>
cures.<br>
Concrete will shrink and expand with temperature, so large slabs must be fitted with<br>
expansion joints. These are most commonly seen as the gaps in roadways and sidewalks, but<br>
they are also built into walls and other structures as well.<br>

etc.).<br>
There are two basic types of mortar: type N and type S.<br>
Type N mortar is used for interior work and exterior work that is above grade (that is, not<br>
buried). It is made by combining:<br>
Lime (one part)<br>
Cement (one part)<br>
Sand (six parts)<br>
Type S mortar is used for below-grade applications such as retaining walls and basements. It<br>
is made by combining:<br>
Lime (one part)<br>
Cement (two parts)<br>
Sand (nine parts)<br>
Water is added to either of these mixtures and worked in with a trowel or a hoe until it reaches<br>
the desired consistency. Both types can be purchased pre-mixed so the mason need only add<br>
the water. Mixing is done on a hard flat surface, often in a wheelbarrow or on a sheet of<br>
plywood, but more properly in a mortar box.<br>

high and ten feet (3.0 meters) long, including an inside or outside corner (surface<br>

Brick<br>
Good bricklaying procedure depends on good workmanship and efficiency. Efficiency involves<br>
doing the work with the fewest possible motions. Each motion should have a purpose and<br>
should accomplish a definite result. After learning the fundamentals, every builder should<br>
develop methods for achieving maximum efficiency. The work must be arranged in such a<br>
way that the Builder is continually supplied with brick and mortar. The scaffolding required<br>
must be planned before the work begins. It must be built in such a way as to cause the least<br>
interference with other crew members.<br>
To efficiently and effectively lay bricks, you must be familiar with the terms that identify the<br>
position of masonry units and mortar joints in a wall. The following list, which is referenced in<br>
Figure 1, provides some of the basic terms you will encounter.<br>
Course<br>
One of several continuous, horizontal layers (or rows) of masonry units bonded together.<br>
Wythe<br>
Each continuous, vertical section of a wall, one masonry unit thick. Sometimes called a<br>
tier.<br>
Stretcher<br>
A masonry unit laid flat on its bed along the length of a wall with its face parallel to the<br>
face of the wall.<br>
Header<br>
A masonry unit laid flat on its bed across the width of a wall with its face perpendicular to<br>
the face of the wall. Generally used to bond two wythes.<br>
Row lock<br>
A header laid on its face or edge across the width of a wall.<br>
Bull header<br>
A rowlock brick laid with its bed perpendicular to the face of the wall.<br>
Bull stretcher<br>
A rowlock brick laid with its bed parallel to the face of the wall.<br>
Soldier<br>
A brick laid on its end with its face perpendicular to the face of the wall.<br>
Bonds<br>
Figure 2<br>
The term “bond” as used in masonry has three different meanings: structural bond, mortar<br>
bond, or pattern bond. Structural bond refers to how the individual masonry units interlock or<br>
tie together into a single structural unit. You can achieve structural bonding of brick and tile<br>
walls in one of three ways:<br>
Overlapping (interlocking) the masonry units<br>
Embedding metal ties in connecting joints<br>
Using grout to adhere adjacent wythes of masonry.<br>
Mortar bond refers to the adhesion of the joint mortar to the masonry units or to the<br>
reinforcing steel. Pattern bond refers to the pattern formed by the masonry units and mortar<br>
joints on the face of a wall. The pattern may result from the structural bond, or may be purely<br>
decorative and unrelated to the structural bond. Figure 2 shows the six basic pattern bonds in<br>
common use today: running, common or American, Flemish, English, stack, and English cross<br>
or Dutch bond.<br>
The running bond is the simplest of the six patterns, consisting of all stretchers. Because the<br>
bond has no headers, metal ties usually form the structural bond.<br>
The common, or American, bond is a variation of the running bond, having a course of fulllength headers at regular intervals that provide the structural bond as well as the pattern.<br>
Header courses usually appear at every fifth, sixth, or seventh course, depending on the<br>
structural bonding requirements. You can vary the common bond with a Flemish header<br>
course. In laying out any bond pattern, be sure to start the corners correctly. In a common<br>
bond, use a three-quarter closure at the corner of each header course.<br>
In the Flemish bond, each course consists of alternating headers and stretchers. The headers<br>
in every other course center over and under the stretchers in the courses in between. The<br>
joints between stretchers in all stretcher courses align vertically. When headers are not<br>
required for structural bonding, you can use bricks called blind headers. You can start the<br>
corners in two different ways. In the Dutch corner, a three-quarter closure starts each course.<br>
In the English corner, a 2-inch or quarter closure starts the course.<br>
The English bond consists of alternating courses of headers and stretchers. The headers<br>
center over and under the stretchers. However, the joints between stretchers in all stretcher<br>
courses do not align vertically. You can use blind headers in courses that are not structural<br>
bonding courses.<br>
The stack bond is purely a pattern bond, with no overlapping units and all vertical joints<br>
aligning. You must use dimensionally accurate or carefully rematched units to achieve good<br>
vertical joint alignment. You can vary the pattern with combinations and modifications of the<br>
basic patterns shown above. This pattern usually bonds to the backing with rigid steel ties or<br>
8-inch-thick stretcher units when available. In large wall areas or load-bearing construction,<br>
insert steel pencil rods into the horizontal mortar joints as reinforcement.<br>
The English cross or Dutch bond is a variation of the English bond. It differs only in that the<br>
joints between the stretchers in the stretcher courses align vertically. These joints center on<br>
the headers in the courses above and below.<br>
When a wall bond has no header courses, use metal ties to bond the exterior wall brick to the<br>
backing courses. Figure 3 shows three typical metal ties.<br>
Figure 3 Metal Masonry Ties<br>
Figure 4 The proper way to hold a trowel<br>
Install flashing at any spot where moisture is likely<br>
to enter a brick masonry structure. Flashing diverts<br>
the moisture back outside. Always install flashing<br>
under horizontal masonry surfaces, such as sills<br>
and copings; at intersections between masonry<br>
walls and horizontal surfaces, such as a roof and<br>
parapet or a roof and chimney; above openings<br>
(doors and windows, for example); and frequently<br>
at floor lines, depending on the type of<br>
construction. The flashing should extend through<br>
the exterior wall face and then turn downward<br>
against the wall face to form a drop.<br>
You should provide weep holes at intervals of 18 to 24 inches to drain water to the outside<br>
that might accumulate on the flashing. Weep holes are even more important when<br>
appearance requires the flashing to stop behind the wall face instead of extending through the<br>
wall. This type of concealed flashing, when combined with tooled mortar joints, often retains<br>
water in the wall for long periods and, by concentrating the moisture at one spot, does more<br>
harm than good.<br>
Mortar Joints and Pointing<br>
There is no set rule governing the thickness of a brick masonry mortar joint. Irregularly<br>
shaped bricks may require mortar joints up to 1/2 inch thick to compensate for the<br>
irregularities. However, mortar joints 1/4 inch thick are the strongest. Use this thickness when<br>
the bricks are regular enough in shape to permit it. A slushed joint is made simply by<br>
depositing the mortar on top of the head joints and allowing it to run down between the bricks<br>
to form a joint. You cannot make solid joints this way. Even if you fill the space between the<br>
bricks completely, there is no way you can compact the mortar against the brick faces;<br>
consequently a poor bond results. The only effective way to build a good joint is to trowel it.<br>
The secret of mortar joint construction and pointing is in how you hold the trowel for<br>
spreading mortar.<br>
Figure 4 shows the correct way to<br>
hold a trowel. Hold it firmly in the grip<br>
shown, with your thumb resting on<br>
top of the handle, not encircling it. If<br>
you are right-handed, pick up mortar<br>
from the outside of the mortar board<br>
pile with the left edge of your trowel.<br>
You can pick up enough to spread<br>
one to five bricks, depending on the<br>
wall space and your skill. A pickup for<br>
one brick forms only a small pile<br>
along the left edge of the trowel. A pickup for five bricks is a full load for a large trowel.<br>

Figure 6 Poor mortar bond<br>
If you are right-handed, work from left to right along<br>
the wall. Holding the left edge of the trowel directly<br>
over the center line of the previous course, tilt the<br>
trowel slightly and move it to the right (view 3),<br>
spreading an equal amount of mortar on each brick<br>
until you either complete the course or the trowel is<br>
empty (view 4). Return any mortar left over to the<br>
mortar board.<br>
Figure 10<br>
Figure 11<br>
Do not spread the mortar for a bed joint too far ahead of laying - four or five brick lengths is<br>
best. Mortar spread out too far ahead dries out before the bricks become bedded and causes<br>
a poor bond. The mortar must be soft and plastic so that the brick will bed in it easily. Spread<br>
the mortar about 1 inch thick and then make a shallow furrow in it (Figure 7, view 1). A furrow<br>
that is too deep leaves a gap between the mortar and the bedded brick. This reduces the<br>
resistance of the wall to water penetration. Using a smooth, even stroke, cut off any mortar<br>
projecting beyond the wall line with the edge of the trowel (view 2). Retain enough mortar on<br>
the trowel to butter the left end of the first brick you will lay in the fresh mortar. Throw the rest<br>
back on the mortar board. Pick up the first brick to be laid with your thumb on one side of the<br>
brick and your fingers on the other. Apply as much mortar as will stick to the end of the brick<br>
and then push it into place (Figure 8). Squeeze out the excess mortar at the head joint and at<br>
the sides. Make sure the mortar completely fills the head joint (Figure 9). After bedding the<br>
brick, cut off the excess mortar and use it to start the next end joint. Throw any surplus<br>
mortar back on the mortar board where it can be restored to workability.<br>
Figure 10 shows how to insert a brick into a space left in a wall. First, spread a thick bed of<br>
mortar (view 1), and then shove the brick into the wall space (view 2) until mortar squeezes<br>
out of all four joints (view 3). This way, you know that the joints are full of mortar at every<br>
point. To make a cross joint in a header course, spread the bed joint mortar several brick<br>
widths in advance. Then, spread mortar over the face of the header brick before placing it in<br>
the wall (Figure 11, view 1). Next, shove the brick into place, squeezing out mortar at the top<br>
of the joint. Finally, cut off the excess mortar as shown in view 2.<br>
Figure 12<br>
Figure 12 shows how to lay a closure brick in a header course. First, spread about 1 inch of<br>
mortar on the sides of the brick already in place (view 1), as well as on both sides of the<br>
closure brick (view 2). Then, lay the closure brick carefully into position without disturbing the<br>
brick already laid (view 3). If you do disturb any adjacent brick, cracks will form between the<br>
brick and mortar, allowing moisture to penetrate the wall. You should place a closure brick for<br>
a stretcher course using the same techniques as for a header course. As we mentioned<br>
earlier, filling exposed joints with mortar immediately after laying a wall is called pointing. You<br>
can also fill holes and correct defective mortar joints by pointing, using a pointing trowel.<br>

Block<br>
Planning<br>
The first step in laying a block wall is to carefully plan the project. When using concrete block<br>
to build a wall, it is important to select the dimensions of the wall based on the size of the<br>
block. Standard concrete blocks are 7 5/8&quot; wide, 7 5/8&quot; deep, and 15 5/8&quot; long. Assuming that<br>
the mortar joint is 3/8&quot; thick brings the block plus mortar dimensions to 8x8x16&quot;. You will<br>
want the outside dimension of the wall to be a multiple of a half-block length (minus one<br>
mortar joint) so that you do not have to cut blocks to a custom size. The height of the wall<br>
should also be a multiple of the block height (including the mortar joint).<br>
Locate the Corners<br>
The first step in building a concrete masonry wall is to locate the corners of the structure. In<br>
locating the corners, you should also make sure the footing or slab formation is level so that<br>
each builder starts each section wall on a common plane. This also helps ensure that the bed<br>
joints are straight when the sections are connected. If the foundation is badly out of level, the<br>
entire first course should be laid before builders begin working on other courses. If this is not<br>
possible, a level plane should be established with a transit or engineer’s level.<br>
Chase Out Bond<br>
The second step is to chase out bond, or lay out, by placing the first course of blocks without<br>

Snap a chalk line to mark the footing and align the blocks accurately. Then, use a piece of<br>
material 3/8 inch thick to properly space the blocks. This helps you get an accurate<br>
measurement.<br>
Lay the Mortar Bed<br>
The third step is to replace the loose blocks with a full mortar bed, spreading and furrowing it<br>
with a trowel to ensure plenty of mortar under the bottom edges of the first course (figure 13,<br>
view 2). Carefully position and align the corner block first (view 3 of figure 14). Lay the<br>
remaining first-course blocks with the thicker end up to provide a larger mortar-bedding area.<br>
For the vertical joints, apply mortar only to the block ends by placing several blocks on end<br>
and buttering them all in one operation (view 4). Make the joints 3/8 inch thick. Then, place<br>
each block in its final position, and push the block down vertically into the mortar bed and<br>
against the previously laid block. This ensures a well-tilled vertical mortar joint (view 5). After<br>
laying three or four blocks, use a mason’s level as a straightedge to check correct block<br>
alignment (figure 14, view 1). Then, use the level to bring the blocks to proper grade and<br>
plumb by tapping with a trowel handle as shown in view 2. Always lay out the first course of<br>
concrete masonry carefully and make sure that you properly align, level, and plumb it. This<br>
assures that succeeding courses and the final wall are both straight and true.<br>
Build Up the Corners<br>
The fourth step is to build up the corners of the wall, usually four or five courses high. This is<br>
also called laying up a lead. Step back each course one-half block. For the horizontal joints,<br>
apply mortar only to the tops of the blocks already laid. For the vertical joints, you can apply<br>
mortar either to the ends of the new block or the end of the block previously laid, or both, to<br>
ensure well-filled joints (figure 15). As you lay each course at the corner, check the course with<br>
a level for alignment (figure 16, view 1), for level (view 2), and for plumb (view 3). Carefully<br>
check each block with a level or straightedge to make sure that all the block faces are in the<br>
same plane. This ensures true, straight walls.<br>
A story or course pole, which is a board with<br>
markings 8 inches apart (figure 17), helps<br>
accurately place each masonry course. Also check<br>
the horizontal block spacing by placing a level<br>
diagonally across the corners of the blocks (figure<br>
18). When filling in the wall between the corners,<br>
first stretch a mason’s line along the extensor block<br>
edges from corner to corner for each course. Then<br>
lay the top outside edge of each new block to this<br>
line (figure 19). How you grip a block before laying is important. First, tip it slightly toward you<br>
so that you can see the edge of the course below. Then place the lower edge of the new block<br>
directly on the edges of the block below (figure 19). Make all position adjustments while the<br>
mortar is soft and plastic. Any adjustments you make after the mortar stiffens will break the<br>
mortar bond and allow water to penetrate. Level each block and align it to the mason’s line by<br>
tapping it lightly with a trowel handle.<br>
Installing the Closure Block<br>

the joints.<br>
Figure 22: Tooled mortar joints for<br>
weathertight exterior walls.<br>
Figure 23:Tooling mortar joints.<br>
Fifth and last, before installing the closure block, butter both edges of the opening and all four<br>
vertical edges of the closure block with mortar. Then, lower the closure block carefully into<br>
place (figure 20). If any mortar falls out, leaving an open joint, remove the block and repeat the<br>
procedure. To assure a good bond, do not spread mortar too far ahead when actually laying<br>
blocks. If you do, the mortar will stiffen and lose its plasticity. The recommended width of<br>
mortar joints for concrete masonry units is 3/8 inch. When properly made, these joints<br>
produce a weathertight, neat, and durable concrete masonry wall.<br>
As you lay each block, cut off excess mortar from the joints using a trowel (figure 21) and<br>
throw it back on the mortar board to rework into the fresh mortar. Do not, however, rework any<br>
mortar dropped on the scaffold or floor. Weathertight joints and the neat appearance of<br>
concrete masonry walls depend on proper striking (tooling). After laying a section of the wall,<br>
tool the mortar joint when the mortar becomes “thumb print” hard. Tooling compacts the<br>
mortar and forces it tightly against the masonry on each side of the joint. Use either concave<br>
or V-shaped tooling on all joints (figure 22).<br>
Tool horizontal joints (figure 23, view 1) with a long jointer first, followed by tooling the vertical<br>
joints (view 2). Trim off mortar burrs from the tooling flush with the wall face using a trowel,<br>
soft bristle brush, or by rubbing with a burlap bag.<br>
A procedure known as pointing may be required after jointing. Pointing is the process of<br>
inserting mortar into horizontal and vertical joints after the unit has been laid. Basically,<br>
pointing is done to restore or replace deteriorated surface mortar in old work. Pointing of this<br>
nature is called tuck pointing. However, even in freshly laid masonry, pointing may be<br>
necessary for filling holes or correcting defective joints.<br>
You must prepare in advance for installing wood plates with anchor bolts on top of hollow<br>
concrete masonry walls. To do this, place pieces of metal lath in the second horizontal mortar<br>
joint from the top of the wall under the cores that will contain the bolts (figure 24, view 1). Use<br>
anchor bolts 1/2 inch in diameter and 18 inches long. Space them not more than 4 feet apart.<br>
Then, when you complete the top course, insert the bolts into the cores of the top two courses<br>
and till the cores with concrete or mortar. The metal lath underneath holds the concrete or<br>
mortar filling in place. The threaded end of the bolt should extend above the top of the wall<br>
(view 2).<br>

A footing is a concrete structure upon which a wall is built. Figure 25 shows a typical footing<br>
formwork for a bearing wall, and figure 26 shows bracing methods for a bearing footing. A<br>
bearing wall, also called a load-bearing wall, is an exterior wall that serves as an enclosure<br>
and also transmits structural loads to the foundation. The form sides are 2-inch lumber whose<br>
width equals the footing depth. Stakes hold the sides in place while spreaders maintain the<br>
correct distance between them. The short braces at each stake hold the form in line. A<br>
keyway is made in the wet concrete by placing a 2-by-2-inch board along the center of the wall<br>
footing form. After the concrete is dry, the board is removed. This leaves an indentation, or<br>
key, in the concrete. When you pour the foundation wall, the key provides a tie between the<br>
footing and wall.<br>
Concrete is strong under compression, but relatively weak under tension. The reverse is true<br>
for steel. Therefore, when the two are combined, one makes up for the deficiency of the other.<br>
When steel is embedded in concrete in a manner that assists it in carrying imposed loads, the<br>
combination is known as reinforced concrete. The steel may consist of welded wire fabric or<br>
expanded metal mesh, but, more often, it consists of reinforcing bars, or more commonly<br>
&quot;rebar.&quot;<br>
Before placing reinforcing steel in forms, use a piece of burlap to clean the bars of rust, scale,<br>
grease, mud, or other foreign matter. A light film of rust or mill scale is not objectionable.<br>
Rebars must be tied together for the bars to remain in a desired arrangement during pouring.<br>
Tying is also a means of keeping laps or splices in place. Laps allow bond stress to transfer<br>
the load from one bar, first into the concrete and then into the second bar.<br>
Once the forms are in place and the rebar has been laid, it is time to mix the concrete. You can<br>
get the dry ingredients premixed and simply add water to it (follow the directions on the bag).<br>
Mixing can be done in a wheelbarrow or in a mixer. Use a hoe to work the water into the<br>
cement until it is thoroughly worked in. Do not add more water to the mix than the bag<br>
indicates is acceptable. Adding too much water will create a weaker concrete. When the<br>
mixing is complete, pour the concrete into the forms. You must then consolidate the concrete.<br>
Consolidation eliminates rock pockets and air bubbles and brings enough fine material both<br>
to the surface and against the forms to produce the desired finish. You can use such hand<br>
tools as spades, puddling sticks, or tampers, but mechanical vibrators are best. Any<br>
compacting device must reach the bottom of the form and be small enough to pass between<br>
reinforcing bars. The process involves carefully working around all reinforcing steel with the<br>
compacting device to assure proper embedding of reinforcing steel in the concrete. Since the<br>
strength of the concrete member depends on proper reinforcement location, be careful not to<br>
displace the reinforcing steel.<br>
Manual consolidation methods require spades, puddling sticks, or various types of tampers.<br>
To consolidate concrete by spading, insert the spade along the inside surface of the forms,<br>
through the layer just placed, and several inches into the layer underneath. Continue spading<br>
or puddling until the coarse aggregate disappears into the concrete.<br>
Finishing<br>
The finishing process provides the final concrete surface. There are many ways to finish<br>
concrete surfaces, depending on the effect required. Sometimes you only need to correct<br>
surface defects, fill bolt holes, or clean the surface. Unformed surfaces may require only<br>
screeding to proper contour and elevation, or a broomed, floated, or troweled finish may be<br>
specified.<br>
Screeding<br>
The top surface of a floor slab, sidewalk, or pavement is rarely placed at the exact specified<br>
elevation. Screeding brings the surface to the required elevation by striking off the excess<br>
concrete. Two types of screeds are used in concrete finishing operations: the hand screed<br>
and the mechanical screed.<br>
Hand screeding requires a tool called a screed. This is actually a template (usually a 2-by-4)<br>
having a straight lower edge to produce a flat surface (or a curved lower edge to produce a<br>
curved surface). Move the screed back and forth across the concrete using a sawing motion.<br>
With each sawing motion, move the screed forward an inch or so along the forms. This forces<br>
the concrete built up against the screed face into the low spots. If the screed tends to tear the<br>
surface, as it may on air-entrained concrete due to its sticky nature, either reduce the rate of<br>
forward movement or cover the lower edge of the screed with metal. This stops the tearing<br>
action in most cases.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">7 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Make the forms and lay a piece of concrete walk or floor, using commercially<br>
mixed cement. Finish it and rule it.<br>
The interpretation of &quot;commercially mixed&quot; cement is up to interpretation. If you call a<br>
concrete company and have them show up with a cement truck, that is certainly &quot;commercial.&quot;<br>
But if it's a small job, you may wish to use &quot;commercially mixed&quot; cement available in bags (just<br>
add water). It's up to you.<br>
To lay a sidewalk or a floor, proceed as described for a footing, but once the screeding is done,<br>
there are additional steps in finishing: floating, edging, and troweling:<br>
Floating<br>
If a smoother surface is required than the one obtained by screeding, the surface should be<br>
worked sparingly with a wood or aluminum magnesium float. The aluminum float, which is<br>
used the same way as the wood float, gives the finished concrete a much smoother surface.<br>
To avoid cracking and dusting of the finished concrete, begin aluminum floating when the<br>
water sheen disappears from the freshly placed concrete surface. Do not use cement or water<br>
as an aid in finishing the surface. Floating has three purposes:<br>
1. to embed aggregate particles just beneath the surface;<br>
2. to remove slight imperfections (high and low spots); and,<br>
3. to compact the concrete at the surface in preparation for other finishing operations.<br>
Begin floating immediately after screeding while the concrete is still plastic and workable.<br>
However, do not overwork the concrete while it is still plastic because you may bring an<br>
excess of water and paste to the surface. This fine material forms a thin, weak layer that will<br>
scale or quickly wear off under use. To remove a coarse texture as the final finish, you usually<br>
have to float the surface a second time after it partially hardens.<br>
Edging<br>
As the sheen of water begins to leave the surface, edging should begin. All edges of a slab<br>
that do not abut another structure should be finished with an edger. An edger dresses corners<br>
and rounds or bevels the concrete edges. Edging the slab helps prevent chipping at the<br>
corners and helps give the slab a finished appearance.<br>
Troweling<br>
If a dense, smooth finish is desired, floating must be followed by steel troweling . Troweling<br>
should begin after the moisture film or sheen disappears from the floated surface and when<br>
the concrete has hardened enough to prevent fine material and water from being worked to<br>
the surface. This step should be delayed as long as possible. Troweling too early tends to<br>
produce crazing and lack of durability. However, too long a delay in troweling results in a<br>
surface too hard to finish properly. The usual tendency is to start to trowel too soon. Troweling<br>
should leave the surface smooth, even, and free of marks and ripples. Spreading dry cement<br>
on a wet surface to take up excess water is not a good practice where a wear-resistant and<br>
durable surface is required. Wet spots must be avoided if possible. When they do occur,<br>
however, finishing operations should not be resumed until the water has been absorbed, has<br>
evaporated, or has been mopped up.<br>
An unslippery, fine-textured surface can be obtained by troweling lightly over the surface with<br>
a circular motion immediately after the first regular troweling. In this process, the trowel is<br>
kept flat on the surface of the concrete. Where a hard steel-troweled finish is required, follow<br>
the first regular troweling by a second troweling. The second troweling should begin after the<br>
concrete has become hard enough so that no mortar adheres to the trowel, and a ringing<br>
sound is produced as the trowel passes over the surface. During this final troweling, the<br>
trowel should be tilted slightly and heavy pressure exerted to thoroughly compact the surface.<br>
Hairline cracks are usually due to a concentration of water and extremely fine aggregates at<br>
the surface. This results from overworking the concrete during finishing operations. Such<br>
cracking is aggravated by drying and cooling too rapidly. Checks that develop before troweling<br>
can usually be closed by pounding the concrete with a hand float.<br>

Adding water to Portland cement to form the water-cement paste that holds concrete<br>

called hydration, produces a stone-like substance — the hardened cement paste. Both the rate<br>
and degree of hydration, and the resulting strength of the final concrete, depend on the curing<br>
process that follows placing and consolidating the plastic concrete. Hydration continues<br>
indefinitely at a decreasing rate as long as the mixture contains water and the temperature<br>
conditions are favorable. Once the water is removed, hydration ceases and cannot be<br>

reaches its design strength. During this period, you must take certain steps to keep the<br>
concrete moist and as near 73°F (23°C) as practical. The properties of concrete, such as<br>
freeze and thaw resistance, strength, watertightness, wear resistance, and volume stability,<br>
cure or improve with age as long as you maintain the moisture and temperature conditions<br>
favorable to continued hydration. The length of time that you must protect concrete against<br>
moisture loss depends on the type of cement used, mix proportions, required strength, size<br>
and shape of the concrete mass, weather, and future exposure conditions. The period can<br>
vary from a few days to a month or longer. For most structural use, the curing period for castin-place concrete is usually 3 days to 2 weeks. This period depends on such conditions as<br>
temperature, cement type, mix proportions, and so forth.<br>

The first postal service in America arose in February of 1692<br>
when a grant from King William and Queen Mary empowered<br>
Thomas Neale <em>to erect, settle and establish within the chief</em><br>
                                                      <em>parts of their majesties' colonies and plantations in America, an</em><br>

                                                      <em>pacquets, and to receive, send and deliver the same under such</em><br>
                                                      <em>rates and sums of money as the planters shall agree to give,</em><br>
                                                      <em>and to hold and enjoy the same for the term of twenty-one</em><br>
                                                      <em>years.</em><br>
The United States Postal Service was created in Philadelphia<br>
under Benjamin Franklin on July 26, 1775 by decree of the<br>
Second Continental Congress. Based on a clause in the<br>
United States Constitution empowering Congress <em>To establish post offices and post roads,</em><br>
it became the Post Office Department in 1792. It was part of the Presidential cabinet and<br>
the postmaster general was the last person in the United States presidential line of<br>
succession. In 1971, the department was reorganized as a quasi-independent agency of<br>
the federal government and acquired its present name. The postmaster general is no<br>
longer in the presidential line of succession.<br>
From 1837 to 1970, the Postal Service used a running pony as its logo; that logo was<br>
replaced by an eagle. In the 1990s, the eagle was redesigned again so that it was just the<br>
head.<br>

Stamps can tell many different stories. For example, the price of first class stamps tells<br>
the history of how much it costs to send first class mail over the years. Also, many<br>
important and not so important persons appear on the stamps. Many of these people<br>
have shaped the history of your country. Additionally, significant events, places, or things<br>
may be commemorated on the stamps, again, documenting a historical event or an era.<br>

Great Britain.<br>
Why? : The stamp was originally for use only within the United Kingdom of Great Britain<br>
and Ireland and as such was in effect initially a local stamp. For this reason the name of<br>
the country was not included within the design, a situation which continued by agreement<br>
with foreign post offices, provided the sovereign’s effigy appeared on the stamp.<br>

A coil stamp is a type of postage stamp sold in strips one stamp wide. The name<br>
derives from the usual handling of long strips, which is to coil them into rolls, in a<br>
manner reminiscent of adhesive tape rolls. A large percentage of modern stamps is<br>
sold in coil form, since they are more amenable to mechanized handling in large<br>
quantities than either sheet stamps or booklet stamps.<br>

A postage stamp booklet is a set of one or more small panes of postage stamps,<br>
usually totalling about 10–20 stamps, folded over and placed in a cardboard cover.<br>
Smaller and easier to handle than a whole sheet of stamps, in many countries<br>
booklets have become a favored way to purchase stamps.<br>

A perforation is a hole made by puncturing a surface. However, the term frequently<br>
refers to the practice of creating a long series of holes so that paper can be torn<br>
more easily. Postage stamps are one common application of this, where small<br>
round holes are cut in lines to create individual pieces.<br>

A definitive postage stamp is a regular issue stamp that is part of a definitive issue<br>
or definitive series consisting of a range of denominations sufficient to cover all<br>
postal rates usefully. (An &quot;issue&quot; generally means a set that is put on sale all at the<br>
same time, while a &quot;series&quot; is spread out over several years, but the terms are not<br>
precise.)<br>

A commemorative stamp is a postage stamp issued to honor or commemorate a<br>
place, event or person. Most postal services of the world issue several of these<br>
each year, often holding first day of issue ceremonies at locations connected with<br>
the subjects. Commemorative stamps are usually used alongside ordinary or<br>
regular-issue stamps of the time, although in some cases their use has been<br>
obligatory.<br>

Stamp hinges are small, folded, rectangular pieces of paper coated with a mild<br>
gum. They are used by stamp collectors to affix postage stamps onto the pages of<br>
a stamp album. The short end is moistened and affixed to the stamp, the long end<br>
is likewise affixed to the page. The hinge keeps the stamp on the page while still<br>
allowing it to be lifted to examine the back (for instance to see the watermark or<br>
expert marks).<br>

Do not soak stamps from differently colored paper together.<br>
Use lukewarm water.<br>
Make sure the stamps are completely submerged.<br>
If the stamp does not pull away cleanly, try soaking it more.<br>
Dry each stamp separately, face down on newspaper (no colors on newspaper).<br>
Do not allow stamps to touch each other or overlay while drying.<br>

This is a hands on requirement, but all we can provide is some descriptions. An easy way to<br>
do this is at a fabric store. If teaching this honor to a group, you could collect a variety of<br>
samples and label them on the back with a marker.<br>

The term wool is usually restricted to describing the fibrous protein derived from the<br>
specialized skin cells called follicles in sheep.<br>
Wool is taken from animals in the Caprinae family, principally sheep, but the hair of<br>
certain species of other mammals is also sometimes called &quot;wool&quot;, including<br>
cashmere from goats, mohair from goats, vicuña, alpaca, and camel from animals in<br>
the camel family, and angora from rabbits.<br>
Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped, it has a<br>
different texture or handle, it is elastic, and it grows in staples (clusters).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Worsted wool<br>
Worsted (pronounced /ˈwʊstɨd/), is the name of a yarn, the cloth made from this yarn,<br>
and a yarn weight category. The name derives from the village of Worstead in the<br>
English county of Norfolk. This village became, along with North Walsham and<br>
Aylsham, a center for the manufacture of yarn and cloth after weavers from Flanders<br>
arrived in Norfolk in the 12th century. Worsted cloth, archaically also known as stuff, is<br>
lightweight and has a coarse texture. The weave is usually twill or plain. Twilled fabrics<br>
such as whipcord, gabardine and serge are often made from worsted yarn. Worsted<br>
fabric made from wool has a natural recovery, meaning that it is resilient and quickly<br>
returns to its natural shape, but non-glossy worsted will shine with use or abrasion.<br>
Worsteds differ from woolens, in that the natural crimp of the wool fiber is removed in<br>
the process of spinning the yarn. In Tropical Worsteds this use of tightly-spun<br>
straightened wool combined with a looser weave permits the free flow of air through<br>
the fabric.<br>
Worsted is also used for carpets, garments, hosiery, gloves and baize.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Cotton<br>
Cotton makes a soft, breathable textile. Shiny cotton is a processed version of the fiber<br>
that can be made into cloth resembling satin for shirts and suits. However, it is<br>
hydrophobic (does not absorb water easily), which makes it unfit for use in bath and<br>
dish towels. The name Egyptian cotton is broadly associated with quality products,<br>
however only a small percentage of Egyptian cotton production is actually of superior<br>
quality. Most products bearing the name are not made with the finest cottons from<br>
Egypt.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Linen<br>
Linen is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant. Linen is laborious to<br>
manufacture, but the fiber is very absorbent and garments made of linen are valued for<br>
their exceptional coolness and freshness in hot weather. Many products are made of<br>
linen: aprons, bags, towels (swimming, bath, beach, body and wash towels), napkins,<br>
bed linens, tablecloths, runners, chair covers, and men's and women's wear.<br>
Textiles in a linen weave texture, even when made of cotton, hemp and other non-flax<br>
fibers, are also loosely referred to as &quot;linen&quot;. The collective term &quot;linens&quot; is still often<br>
used generically to describe a class of woven or knitted bed, bath, table and kitchen<br>
textiles traditionally made of linen. In the past, &quot;linens&quot; also referred to lightweight<br>
undergarments such as shirts, chemises, waist shirts, lingerie (a word also cognate<br>
with linen), and detachable shirt collars and cuffs, all of which were historically made<br>
almost exclusively out of linen. The inner layer of fine composite cloth garments (as for<br>
example jackets) was traditionally made of linen, hence the word lining.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Silk<br>
The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry<br>
silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of<br>
silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fiber, which allows silk cloth<br>
to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1f </span><span style="color:#212529;">Artificial silk<br>
Artificial silk or (as the term is used in the textile industry) &quot;art silk&quot; is any synthetic<br>
fiber which resembles silk, but typically costs less to produce. In the present day,<br>
imitation silk may be made with rayon, mercerized cotton, polyester, a blend of these<br>
materials, or a blend of rayon and silk. When made out of bamboo viscose it is also<br>
sometimes called bamboo silk.<br>
The first successful artificial silks were developed in the 1890s of cellulose fiber and<br>
marketed as art silk or viscose, a trade name for a specific manufacturer. In 1924, the<br>
name of the fiber was officially changed in the U.S. to rayon, although the term viscose<br>
continued to be used in Europe and it is also called &quot;viscose rayon&quot;.<br>
In 1931, Henry Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert to produce artificial<br>
silk made with soybean fibers. They succeeded in making a textile fiber of spun soy<br>
protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name<br>
Azlon. It was usable in the making of suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot<br>
production of Azlon reached 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg) per day in 1940, it never reached<br>
the commercial market; Du Pont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce<br>
artificial silk.<br>
Nylon, the first synthetic fiber, was developed in the United States in the late 1930s by<br>
Du Pont to become a cheaper and superior replacement for silk stockings, which are<br>
usually called &quot;nylons&quot; today. Although nylon is not a good substitute for silk fabric in<br>
appearance, it is a successful functional alternative. Nylon's properties when wet are<br>
far superior to rayon and silk. Nylon became a prominent industrial fiber in a short time<br>
frame, permanently replacing silk in many applications.<br>
Two years after nylon's launch, Japanese silk became unavailable at the start of World<br>
War II. The US government redirected nylon production to military applications, such as<br>
parachutes.<br>
Despite a generally similar appearance, genuine silk has unique features that are<br>
distinguishable from artificial silk. However, in some cases art silk can be passed off<br>
as real silk to unwary buyers. A number of tests are available to determine a fabric's<br>
basic fiber makeup, some of which can be performed prior to purchasing a fabric<br>
whose composition is questionable. Tests include rubbing the pile in your hand,<br>
burning a small piece of the fringe to smell the ash and smell the smoke and dissolving<br>
the pile by performing a chemical test.<br>
Frequently, &quot;artificial silk&quot; is just a synonym for rayon.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">1g </span><span style="color:#212529;">Rayon<br>
Rayon is a manufactured regenerated cellulose fiber. It is made from purified cellulose,<br>
primarily from wood pulp, which is chemically converted into a soluble compound. It is<br>
then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments which are<br>
chemically solidified, resulting in synthetic fibers of nearly pure cellulose. Because<br>
rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semisynthetic fiber. Specific types of rayon include viscose, modal and lyocell, each of<br>
which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product.<br>
Rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as<br>
natural fibers, although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like<br>
nylon. It can imitate the feel and texture of silk, wool, cotton and linen. The fibers are<br>
easily dyed in a wide range of colors. Rayon fabrics are soft, smooth, cool, comfortable,<br>
and highly absorbent, but they do not insulate body heat, making them ideal for use in<br>
hot and humid climates, although also making their &quot;hand&quot; (feel) cool and sometimes<br>
almost slimy to the touch.<br>
The durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayon are low, especially<br>
when wet; also, rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber. However, HWM rayon<br>
(high-wet-modulus rayon) is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and<br>
appearance retention. Recommended care for regular viscose rayon is dry-cleaning<br>
only. HWM rayon can be machine washed.<br>

Polyester is a category of polymers that contain the ester functional group in their main<br>
chain. Fabrics woven or knitted from polyester thread or yarn are used extensively in<br>
apparel and home furnishings and in many industrial applications. Polyester fabrics are<br>
highly stain-resistant, in fact they require a very special class of dyes to color the fabric.<br>
Plain weave<br>
Polyester fibers are sometimes spun together with natural fibers to produce a cloth<br>
with blended properties. Cotton mixed with Polyester blends can be strong, wrinkle and<br>
tear-resistant and has reduced shrinking properties. Synthetic fibers in polyester also<br>
create materials with water, wind and environmental resistance compared to plantderived fibers. Cons of cotton and polyester blends include being less breathable than<br>
cotton and trapping more moisture while sticking to the skin. They are also less fire<br>
resistant and can melt when ignited.<br>
Polyester blends have been renamed so as to suggest their similarity or even<br>
superiority to natural fibers (for example, China silk, which is a term in the textiles<br>
industry for a 100% polyester fiber woven to resemble the look and durability of insectderived silk).<br>

One form of Synthetic wool is known as &quot;Polar fleece&quot; and is commonly used in jackets,<br>
hats, sweaters, sweatpants, cloth diapers, gym clothes, hoodies, inexpensive throw<br>
blankets, and high-performance outdoor clothing. It can be used as a vegan alternative<br>
to wool. It can be made partially from recycled plastic bottles and is very light, soft and<br>
easy to wash.<br>
One of the first forms was Polar Fleece was created in Massachusetts in 1979 by<br>
Malden Mills, now Polartec LLC. This was a new, light, and strong pile fabric meant to<br>
mimic—and in some ways surpass—wool. The owner of the company, </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Aaron Feuerstein<br>

cheaply and widely by many vendors, leading to the material's quick and wide<br>
acceptance.<br>

Plain or tabby weave is the most basic of the three<br>
fundamental types of textile weaves. It is strong and<br>
hardwearing, used for fashion and furnishing fabrics.<br>
In plain weave the warp and weft are aligned so that<br>
they form a simple crisscross pattern. Each weft thread<br>
crosses the warp threads by going over one, then under<br>
the next, and so on. The next weft thread goes under<br>
the warp threads that its neighbor went over, and vice<br>
versa. Plain weave is also known as &quot;tabby weave&quot; or<br>
&quot;taffeta weave.&quot;<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Basket<br>
Basketweave is a variation of plain weave in which two or more threads are bundled<br>
and then woven as one in the warp or weft, or both.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">Rib weave is a variation of Plain weave that has the same basic construction under and<br>
over the warp yarns in the pattern of one under, one over and so on. The difference is<br>
that Rib weave uses one heavyweight yarn resulting in raised ribs either horizontally or<br>
vertically down the fabric, depending on whether the heavier, thicker yarn is used for<br>
the warp or the weft. Rib weave fabrics may be color woven to create striped or plaid<br>
fabrics.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Twill<br>
Twill is a type of fabric woven with a pattern of diagonal<br>
parallel ribs.<br>
It is made by passing the weft threads over one warp<br>
thread and then under two or more warp threads, over<br>
one and under two or more, and so on, with a &quot;step&quot; or<br>
offset between rows that creates the characteristic<br>
diagonal pattern. Because of this structure, twills<br>
generally drape well. Examples of twill fabric are chino,<br>
denim, gabardine, tweed and serge.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Herringbone<br>
A herringbone weave is made by passing the weft over<br>
two warp threads and under the next two. On the next<br>
pass the over-under pattern is offset by one so that the<br>
weft passes between two warp threads that the<br>
previous weft went over.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2f </span><span style="color:#212529;">Pile<br>
Pile weave is a form of textile created by weaving. Pile fabrics used to be made on<br>
traditional hand weaving machines. The warp ends that are used for the formation of<br>
the pile are woven over metal rods or wires that are inserted in the shed (gap caused by<br>
raising alternate threads) during weaving. The pile ends lie in loops over the inserted<br>
rods. When a rod is extracted the pile ends remain as loops on top of the base fabric.<br>
The pile ends laying over the rod may be left as 'loop pile', or cut to form 'cut pile' or<br>
velvet.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3 </span><span style="color:#212529;">How are the following used?<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Interlining<br>
Interlining is extra fabric added to a garment to increase warmth, such as in coats.<br>
Interlining can be removable or integral to the garment. </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Compare to similar terms<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Tailor tacks<br>
To transfer pattern markings to fabric, or to otherwise<br>
mark the point where two pieces of fabric are to be joined.<br>
A special loose looped stitch used for this purpose is<br>
called a tack or tailor's tack. This is often done through two<br>
opposing layers of the same fabric so that when the<br>
threads are snipped between the layers the stitches will be<br>
in exactly the same places for both layers thus saving time<br>
having to chalk and tack the other layer.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Tailor canvas or other interfacing<br>
Interfacing is a support fabric used in areas that need more stability than just the fabric<br>
weight. It is different then interlining because it has a different purpose. Examples of<br>
places you may want to add interfacing are collars, cuffs, waistbands, closures (like<br>
buttonholes), and sometimes hems.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3d </span><span style="color:#212529;">Pad stitching<br>
Pad stitches are a type of running stitch made by placing small stitches perpendicular<br>
to the line of stitching. Pad stitches secure two or more layers of fabric together and<br>
give the layers more firmness. They may also be used to enforce an overall curvature of<br>
the layers. Tailors pad stitch a jacket's lapel and undercollar to give them additional<br>
firmness, and maintain their curvature.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3e </span><span style="color:#212529;">Iron-on interfacing<br>
Interfacing is a textile used on the unseen or &quot;wrong&quot; side of fabrics to make an area of<br>
a garment more rigid. Iron-on interfacings contains a heat activated adhesive that<br>
sticks when the fabric is ironed on to the garment.<br>

tailored.<br>
Without a proper fit, even the most fashionable clothes are not going to make you look your<br>
best. When you see celebrities and think how good they lock even in simple clothes, the<br>
reason is that the tailor all their clothes.<br>
We all have different bodies, so off the rack clothes just are never ideal for us. Nearly<br>
everything you buy can be improved so you may choose to modify your clothing to improve<br>
the fit. A common strategy is to look for clothes that are close to a good fit, and can be<br>
inexpensively adjusted.<br>

A tailor's ham or dressmaker's ham is a tightly stuffed pillow used as a curved mold<br>
when pressing curved areas of clothing, such as darts, sleeves, cuffs, collars, or<br>
waistlines. Pressing on a curved form allows a garment better to fit body contours.<br>

A needle board is a pressing tool constructed of heavy canvas which covers a layer of<br>
rubber. A needle board has hundreds of tiny needle-like wires about 1/2” long. It is used<br>
needles up, with the napped fabric (such as velvet, velveteen or wide wale corduroy)<br>
placed face down so that the nap falls into the depth of the needles without being<br>
crushed. Spread the fabric over the needles and steamed with an iron or steamer.<br>

                                                      <em>How are glazed and unglazed tiles made differently?</em><br>
In terms of how they are manufactured, there is no difference between glazed and<br>
unglazed ceramic and porcelain tile, other than the fact that glazed tiles undergo an<br>
additional phase in the firing process. During this additional process, a layer of liquid<br>
glass is added to glazed tiles by means of very high temperatures.<br>
                                                      <em>Performance of unglazed ceramic and porcelain tile</em><br>
Unglazed tiles tend to be denser and thicker than glazed tiles, and because of their<br>
unfinished exteriors, they tend to be a great choice if you’re looking for a slip resistant<br>
surface in an area like a laundry room or kitchen where the tile is likely to be subjected<br>
to high amounts of moisture. In terms of safety, this is a big consideration. For areas<br>
with heavy foot traffic, as well as outdoor applications (in milder climates), unglazed<br>
tiles are a very good choice.<br>
Along with safety benefits, unglazed ceramic and porcelain tiles are sought after<br>
because of their scratch resistance and natural beauty. Since they’re colored by the<br>
mineral deposits from where the clay was originally taken, these tiles offer an earthy<br>
aesthetic quality. A limitation of unglazed ceramic and porcelain is their vulnerability to<br>
staining. As a precaution, it’s a good idea to use a sealant and wax after installing<br>
unglazed ceramic tile indoors.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">[1]<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;"><em>Performance of glazed ceramic and porcelain tile</em><br>
Although glazed ceramic and porcelain tile are a little less robust in terms of density<br>
and thickness than their unglazed counterpart, they allow for a wider range of styles<br>
and colors. Glazed tiles also tend to be more resistant to staining, as they’re protected<br>
by a non-porous layer of liquid glass.<br>
When it comes to the glaze itself, different options are available and will impact the<br>
degree of durability. Some varieties of glazed tile are fired at higher temperatures than<br>
others, and therefore are harder as well. This can often be determined by how light or<br>
dark the glaze is, with lighter glazes generally being harder than darker glazes.<br>
Then there is the issue of gloss: matte and satin finishes are generally harder than<br>
shiny finishes. As always, it’s a good idea to try and strike a balance between<br>
practicality and decorative taste when choosing your glazed ceramic and porcelain tile.<br>
Whether you choose glazed or unglazed tile, both types have their own unique qualities.<br>
As always, it’s best to know the needs of your space and the look you are after. This<br>
way, your flooring project will be something you can enjoy for many years in the future.<br>

Benefits of Marble Tile<br>
For centuries, marble tiles have been a symbol of affluence, exuding sophistication and<br>
an air of artistry that make marble tile a classic choice. A common feature in the Greek<br>
and Roman spas of the ancient world, to Renaissance courtyards in Europe, all the way<br>
to Trump Tower in New York City today, marble has been a natural stone on which is<br>
heavily relied.<br>

10 different tile patterns<br>
                                                      <em>Straight (or Stack Bond)</em><br>
The most common and simplest tiling pattern. The tiles are laid in straight lines so the grout<br>
lines end up like a grid. A great tip when buying your tiles is to make sure that they all have the<br>
same batch number. Different batches may have slight color variations that will show up in<br>
the finished product. You’ll find the batch number on the packaging.<br>
                                                      <em>Diagonal</em><br>
Diagonal is similar to the straight pattern except the tiles are laid on a 45-degree angle, turning<br>
square tiles into diamonds. This style can be used with a border as a feature in a kitchen<br>
splashback or for an entire floor to make a small room look bigger. It’s perfect for the<br>
bathroom.<br>
                                                      <em>Herringbone</em><br>
Perfect for hallways or outdoor paths, as the “V” in the pattern acts like arrows pointing you in<br>
the right direction, the herringbone pattern is achieved by laying rectangular tiles in a zigzag<br>
pattern.<br>
                                                      <em>Basket Weave</em><br>
Also using rectangular tiles, the basket weave pattern has two tiles laid next to each other to<br>
form a square. The following pair of tiles are laid at 90 degrees to the first and so on. The<br>
horizontal and vertical tiles then alternate on following rows. This gives the impression that<br>
the tiles are woven over and under each other like a basket.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">[5]<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;"><em>Windmill</em><br>
To create the windmill pattern, four rectangular tiles are arranged around a square tile in the<br>
center. Using a square tile and grout in a contrasting color to the rectangles really make this<br>
pattern stand out. It can look busy on a floor but is good for a shower or as a border.<br>
                                                      <em>Pin Wheel (also called Hopscotch)</em><br>
Similar to the windmill, this design uses a small square tile surrounded by much larger square<br>
tiles to create the effect of a spinning pinwheel. Tiles in contrasting colors should be chosen<br>
for the best effect.<br>
                                                      <em>Stretcher Bond</em><br>
Stretcher bond uses square or rectangular tiles that are laid like bricks in a wall. The end of<br>
each tile is lined up with the center of the tiles that are both directly above and below it. This<br>
creates a staggered, but cohesive look.<br>
                                                      <em>Cobblestone</em><br>
This pattern starts with rectangular tiles laid in the herringbone style. Around the edges of<br>
these it has smaller square tiles to create a larger pattern that is then repeated across the<br>
floor. This is a look suited to more traditional styles.<br>
                                                      <em>English Bond</em><br>
English bond uses alternating rows of rectangular and square tiles. The square tiles are<br>
centered on the rectangles and the ends of all the tiles line up between rows.<br>
                                                      <em>English Cross Bond</em><br>
Similar to the English bond except that the rectangular tiles in the alternating rows are<br>
staggered like the pattern in a stretcher bond.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4a </span><span style="color:#212529;">Mastic<br>
Mastic is an organic glue made from the sticky resin of the mastic tree. It’s available as<br>
a thin-liquid, thick glue, or a sticky paste. Liquid Nails® would be a notable example of<br>
the thin-liquid form where it comes in a caulking tube and is squeezed out along a wall<br>
or joists to hold load-bearing walls and ceilings in place. It’s also used as a temporary<br>
hold for fixtures so they can easily be screwed into place by one person.<br>
Mastic as a tile adhesive has a number of drawbacks, since it’s organic, it can harbor<br>
mold in high-moisture areas, it also will re-liquefy when submerged in water and lose<br>
its adhesive strength. Some manufacturers are promoting their tile adhesive as waterresistant and safe when subjected to limited moisture exposure, they further claim that<br>
it can be safely used to tile the walls of tub surrounds. This is where we personally<br>
have questions. It’s not that we take issue with the specific language used by the<br>
manufacturers, we just have an issue with what we perceive as a disregard for reality<br>
when making their claim.<br>
Mastic tile adhesives are a great time-saver when laying tile, but knowing the laws of<br>
physics and nature, we feel that mastic adhesive is not appropriate for use anywhere<br>
where moisture is present. Although the manufacturer is correct in stating that tile will<br>
hold up to limited water exposure, who’d want to choose mastic over thinset when<br>
using it in an area where limited water exposure could possibly end up being “more<br>
than limited”.<br>
Let’s say you laid tile in your shower using mastic and you shower in it daily. Everything<br>
will work out fine if your tiles remain properly sealed and no cracks form in the grout,<br>
and your shower-head performs perfectly. But what will happen if you’ve formed a tiny<br>
little crack in a tiny little area of your properly sealed tile where moisture not only<br>
penetrates, but has a tendency to wick and spread? Will your mastic adhesive hold up?<br>
What if the mastic does hold up when a little bit of moisture penetrates? What about<br>
the organic property of mastic? All that’s needed for mold growth is moisture and an<br>
organic food source. Mastic is food for mold! Another drawback is that mastic doesn’t<br>
provide much structural support and cannot be used to build up minor “off of level”<br>
imperfections in a floor. You’ll end up with more “tile lippage”, in the end this tile lippage<br>
will have an impact on the overall aesthetics of your tile project.<br>
Although there are drawbacks with mastic, there are advantages. Mastic has superior<br>
holding strength, easier to apply, and sets quickly. When used to tile walls it’s strength<br>
allows you to set tile, and if you’re good with eyeballing, you can set tile without the use<br>
of spacers. If you attempt to set wall tiles using thinset without spacers, you’ll end up<br>
with a bunch of tiles that have slid into each other before the thinset has had time to<br>
set, resulting in a giant mess.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">4b </span><span style="color:#212529;">Thinset<br>
Thinset mortar is like Portland Cement, only thinner. It’s a mixture of cement, finely<br>
set o ta s e o t a d Ce e t, o y t e . ts a tu e o ce e t, e y<br>
graded sand, and a water-retention compound that allows the cement to properly<br>
hydrate. You’ll find thin-set sold with the words “thin set cement”, “thin-set mortar”,<br>
“dryset mortar”, and “drybond mortar”. Whatever name you find it as, we’re talking<br>
about the same thing. Thinset is designed to adhere well in a thin layer that’s typically<br>
not greater than 3/16″ thick. Thinset also provides structural support so that very minor<br>
adjustments in height can be made.<br>
There’s also a medium bed thinset mortar which is a variation that’s used for slightly<br>
larger applications. This is used with large, heavy or thick tiles. Then there’s yet another<br>
variation of thinset for thick-bed installations. Thick bed installations generally are<br>
based on the traditional method of packing a mortar bed of a surface before installing<br>
the tile. The tile can be adhered to the mortar bed either while the mortar bed is<br>
beginning to dry or after the mortar bed has cured.<br>
The advantages of thin-set is that it can be used in areas where there are high amounts<br>
of moisture present. Although thin-set is not waterproof, it is water soluble. When<br>
moisture is present, it will not return to a liquefied state as mastic would. Another<br>
advantage is that it’s inorganic and thus is not a food source for mold growth.<br>

The most common adhesive for setting tiles is thinset mortar—that is, mortar designed to be<br>
applied in a layer no more than ³⁄</span><span style="color:#212529;">݂</span><span style="color:#212529;"> </span><span style="color:#212529;">ޠ</span><span style="color:#212529;">in. thick. Most of these mortars are available in either gray<br>
or white. If you intend to use a dark-colored grout, choose a gray mortar; choose white if your<br>
grout will be a light color. Achieving a white color requires modifications in the manufacturing<br>
process, so expect to pay a few more dollars for white mortar than gray.<br>

                                                      <em>Should You Seal the Tile or the Grout?</em><br>
It's important to realize that there are two parts of a tile floor: the tile and the grout. Most of<br>
the floor is made up of the actual tiles but the grout is just as important. It's the often<br>
overlooked material that holds the tiles in place. Grout needs to be sealed. It's naturally<br>
porous and will stain easily. Most installers of tile floors do not seal them, because grout has<br>
to cure first. It's something you should do to keep your grout looking its best. As a bonus,<br>
sealed grout is much easier to keep clean.<br>
                                                      <em>When to Seal Tiles</em><br>
Sealing is done to strengthen tile or grout's defenses against dirt, spills, and erosion of grout,<br>
but not all tile needs to be sealed. If your tile is ceramic or porcelain, it probably won't need to<br>
be sealed. There are some exceptions to this, so check with your manufacturer to be sure. If<br>

your tile is stone (slate, marble, granite, travertine, etc.) then it will need to be sealed. Stone is<br>
naturally porous and will absorb spills and stain fairly easily.<br>

center of the room?<br>
For those new to laying tile, the temptation is to pick the straightest wall and start laying the<br>
floor along it. While that may work with other flooring materials, tiles must begin from the<br>
center of the room. This gives you plenty of space to work outward to the walls and ensure a<br>
symmetrical pattern.<br>
The first and foremost rule of tile layout: Make sure your pattern is square. Before laying your<br>
first tile, snap a couple of chalk lines to guide the installation.<br>
The Quarter Method<br>
A standard procedure for tile layout is the quarter method, in which the room is actually<br>
divided into four quarters to help sequence the layout. First step is to measure and mark the<br>
midpoint of all four walls. Snap intersecting chalk lines at the center point of the site, forming<br>
a square cross. Use the 3-4-5 rule to check that the lines form right angles. Measure and mark<br>
a point 4 feet from the center along one line. Measure and mark a point 3 feet from the center<br>
on the intersecting line. A diagonal line between the two points should measure 5 feet if the<br>
chalk lines are at 90 degrees. If that’s not the case, then re-adjust your chalk lines.<br>
A large A-square can make checking your guide lines a snap. Just align the A-square with the<br>
chalk-line intersection to make sure the lines are at right angles.<br>
Once the chalk lines are square, lay out the entire floor in a dry run, with no mortar. Start by<br>
laying a row of tiles along each of the four lines, all the way to the walls, creating a cross of<br>
tiles in the center of the room. If necessary, use plastic spacers to keep the grout joints even.<br>
At the ends of the walls you will likely be faced with a space that’s too small for the width of a<br>
last tile. If this space is less than half the width of a tile, adjust the layout so that the last tile<br>
along the wall will be at least half the standard size. Also, check that the last row of tiles<br>
against each wall is uniform in size so the room’s layout will be symmetrical. If not, adjust<br>
accordingly.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">[9]<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">Then fill in the remaining fields of each quarter, keeping the tiles square and the spacing<br>
uniform. Work from the intersection toward the walls. Once the tiles are laid for the dry run,<br>
you can adjust the placement of individual tiles based on color harmony or texture. Just<br>
create a system to help you remember where to place them during the actual installation.<br>
The quarter method is a standard procedure for laying out all tile sizes, shapes and materials.<br>
In order to lay the tiles in a staggered fashion, such as a running bond pattern, lay the tiles<br>
only along one axis of the intersecting chalk lines. Work from the center, filling in the<br>
quadrants and offsetting the grout joints from row to row.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8 </span><span style="color:#212529;">When should backerboard (CBU) be used during tile installation? Briefly describe<br>
proper backerboard installation.<br>
Cement board is often called a cementitious backer unit (CBU) or backer board. Unlike woodbased materials such as drywall, greenboard, or plywood, CBUs have no organic matter that<br>
will cause mold, rot, shrinkage, or decomposition. Also, because there is no cellular material in<br>
cement boards, it does not draw in moisture like cellulose materials do.<br>
Cement backer board is the recommended substrate below tile.<br>
If you have a good, smooth cement board surface, your tile work will go easier and the results<br>
will be smoother. You will have less chance of lippage (tile edges of various heights) and a<br>
greater chance that your tile will last for a longer time without cracking. CBUs are high value,<br>
low cost items that can only make your tile work look better.<br>
                                                      <em>What Goes Below Your Cement Board?</em><br>
Because cement board can be used either for floors or walls, the surface below the cement<br>
board will vary.<br>
Flooring: Your backer board will usually rest on top of plywood subfloor(minimum 5/8&quot;<br>
exterior-grade plywood or even OSB), with the tile atop the backer board. If the bottom-most<br>
surface is concrete, there is no reason to install backer board on the concrete. If height is not<br>
a problem and you wish to save time, you can lay your backer board on top of existing finish<br>
floor as long as it is in good shape.<br>
Walls: For highly wet areas like showers and bathtub surrounds, the CBU should be installed<br>
directly on studs with an intervening waterproof membrane. Walls that you expect to stay dry<br>
need no membrane. If you are installing your CBU in a high moisture area, you should not<br>
install onto drywall or greenboard. First remove and demolish the board, then install directly<br>
on the studs (with the intervening membrane).<br>
1. Purchase the Right Size CBU<br>
Cement board, regardless of brand, tends to come in 3 foot x 5 foot sheets, each about 30<br>
pounds for 1/4 inch board and 36-44 pounds for 1/2 inch board.<br>
Sheets measuring 4 foot x 8 foot are available but tend to be unmanageable by most DIYers.<br>
Use gloves when handling as edges are sharp. In transporting CBUs, be cautious as it is easy<br>
to break or crack the boards. If only for this reason, bring a partner along when you buy the<br>
CBUs.<br>
Floors: 1/4 inch minimum thickness is needed.<br>
Walls: Use 1/2 inch or 5/8 inch thick cement board, not 1/4 inch. The extra thickness is<br>
needed to span the studs and provide a solid base for the tile.<br>
Countertops: 1/4 inch, 1/2 inch, or 5/8 inch thick.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">[10]<br>

All available at major home improvement stores, popular brands of cement board include:<br>
HardieBacker: Imprinted with a 1 inch by 1 inch grid for easier tile-setting, James Hardie<br>
Industries' HardieBacker is 90% Portland cement and sand, with a patented MoldBlock<br>
additive.<br>
Durock: USG's Durock tends to run lighter than equally sized HardieBacker.<br>
Denshield: From Georgia-Pacific, DenShield is a two-in-one product, combining cement<br>
board and waterproof membrane. Although DenSheild works in dry applications, it makes<br>
more economical sense to confine it to wet applications due to the membrane.<br>
Wonderboard: Wonderboard is often a cheaper cement board choice, over other brands<br>
per 3' foot x 5 foot sheet.<br>
Since major home improvement drivers Home Depot and Lowe's carry HardieBacker and<br>
Durock, respectively, most do-it-yourself homeowners end up using either of those two<br>
brands.<br>
3. Lay Out CBUs In a Dry Run<br>
Lay out boards but do not affix to the subfloor yet. Mark partial boards by drawing cut lines on<br>
the surface of the cement board with a carpenter's pencil.<br>
Where the board must go around irregular obstructions, such as plumbing pipes, toilets, etc.,<br>
draw a template on contractor's paper, cut out the template with scissors, then transfer that<br>
pattern to the backer board with pencil.<br>
4. Cut Partial Boards and For Obstructions<br>
If you have any obstructions to work around, cut the cement board with a SkilSaw outfitted<br>
with a carbide blade.<br>
Safety glasses are not optional--cutting cement board is a messy process. An alternative,<br>
cleaner way is to score the mesh side with a utility knife and snap off.<br>
5. Butter Surface with Thinset<br>
Apply thinset mortar on the surface where you will be affixing the cement board. Using basic<br>
tiling techniques, &quot;comb&quot; the thin-set mortar with your notched trowel.<br>
6. Install Boards<br>
Lay down the cement boards, keeping them 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; apart. With your cordless drill, screw<br>
the cement boards down with the cement board screws along the edges, every 8&quot;. Screw<br>
heads should be slightly below the cement board surface.<br>
You do not want screw heads protruding, or you will have problems when you lay down the<br>
tile.<br>
7. Tape Seams<br>
Cover seams with fiberglass seam tape. Fill in and smooth with mortar. Let dry.<br>

1 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Discuss with your instructor the meaning of the motto: &quot;Take nothing but pictures<br>
and leave nothing but footprints.&quot;<br>
&quot;Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints&quot; is pretty self-explanatory. It means<br>
you do not disturb nature while you are out enjoying it. If you see a pretty rock, leave it there<br>
for someone else to enjoy. If you eat a piece of candy on the trail, don't toss the wrapper —<br>
take it with you.<br>
There are a few exception to both these rules. If you see trash, by all means, take it. Throw it in<br>
the trash when you get to a proper trash receptacle. Also be aware that footprints are not<br>
always harmless. Many tundra plants that take years to grow can be destroyed by a single<br>
footprint. Stay on the trail.<br>
One of the most important ways people leave their mark on the land is by building a campfire.<br>
For &quot;no trace&quot; camping, bring a camp stove. Unfortunately, the campfire is one of the primary<br>
attractions for many people, so it is not easy to follow this advice. If your campsite has a fire<br>
ring or an existing fire pit, use that. If it does not and you <em>must </em>have a campfire, lay a small<br>
tarp on the ground and cover it with six to eight inches of mineral sand. Mineral sand is sand<br>
containing no organic material, and can be found on a beach or where a large tree has fallen<br>
over and raised a rootwad. The sand must be piled deep so the heat does not affect the tarp<br>
beneath. Stop putting new fuel on the fire well before you are ready to put it out, and push in<br>
the ends of sticks that have not yet burned. Allow them to burn down to white ash. When you<br>
are ready to leave, douse the fire well, and spread the ashes over a wide area. Return the sand<br>
to the place where you found it and pack up your tarp.<br>
&quot;Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints&quot; is a good summary of the more<br>
common </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Leave No Trace </span><span style="color:#212529;">7 Principles. Memorize and practice these:<br>
1. Plan ahead and prepare.<br>
2. Travel and camp on durable surfaces.<br>
3. Dispose of waste properly.<br>
4. Leave what you find.<br>
5. Minimize campfire impacts (be careful with fire).<br>
6. Respect wildlife.<br>
7. Be considerate of other visitors.<br>

backpacking.<br>
Warm Weather Clothing<br>
Keep in mind that the weather can change suddenly. Just because it is warm when you begin<br>
your outing does not mean it will be warm the whole time. If there is a chance that the<br>
weather will turn cold, take along some cold weather gear as well. Check an almanac to see<br>
how cold it can get during the time you are planning to be out.<br>
Here is a list of clothing appropriate for a warm-weather outing.<br>
Thick socks<br>
Jeans<br>
Light Shirt (short sleeve)<br>
Light Shirt (long sleeve)<br>
Hat with a wide brim<br>
Boots<br>
Cold Weather Clothing Remember to dress in layers. This will allow you to control your<br>
temperature better. In cold weather, you do not want to sweat, because that will soak your<br>
clothing and chill you. If you find yourself working up a sweat, remove a layer of clothing, or<br>
open a zipper. Rely on wool rather than on cotton, because wool stays warm even when wet.<br>
There is a popular saying among experienced outdoorsmen that &quot;Cotton kills.&quot; This is because<br>
when cotton gets wet, it steals the body's heat which can lead to hypothermia and death. Your<br>
outer layer should be wind-proof, as this greatly increases the warmth of your clothing. Here is<br>
a list:<br>
Thermal Underwear<br>
Light shirts (polyester or some other synthetic)<br>
Heavy Shirts<br>
Wool Sweater<br>
Wind Breaker<br>
Fleece Pants (synthetic)<br>
Nylon Pants (as the outside layer) or snow pants<br>
Overcoat<br>
Wool Socks<br>
Boots<br>
Warm Hat<br>
Sleepwear For comfortable sleeping and for modesty on overnight trips, bring pajamas or a<br>
sweat suit. In many places where it is warm during the day it gets cold at night, so be<br>
prepared.<br>
Rain Gear Be ready for bad weather on your backpacking trip by bringing along a poncho and<br>
rain pants. In a pinch, you can use a garbage bag as a raincoat by cutting a hole in th bottom,<br>
turning it over, and poking your head through the hole. A slit along each seam on the side will<br>
make arm holes. It will not cover your head like that, but it will keep the rest of you dry.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Know the principles in selecting a good quality backpack. In an emergency, what<br>
might be used in place of a backpack?<br>
There are a lot of products on the market these days that are called &quot;backpacks,&quot; but don't be<br>
fooled. Some of them are entirely unsuited to backpacking. Most of the cheap ones you will<br>
find in a store are intended for carrying school supplies between the house, school bus, and<br>
classroom. They are not designed to carry all the gear you'll need for an overnight trip over<br>
miles of rough terrain. A backpack suited for backpacking will have a hip strap on it that<br>
fastens around the hips. Most of the weight of the backpack will thus be carried on your hips.<br>
The shoulder straps will carry a small percentage of the weight as well, but they are really<br>
intended to keep the backpack from tipping off. If you find that you are carrying most the<br>
weight on your shoulders, you need to adjust the backpack to shift the weight to your hips.<br>
You will be able to walk much farther distances in greater comfort that way.<br>
Book bags do not come with hip straps. All the weight is thus placed on the shoulders which<br>
is fine for a short trek from the house to the bus stop, but miserable on a 3-mile hike.<br>
                                                      <em>Backpacking </em>backpacks come in two basic designs: the Internal Frame backpack, and the<br>
External Frame backpack.<br>
The external frame backpack (or EF backpack) has a rigid frame made from aluminum,<br>
plastic, or both. The pack itself attaches to the frame, and the frame is attached to the body<br>
via shoulder and hip straps. The frame holds the pack away from the back so that air may<br>
circulate back there, making an EF backpack cooler to carry. The downside to an EF is that the<br>
body tends to twist and flex as a hiker moves, and the frame resists this. Some EF packs take<br>
this into account, and provide a frame that will flex. The main measure of comfort on an EF<br>
backpack is the degree to which it flexes.<br>
The internal frame backpack (IF backpack) drapes over the back. It gets its structure from the<br>
gear placed inside it. This allows the IF backpack to flex and move as the body does, making it<br>
generally more comfortable to carry. Furthermore, the IF pack lies against the hikers back.<br>
This allows it to distribute its weight over a greater area, but it also prevents air circulation,<br>
making it hotter to wear. The IF pack uses foam in the straps to add even more comfort. There<br>
are two basic types of foam: open-cell foam, and closed-cell foam. Open cell foam is highly<br>
compressible. While this may add comfort in some places, it should not be used in the straps.<br>
In the straps, the foam compresses too much, leaving the webbing to dig into the shoulders.<br>
Closed cell foam compresses much less than open-cell foam, and is therefore preferred in the<br>
straps. You can easily tell the difference by squeezing the padding. If it compresses to about a<br>
quarter its original thickness, it is open-cell foam.<br>
Whether you choose an EF or an IF pack, the next thing to consider is the material from which<br>
the pack itself is made. Avoid cotton. It is cheap, but it is also not waterproof. If you set a<br>
cotton pack on the wet ground, you will transfer the moisture from the ground to your gear.<br>
Some packs made of Kevlar are appearing on the market, and those should be avoided as<br>
well. Though Kevlar is renown for its puncture resistance (think bullet-proof vests), it does not<br>
offer much in the way of abrasion resistance. Your pack is far more likely to be subjected to<br>
abrasion than puncture. Nylon is a far better choice than either of these, and of course, it<br>
comes in a variety of configurations. All of them are acceptable, but rip-stop is probably the<br>
best suited to the job.<br>
Look for 8 to 10 stitches per inch in the seams. More than 10 stitches per inch decreases the<br>
strength of the cloth, and with fewer than 8, the thread is being asked to do too much.<br>
In an emergency, you can toss your gear into a blanket, gather the corners, and throw it over<br>
your shoulders. Another option would be to stuff your gear into a closed sleeping bag and<br>
sling <em>that </em>over your shoulders. Either of these solutions are obviously going to be far inferior to<br>
even the least adequate backpack though, so this substitution should be reserved for only<br>
emergencies.<br>

three kinds of each that are available.<br>
Sleeping Bags<br>
Rectangular<br>
The rectangular sleeping bag is probably the most common, and are popular for light use.<br>
They are not suitable for backpacking because they provide the least amount of warmth and<br>
the most amount of weight. As the name implies, they are rectangle-shaped. While this makes<br>
them comfortable and roomy, the wide opening near the top is a major source of heat loss.<br>
Unlike a mummy bag it does not have a hood that can be drawn around the head to retain<br>
heat.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#212529;"><br>
Mummy Bag<br>
The mummy bag is shaped like a sarcophagus. It is narrow at the feet (but tall there to allow<br>
just enough room for the feet), tapers at the waist, widens again at the shoulders, and then<br>
tapers down near the head. The top is very much like the hood of a winter coat, complete with<br>
drawstrings to close up the gap and keep heat in. Because they conform so well to the human<br>
shape, there is very little wasted space inside. This is good because your body has to heat all<br>
that space, and because the extra insulation and material thusly removed does not have to be<br>
carried (meaning it's lighter).<br>
Barrel Bag<br>
The barrel bag is a modified mummy bag. It is roomier than the mummy bag and provides<br>
almost the same warmth at the cost of additional weight.<br>
Sleeping Pads<br>
Sleeping pads can perform two main functions:<br>
1. Provide cushioning<br>
2. Provide insulation between the sleeper and the ground.<br>
Air mattresses<br>
Air mattresses are inflatable cushions that can provide a lot of comfort when it comes to<br>
sleeping on the ground. Unfortunately, they are not very warm as they provide next to no<br>
insulation beneath the sleeper. This may not be an issue, though it is well worth knowing.<br>
Open-cell foam pads<br>
Open-cell foam is a type of foam padding that is sometimes found in furniture cushions or<br>
even in regular mattresses. It is lightweight - though somewhat bulky. Its chief disadvantage is<br>
that it soaks up water like a sponge.<br>
Closed-cell foam pads<br>
Closed-cell foam makes the ideal sleeping pad. The closed cells do not soak up water. They<br>
are lightweight, comfortable, and compact. Often they are only half an inch (12 mm) thick, so<br>
they can be rolled into a small tube and strapped to a backpack. They also serve as an<br>
excellent thermal barrier between the sleeper and the ground.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">6 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Know how to pack a pack properly.<br>
1. Lay out all your gear where you can see it, next to your pack.<br>
2. Look for empty spaces in your gear - for instance, there may be room inside your cooking<br>
pot. Put any small items that will fit inside that to conserve space. Look for other &quot;hidden&quot;<br>
space as well.<br>
3. For an internal frame backpack, put the sleeping bag in first, at the bottom. For an<br>
external frame, tie it underneath the pack.<br>
4. Load the heavy items next, placing them as close to your back as you can. This will shift<br>
the center of gravity forward which will help your balance and improve comfort. Be sure<br>
nothing is going to poke you in the back though.<br>
5. Put the lighter items such as clothing in towards the outside of the pack.<br>
6. Put the things you'll need on the trail (like water, trail mix, compass, map, etc.) in the outer<br>
pockets where you can get to them. If they're hard to get to, you'll be unlikely to use them.<br>
And if you don't use them, why bring them at all?<br>

grocery store.<br>
Although you can buy prepared dehydrated foods for backpacking at an outdoor<br>
outfitter, getting your food this way can be fairly expensive. Instead, try getting<br>
dehydrated food at a regular grocery store. Here's a short list of possibilities:<br>
Instant mashed potatoes<br>
Instant oatmeal<br>
Quick-cooking rice<br>
Powdered milk<br>
Powdered eggs<br>
Pasta<br>
Nuts and peanuts<br>
Dry soup mixes<br>
Dry beans, lentils, peas<br>
Granola<br>
Dried fruits (apricots, apples, and banana chips)<br>
Flour, mixed with other dry ingredients to make pancakes or biscuits<br>

foods for your trip.<br>
Once you've bought the food you plan to eat on your backpacking trip, the last thing you<br>
will want to do is toss it unthoughtfully into your backpack in its original packaging.<br>
Food packaging is designed to catch your eye at the grocery store, and to do this, it<br>
does <em>not </em>come in space-efficient sizes. Empty all of your food and repack it into<br>
sealable plastic bags (such as Ziplock bags). Make up a menu before you do this, and<br>
pack each meal into a separate bag. Then clearly label the bag with a permanent<br>
marker or a mailing label. The label should be legible even in dim light - you never know<br>
when you'll have to cook your food in the dark. This is a lot of trouble to go through, but<br>
it is well worth it during the trip.<br>
If you wish to make pancakes, first determine how many pancake meals your party will<br>
eat, and mix it all up at once. It is a lot easier to accurately measure large amounts of<br>
flour, salt, and baking powder than it is to measure small amounts of the same. Mix it<br>
all together <em>thoroughly</em>, and when it is well mixed, scoop out enough to make one<br>
serving and place it in a baggie. Make as many single-serving baggies of pancake mix<br>
as you'll use. You can use the same technique for making soup mixes and other<br>
delectables. Just keep all the ingredients dry and be prepared to add water at the<br>
campsite.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">7c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Make a trail snack.<br>
There are millions of recipes for trail mix, and every seasoned backpacker has a<br>
favorite. &quot;Gorp&quot; is a perennial favorite - the name tells its ingredients: Good old raisins<br>
and peanuts. Choose half a dozen (or more! or less!) of items such as these, mix them<br>
together, and put them in a baggie:<br>
Raisins<br>
Peanuts<br>
Chex cereal<br>
Frosted Flakes or other sweetened cereal<br>
Pretzels<br>
M &amp; M's<br>
Chocolate chips<br>
Dried fruit<br>
Shelled sunflower seeds<br>
Put the baggie in an easy to reach place in your pack so you can nibble on it while you<br>
hike. Don't worry about getting low-fat items. You'll be doing enough walking (and<br>
carrying a heavy pack) to burn a <em>lot </em>of calories - you'll <em>need </em>the fat.<br>

Sunburn is from over-exposure to the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. While the<br>
symptoms are usually temporary (such as red skin that is painful to the touch), the skin<br>
damage is often permanent and can have serious long-term health effects, including<br>
skin cancer.<br>
There is no such thing as a &quot;healthy tan.&quot; Unprotected sun exposure causes<br>
premature aging of the skin.<br>
Sun exposure can cause first and second degree burns.<br>
Skin cancer usually appears in adulthood, but is caused by sun exposure and<br>
sunburns that began as early as childhood. You can help prevent skin cancer by<br>
protecting your skin and your children's skin from the harmful rays of the sun.<br>
Factors that make sunburn more likely:<br>
Infants and children are especially sensitive to the burning effects of the sun.<br>
People with fair skin are more likely to get sunburn. But even dark and black skin<br>
can burn and should be protected.<br>
The sun's rays are strongest during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The sun's<br>
rays are also stronger at higher altitudes and lower latitudes (closer to the tropics).<br>
Reflection off water, sand, or snow can intensify the sun's burning rays.<br>
Sun lamps can cause severe sunburn.<br>
Some medications (such as the antibiotic doxycycline) can make you more<br>
susceptible to sunburn.<br>
First Aid<br>
Try taking a cool bath or shower. Or place wet, cold wash cloths on the burn for 10<br>
to 15 minutes, several times a day. You can mix baking soda in the water to help<br>
relieve the pain. (Small children may become easily chilled, so keep the water<br>
tepid.)<br>
Apply a soothing lotion to the skin.<br>
Aloe gel is a common household remedy for sunburns. Aloe contains active<br>
compounds that help stop pain and inflammation of the skin.<br>
An over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be<br>
helpful. DO NOT give aspirin to children.<br>
Do Not<br>
DO NOT apply petroleum jelly, benzocaine, lidocaine, or butter to the sunburn. They<br>
make the symptoms worse and can prevent healing.<br>
DO NOT wash burned skin with harsh soap.<br>

Blister Prevention<br>
When it comes to blisters on the feet, it is always best to avoid them. Blisters are<br>
caused when your foot rubs against something repeatedly. Blisters can be avoided by<br>
wearing footwear that fits you correctly. Also, be sure to break your footwear in before<br>
embarking on a long hike. It also helps to wear two pairs of socks. When you do this,<br>
the inner sock moves with your foot and the outer sock moves with your boot. All the<br>
rubbing takes place between the two socks rather than between your foot and the<br>
sock. This will eventually wear a hole in your sock, but replacing socks is a lot less<br>
painful than hiking with a blister.<br>
Blister Treatment<br>
Try not to break the blister open. It is far better if the skin continues to cover the injury,<br>
as this will keep out germs and prevent infection. If you must open the blister in order<br>
to be able to walk, do it as follows.<br>
Clean the affected area<br>
Sterilize a needle<br>
Pierce the blister in several places around its perimeter to drain the fluid, but try to<br>
leave as much of the skin intact as possible.<br>
Wipe the injury down with rubbing alcohol.<br>
Whether you open the blister or not, you should then treat it as follows:<br>
Cut a hole a little larger than the blister in a piece of moleskin from your first aid kit,<br>
and place the hole over the blister. The thickness of the surrounding moleskin<br>
protects the blister from further friction. If you do not have a moleskin, you can do<br>
the same thing with an adhesive bandage.<br>
Cover a large blister with gauze and adhesive tape.<br>
Be sure to allow the blister to breathe.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">8c </span><span style="color:#212529;">Frostbite<br>
Frostbite occurs when ice crystals form in the skin or deeper tissues after exposure to<br>
a temperature of 32°F (0°C) or lower. Depending upon the temperature, altitude, and<br>
wind speed, the exposure time necessary to produce frostbite varies from a few<br>
minutes to several hours.<br>
The areas most commonly affected are the face and extremities. The symptoms of<br>
frostbite are progressive. Victims generally incur this injury without being acutely aware<br>
of it. Initially, the affected skin reddens and there is an uncomfortable coldness. With<br>
continued heat loss, there is a numbness of the affected area due to reduced<br>
circulation. As ice crystals form, the frozen extremity appears white, yellow-white, or<br>
mottled blue-white, and is cold, hard, and insensitive to touch or pressure. Frostbite is<br>
classified as superficial or deep, depending on the extent of tissue involvement.<br>
Superficial Frostbite<br>
In superficial frostbite the surface of the skin will feel hard, but the underlying tissue<br>
will be soft, allowing it to move over bony ridges. This is evidence that only the skin and<br>
the region just below it are involved. General treatment for superficial frostbite is as<br>
follows:<br>
1. Take the victim indoors.<br>
2. Rewarm hands by placing them under the armpits, against the abdomen, or<br>
between the legs.<br>
3. Rewarm feet by placing them in the armpit or against the abdomen of the buddy.<br>
4. Gradually rewarm the affected area by warm water immersion, skin-to-skin contact,<br>
or hot water bottles.<br>
5. Never rub a frostbite area.<br>
Deep Frostbite<br>
In deep frostbite, the freezing reaches into the deep tissue layers. There are ice crystals<br>
in the entire thickness of the extremity. The skin will not move over bony ridges and will<br>
feel hard and solid. The objectives of treatment are to protect the frozen areas from<br>
further injury, to rapidly thaw the affected area, and to be prepared to respond to<br>
circulatory or respiratory difficulties.<br>
1. Carefully assess and treat any other injuries first. Constantly monitor the victim’s<br>
pulse and breathing since respiratory and heart problems can develop rapidly. Be<br>
prepared to administer CPR if necessary.<br>
2. Do not attempt to thaw the frostbitten area if there is a possibility of refreezing. It<br>
is better to leave the part frozen until the victim arrives at a medical treatment<br>
facility equipped for long-term care. Refreezing of a thawed extremity causes<br>
severe and disabling damage.<br>
3. Treat all victims with injuries to the feet or legs as litter patients. When this is not<br>
possible, the victim may walk on the frozen limb, since it has been proven that<br>
walking will not lessen the chances of successful treatment as long as the limb<br>
has not thawed out.<br>
4. When adequate protection from further cold exposure is available, prepare the<br>
victim for rewarming by removing all constricting clothing such as gloves, boots,<br>
and socks. Boots and clothing frozen on the body should be thawed by warmwater immersion before removal.<br>
5. Rapidly rewarm frozen areas by immersion in water at 100°F to 105°F (38°C to<br>
41°C). Keep the water warm by adding fresh hot water, but do not pour the water<br>
directly on the injured area. Ensure that the frozen area is completely surrounded<br>
by water; do not let it rest on the side or bottom of the tub.<br>
6. After rewarming has been completed, pat the area dry with a soft towel. Later it will<br>
swell, sting, and burn. Blisters may develop. These should be protected from<br>
breaking. Avoid pressure, rubbing, or constriction of the injured area. Keep the skin<br>
dry with sterile dressings and place cotton between the toes and fingers to prevent<br>
their sticking together.<br>
7. Protect the tissue from additional injury and keep it as clean as possible (use<br>
sterile dressings and linen).<br>
8. Try to improve the general morale and comfort of the victim by giving hot,<br>
stimulating fluids such as tea or coffee. Do not allow the victim to smoke or use<br>
alcoholic beverages while being treated.<br>
9. Transfer to a medical treatment facility as soon as possible. During transportation,<br>
slightly elevate the frostbitten area and keep the victim and the injured area warm.<br>
Do not allow the injured area to be exposed to the cold.<br>

Hypothermia is caused by continued exposure to low or rapidly falling temperatures,<br>
cold moisture, snow, or ice. Those exposed to low temperatures for extended periods<br>
may suffer ill effects, even if they are well protected by clothing, because cold affects<br>
the body systems slowly, almost without notice. As the body cools, there are several<br>
stages of progressive discomfort and disability. he first symptom is shivering, which is<br>
an attempt to generate heat by repeated contractions of surface muscles. This is<br>
followed by a feeling of listlessness, indifference, and drowsiness. Unconsciousness<br>
can follow quickly. Shock becomes evident as the victim’s eyes assume a glassy stare,<br>
respiration becomes slow and shallow, and the pulse is weak or absent. As the body<br>
temperature drops even lower, peripheral circulation decreases and the extremities<br>
become susceptible to freezing. Finally, death results as the core temperature of the<br>
body approaches 80°F (27°C). The steps for treatment of hypothermia are as follows:<br>
1. Carefully observe respiratory effort and heart beat; CPR may be required while the<br>
warming process is underway.<br>
2. Rewarm the victim as soon as possible. It may be necessary to treat other injuries<br>
before the victim can be moved to a warmer place. Severe bleeding must be<br>
controlled and fractures splinted over clothing before the victim is moved.<br>
3. Replace wet or frozen clothing and remove anything that constricts the victim’s<br>
arms, legs, or fingers, interfering with circulation.<br>
4. If the victim is inside a warm place and is conscious, the most effective method of<br>
warming is immersion in a tub of warm (100° to 105°F or 38° to 41°C) water. The<br>
water should be warm to the elbow - never hot. Observe closely for signs of<br>
respiratory failure and cardiac arrest (rewarming shock). Rewarming shock can be<br>
minimized by warming the body trunk before the limbs to prevent vasodilation in<br>
the extremities with subsequent shock due to blood volume shifts.<br>
5. If a tub is not available, apply external heat to both sides of the victim. Natural body<br>
heat (skin to skin) from two rescuers is the best method. This is called “buddy<br>
warming.” If this is not practical, use hot water bottles or an electric rewarming<br>
blanket. Do not place the blanket or bottles next to bare skin, however, and be<br>
careful to monitor the temperature of the artificial heat source, since the victim is<br>
very susceptible to burn injury. Because the victim is unable to generate adequate<br>
body heat, placement under a blanket or in a sleeping bag is not sufficient<br>
treatment.<br>
6. If the victim is conscious, give warm liquids to drink. Never give alcoholic<br>
beverages or allow the victim to smoke.<br>
7. Dry the victim thoroughly if water is used for rewarming.<br>
8. As soon as possible, transfer the victim to a definitive care facility. Be alert for the<br>
signs of respiratory and cardiac arrest during transfer, and keep the victim warm.<br>

Heat stroke is a less common but far more serious condition than heat exhaustion,<br>
since it carries a 20 percent fatality rate. The main feature of heatstroke is the<br>
extremely high body temperature, 105º F (41º C) or higher, that accompanies it. In<br>
heatstroke, the victim has a breakdown of the sweating mechanism and is unable to<br>
eliminate excessive body heat built up while exercising. If the body temperature rises<br>
too high, the brain, kidneys, and liver may be permanently damaged.<br>
Sometimes the victim may have preliminary symptoms, such as headache, nausea,<br>
dizziness, or weakness. Breathing will be deep and rapid at first, later shallow and<br>
almost absent. Usually the victim will be flushed, very dry, and very hot. The pupils will<br>
be constricted (pinpoint) and the pulse fast and strong.<br>
When you provide first aid for heatstroke, remember that this is a true life-and-death<br>
emergency. The longer the victim remains overheated, the higher the chances of<br>
irreversible body damage or even death occurring. First aid treatment for heatstroke is<br>
designed to reduce body heat. Reduce body heat immediately by dousing the body with<br>
cold water, or applying wet, cold towels to the whole body. Move the victim to the<br>
coolest possible place and remove as much clothing as possible. Maintain an open<br>
airway. Place the victim on his/her back, with the head and shoulders slightly raised. If<br>
cold packs are available, place them under the arms, around the neck, at the ankles,<br>
and in the groin. Expose the victim to a fan or air-conditioner since drafts will promote<br>
cooling. Immersing the victim in a cold water bath is also effective. Give the victim (if<br>
conscious) cool water to drink. Do not give any hot drinks or stimulants. Get the victim<br>
to a medical facility as soon as possible. Cooling measures must be continued while<br>
the victim is being transported.<br>

Heat exhaustion is the most common condition caused by working or exercising in hot<br>
spaces. Heat exhaustion produces a serious disruption of blood flow to the brain,<br>
heart, and lungs. This causes the victim to experience weakness, dizziness, headache,<br>
loss of appetite, and nausea.<br>
Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion are similar to those of shock: the victim will<br>
appear ashen gray; the skin will be cold, moist, and clammy; and the pupils of the eyes<br>
may be dilated (enlarged). The vital (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and<br>
respiration) signs usually are normal; however, the victim may have a weak pulse<br>
together with rapid and shallow breathing.<br>
Body temperature may be below normal. You should treat heat exhaustion victims as if<br>
they were in shock. Loosen the clothing, apply cool wet cloths, move the victim to<br>
either a cool or an air-conditioned area, and fan the victim. Do not allow the person to<br>
become chilled. If the victim is conscious, administer a solution of 1 teaspoon of salt<br>
dissolved in a quart of cool water. If the victim vomits, do not give any more fluids.<br>
Transport the victim to a medical facility as soon as possible.<br>

First aid<br>
Snakebite first aid recommendations vary, in part because different snakes have<br>
different types of venom. Some have little local effect, but life-threatening systemic<br>
effects, in which case containing the venom in the region of the bite by pressure<br>
immobilization is highly desirable. Other venoms instigate localized tissue damage<br>
around the bitten area, and immobilization may increase the severity of the damage in<br>
this area, but also reduce the total area affected; whether this trade-off is desirable<br>
remains a point of controversy.<br>
Because snakes vary from one country to another, first aid methods also vary. As<br>
always, this article is not a legitimate substitute for professional medical advice.<br>
Readers are strongly advised to obtain guidelines from a reputable first aid<br>
organization in their own region, and to be wary of homegrown or anecdotal remedies.<br>
However, most first aid guidelines agree on the following:<br>
1. Protect the patient (and others, including yourself) from further bites. While<br>
identifying the species is desirable in certain regions, do not risk further bites or<br>
delay proper medical treatment by attempting to capture or kill the snake. If the<br>
snake has not already fled, carefully remove the victim from the immediate area. If<br>
possible, take a photograph of the snake (many cell phones are equipped with<br>
cameras). If you do not know what type of snake it is, someone else might be able<br>
to identify it from the photo. A poor photo is better than no photo.<br>
2. Keep the victim calm. Acute stress reaction increases blood flow and endangers<br>
the patient. Keep people near the patient calm. Panic is infectious and<br>
compromises judgment.<br>
3. Call for help to arrange for transport to the nearest hospital emergency room,<br>
where antivenin for snakes common to the area will often be available.<br>
4. Make sure to keep the bitten limb in a functional position and below the victim's<br>
heart level so as to minimize blood returning to the heart and other organs of the<br>
body.<br>
5. Do not give the patient anything to eat or drink. This is especially important with<br>
consumable alcohol, a known vasodilator which will speed up the absorption of<br>
venom. Do not administer stimulants or pain medications to the victim, unless<br>
specifically directed to do so by a physician.<br>
6. Remove any items or clothing which may constrict the bitten limb if it swells (rings,<br>
bracelets, watches, footwear, etc.)<br>
7. Keep the victim as still as possible.<br>
8. Do not incise the bitten site.<br>
Many organizations, including the American Medical Association and American Red<br>
Cross, recommend washing the bite with soap and water. However, do not attempt to<br>
clean the area with any type of chemical. Australian recommendations for snake bite<br>
treatment strongly recommend against cleaning the wound. Traces of venom left on<br>
the skin/bandages from the strike can be used in combination with a snake bite<br>
identification kit to identify the species of snake. This speeds determination of which<br>
antivenin to administer in the emergency room.<br>

Cramps<br>
There are two basic causes of cramping. One is inadequate oxygenation of muscle,<br>
and the other is lack of water or salt. Cramps from poor oxygenation can be improved<br>
by rapid deep breathing, and stretching the muscle. Cramps from lack of salt and water<br>
can be treated by stretching the muscle, drinking water and eating salt. Pounding on<br>
the muscle can increase soreness.<br>
What happens in a cramp is that lactic acid builds up because of normal anaerobic<br>
muscle metabolism. When the muscle burns sugar without enough oxygen, it makes<br>
lactic acid. The lactic acid finally becomes concentrated enough to trigger the<br>
contraction of the muscle. When the muscle lacks salt, the nerves firing the muscle are<br>
unable to recharge properly, causing a similar effect.<br>

Dehydration is the depletion of water from the body. It can be prevented by drinking<br>
plenty of water, especially during periods of physical exertion. One to five percent<br>
dehydration will make you lose your appetite, become sleepy and nauseated, and begin<br>
to vomit. As dehydration goes up to 10 percent, dizziness results. You will have<br>
headaches, difficulty in breathing, tingling of the legs and arms caused by poor<br>
circulation, indistinct speech, and, finally, an inability to walk. Still, 10 percent<br>
dehydration generally causes no permanent ill effects. When dehydration exceeds 10<br>
percent, you will become delirious, spastic, almost deaf, and barely able to see. The<br>
skin shrivels and becomes numb. At temperatures above 90°F, dehydration over 15<br>
percent is generally fatal. At 85° and less, the body can stand up to 25 percent<br>
dehydration. Dehydration is quickly cured by water—in fact, only water can cure it.<br>
When you are dehydrated, you don’t have to worry about how much water you drink or<br>
how quickly you drink it, or if the water is warm or cool. Cold water, though, will upset<br>
the stomach.<br>

Compact, lightweight firsts aid kits are available at many retailers and outdoor outfitters. But<br>
don't just go out, buy one, and toss it in you pack without another thought. It is important for<br>
you to open it up and examine every item. Then review the answers for the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">First Aid </span><span style="color:#212529;">honor, so<br>
that you know how to use each item.<br>

allowed to carry?<br>
An adult should carry no more than a fifth to a third of his or her body weight in a backpack,<br>
depending on the level of fitness. A kid should not carry more than a quarter his body weight.<br>
Your aim should not be to load your pack until you hit the maximum, but rather, to bring as<br>
little as you can get by with. But don't carry anything you aren't going to need. When it comes<br>
to backpacking, less is more! Don't kill yourself. Evaluate every item you put into your<br>
backpack. Little things add up quickly, so try not to duplicate functionality. For instance, if<br>
you're brining a pocket knife, you can probably leave the butter knife behind. Bring a spork<br>
rather than a spoon and a fork. Use parachute cord for a clothesline - it's very strong and can<br>
be used as rope. Distribute &quot;group&quot; gear among the group. Take the tent apart and have one<br>
person carry the fly, another the canopy, and a third the poles. Instead of bringing a pillow,<br>
stuff tomorrow's clothes into a sack and use that.<br>

Northern hemisphere instructions<br>
North Star<br>
In the northern hemisphere on a clear night you can<br>
determine which direction is north by finding Polaris<br>
(the North Star). You can find Polaris by following the<br>
two &quot;pointer stars&quot; in the Big Dipper. Unfortunately, this<br>
method is only effective on clear nights.<br>
Using a Watch<br>
You can use an analog watch to figure out which way<br>
is south during the day. To do this, it is easiest if you<br>
remove the watch from your wrist first. Hold the watch<br>
so that the face is pointing upwards. Then rotate it until the hour hand points to the sun.<br>
You can use a blade of grass to cast a shadow on the watch face to make this easier - just<br>
line the hour hand up with the shadow. Once the hour hand is pointing towards the sun,<br>
you can find south by bisecting the angle between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock<br>
position. In other words, if it is 4:00pm, south will lie in the 2:00 o'clock direction (because<br>
2:00 is halfway between 4:00 and 12:00). At 7:00 am, south will lie in the 9:30 direction<br>
(because 9:30 is halfway between 7:00 and 12:00).<br>
Using a shadow<br>
Find a straight stick at least 12 inches long (30 cm) and drive it into the ground such that it<br>
points directly at the sun. You can tell the stick is pointing directly at the sun because its<br>
shadow will disappear. Then wait until the earth rotates enough so that you can see the<br>
shadow. The shadow will point directly east.<br>
Southern hemisphere instructions<br>
Southern Cross to find south at night<br>
With the lack of a significant pole star in the southern sky (Sigma Octantis is closest to the<br>
pole, but is too faint to be useful for the purpose), two of the stars of Crux (Alpha and Gamma,<br>
Acrux and Gacrux respectively) are commonly used to mark south. Following the line defined<br>
by the two stars for approximately 4.5 times the distance between them leads to a point close<br>
to the Southern Celestial Pole.<br>
Alternatively, if a line is constructed perpendicularly between Alpha Centauri and Beta<br>
Centauri, the point where the above line and this line intersect marks the Southern Celestial<br>
Pole. The two stars are often referred to as the &quot;Pointer Stars&quot; or &quot;White Pointers&quot;, allowing<br>
people to easily find the top of Crux.<br>
The junction of these two lines is the SCP Southern Celestial Pole. If you were at the South<br>
Pole this would be directly above you. This is the point where the night sky revolves around.<br>
Point to this spot then lower your arm to the horizon. Where you are pointing is South.<br>
Watch method<br>
Southern Hemisphere method only. Point the 12 to the sun. Halfway between the hour hand<br>
and the 12 is North. You still have to use your intelligence for this as early morning time and<br>
evening time care must be taken as to which half you use. E.g. 8am sun is rising in the East;<br>
point 12 to the sun North is halfway between the 8 and the 12 at the 10. BUT late evening the<br>
sun is heading to set in the west say time is 8pm you point the 12 at the sun. North is halfway<br>
between the 8 and the 12 at the other side of watch at the 4. This should be used only as a<br>
guide as in some countries the real time has been adjusted and sometimes there is daylight<br>
saving time etc.<br>
Stick method<br>
This method is a waste of time. We all know the sun rises in the East and sets in the West.<br>
The stick shadow shows you this. Also when the sun is at its zenith the highest it gets in the<br>
Southern Hemi look at the sun and it is towards the North the opposite in the Northern Hemi.<br>
So we learn that at mid day is the best time to find North (or South).<br>
But if you must... place a stick in the ground on an open area. Mark the shadows at times<br>
through out the day. From this you can find North or South (depending what side of the<br>
equator you are on) from the shortest shadow and also East and West by drawing a line from<br>
the ends of the longest shadows assuming you had an early morning and late evening<br>
marking with equal time from mid-day. But for this you have to be lucky to have sunshine for<br>
most of the day, which usually is not the case if you are lost. Anyhow it is something to know<br>
if you do not have a watch to know when mid-day is.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">12 </span><span style="color:#212529;">Show the proper way to put on and take off a backpack alone and with a partner.<br>
Alone<br>
Set the backpack on a table (or a large rock), put your arms through the straps (loosened<br>
off), and lift with your legs. You can also set it on a rock or a log and sit down in front of it.<br>
Again, lift with your legs, not with your back. If there is nothing available to set your pack<br>
on; stand with your feet apart, one leg ahead of the other, knee bent enough to set your<br>
pack on it. With shoulder straps loosened off, slip one arm through the shoulder strap,<br>
lean into your pack and slightly downward, and roll it up onto your back. Once in place,<br>
slide your other arm through the shoulder strap. Always tighten your hip belt first, shoulder<br>
straps next and lastly your chest strap. Reverse this procedure for removing your pack.<br>
With a Partner<br>
Have your partner lift your pack and hold it while you slip your arms into the straps. If you<br>
have to stoop, bend your knees. Remember to lift with your legs!<br>

accessible by a vehicle and cook your own meals.<br>
Five miles is a good backpacking trip for a beginner. Find a trail near you by visiting your local<br>
outdoor outfitter. These stores are most often staffed by people who enjoy backpacking and<br>
can provide you with valuable advice on destinations. Once you've got a 5-mile trip under your<br>
belt, why not look at the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Pioneering </span><span style="color:#212529;">honor and make your next trip a 15-miler? If you make it a<br>

Allspice<br>
The fruit of the allspice is more familiar, but the fresh leaves are also used where available:<br>
they are similar in texture to bay leaves and are thus infused during cooking and then<br>
removed before serving.<br>
Arugula<br>
Arugula (also known as Rocket) is generally used in salads but also cooked as a vegetable<br>
with pastas or meats and in coastal Slovenia, it is added in the squeaky cheese burek. It is<br>
often used in pizzas.<br>
Basil<br>
Basil is most commonly recommended to be used fresh, and in cooked recipes, is<br>
generally added at the last moment, as cooking destroys the flavor quickly. It is known as<br>
the King of Herbs.<br>
Bay leaf<br>
Bay leaf is often used to flavor soups, stews, braises and pâtés in Mediterranean Cuisine.<br>
The fresh leaves are very mild and do not develop their full flavor until several weeks after<br>
picking and drying.<br>
Chives<br>
Uses for chives involve shredding its leaves (straws) for use as condiment for fish,<br>
potatoes and soups.<br>
Cicily<br>
Cicily leaves are sometimes used as a herb, with a rather strong taste reminiscent of<br>
anise; it is used mainly in Germany and Scandinavia.<br>
Cilantro<br>
Cilantro is also known as <em>Coriander</em>. The fresh leaves are an essential ingredient in many<br>
Vietnamese foods, Asian chutneys and Mexican salsas and guacamole.<br>
Curry leaves<br>
Curry leaves are commonly used as seasoning in Indian and Sri Lankan cooking, much like<br>
bay leaves and especially in curries with fish or coconut milk.<br>
Dill<br>
Like caraway, its fernlike leaves are aromatic, and are used to flavor many foods, such as<br>
pickled salmon, borscht and other soups and pickles.<br>
Garlic<br>
Garlic is widely used around the world for its pungent flavour, as a seasoning or condiment<br>
or to enhance other flavours. Depending on the form of cooking and the desired result, the<br>
flavor is either mellow or intense. It is often paired with onion, tomato, and/or ginger.<br>
Horseradish<br>
The horseradish root is used as a vegetable or ground in a condiment called prepared<br>
horseradish, and has at times been used as the bitter herbs in the Passover meal in some<br>
Jewish communities. Horseradish, sometimes blended with cream and called horseradish<br>
sauce, is often served with roast or boiled beef, as well as smoked fish. Horseradish is<br>
also used in some prepared mustards. Also, much of what is styled wasabi is, outside of<br>
Japan, actually common horseradish dyed green.<br>
Hyssop<br>

confectionery, chewing gum, and toothpaste.<br>
Raspberry leaves<br>
Leaves of the raspberry cane are used fresh or dried in herbal teas.<br>
Rose hips<br>
Rose hips are commonly used as a herbal tea, often blended with hibiscus and as an oil.<br>
Rosemary<br>
The fresh and dried leaves are used frequently in traditional Mediterranean cuisine as an<br>
herb; they have a bitter, astringent taste, which complements oily foods, such as lamb and<br>
oily fish. They are extensively used in cooking, and when burned gives off a distinct<br>
mustard smell, which can be used to flavor foods while barbequeueing.<br>
Rue<br>
Rue was used extensively in middle eastern cuisine in olden days, but because it is very<br>
bitter, it is usually not suitable for most modern tastes. However, it is still used certain<br>
parts of the world, particularly in northern Africa.<br>
Sage<br>
As an herb, sage is considered to have a slight peppery flavour. In Western cooking, it is<br>
used for flavoring fatty meats (especially as a marinade), cheeses, and some drinks. In<br>
Britain, sage is used with onion for stuffing and also in sauces. In French cuisine, sage is<br>
used for cooking white meat and in vegetable soups. Germans often use it in sausage<br>
dishes. Sage is also common in Italian cooking. In the Balkans and the Middle East, it is<br>
used when roasting mutton.<br>
Saffron<br>
Saffron is characterized by a bitter taste and a hay-like fragrance. It also contains a dye,<br>
crocin, that gives food a rich golden-yellow hue. These traits make saffron a much-sought<br>
ingredient in many foods worldwide.<br>
Sorrel<br>
The leaves may be added to salads to sharpen the taste. They are often puréed in soups<br>
and sauces.<br>
Spearmint<br>
Spearmint is used as a flavoring for toothpaste and confectionery.<br>
Sumac<br>
The hairy covering of the drupes is harvested and used as a spice (a deep red powder with<br>
a sour taste) in some Middle Eastern countries, particularly with salads. In North America,<br>
the smooth sumac and the staghorn sumac, are sometimes used to make a beverage,<br>
termed &quot;sumac-ade&quot; or &quot;Indian lemonade&quot; or &quot;rhus juice&quot;.<br>
Sweet grass<br>
Sweet grass was used in France to flavor candy, soft drinks, and perfumes. In Russia, it<br>
was used to flavor tea.<br>
Tansy<br>
Tansy was formerly used as a flavoring for puddings and omelets, but that is almost<br>
unknown now.<br>
Tarragon<br>
Tarragon is one of the four <em>fines herbes </em>of French cooking, and particularly suitable for fish<br>
and chicken dishes. Tarragon is one of the main components of Bearnaise sauce.<br>
Thyme<br>

Allspice<br>
18th century Russian soldiers would put allspice in their boots. Volatile oils found in the<br>
plant contain eugenol, a weak antimicrobial agent.<br>
Aloe vera<br>
Aloe vera has been used externally to treat various skin conditions such as cuts, burns and<br>
eczema.<br>
Balm of Gilead<br>
Balm of Gilead is a healing compound (a balm) made from the resinous gum of the North<br>
American tree species Populus candicans (Balsam Poplar).<br>
Chamomile<br>
Chamomile is used medicinally against sore stomach, irritable bowel syndrome, and as a<br>
gentle sleep aid. It can be taken as an herbal tea, two teaspoons of dried flower per cup of<br>
tea. For a sore stomach, some recommend taking a cup every morning without food for<br>
two to three months. It is also used as a mouthwash.<br>
Comfrey<br>
This herb contains allantoin, a cell proliferant that speeds up the natural replacement of<br>
body cells. This means that it will promote the swift healing of damaged or injured tissues,<br>
as well as maintaining cell growth and preventing diseases.<br>
Coriander<br>
Coriander has been used for the relief of anxiety. Coriander essential oil showed a delay in<br>
E. Coli growth, suggesting possible agricultural anti-bacterial applications.<br>
Cowslip<br>
Cowslip is used medicinally as a diuretic, an expectorant, and an antispasmodic, as well<br>
as for the treatment of headaches, whooping cough, tremors, and other conditions<br>
Eucalyptus<br>
An essential oil extracted from eucalypt leaves contains compounds that are powerful<br>
natural disinfectants and which can be toxic in large quantities.<br>
Eyebright<br>
Eyebright is used for eyestrain and to relieve inflammation caused by colds, coughs, sinus<br>
infections, and sore throats.<br>
Garlic<br>
Garlic extracts that are left to set overnight are very effective in healing wounds. In 1858,<br>
Louis Pasteur observed garlic's antibacterial activity, and it was used as an antiseptic to<br>
prevent gangrene during World War I and World War II.<br>
Great Mullein<br>
Great mullein is used as an herbal remedy for sore throat, cough and lung diseases.<br>
Licorice<br>
Powdered liquorice root is an effective expectorant, and has been used for this purpose<br>
since ancient times. Modern cough syrups often include liquorice extract as an ingredient.<br>
Additionally, liquorice may be useful for both mouth ulcers and peptic ulcers.<br>
Hyssop<br>
In John 19:29, a sponge soaked in sour wine or vinegar was stuck on a branch of hyssop<br>
and offered to Jesus on the cross just before he died. Hyssop has medicinal properties<br>
which are listed as including expectorant, carminative, relaxes peripheral blood vessels,<br>
promotes sweating, anti-inflammatory, anti-catarrhal, antispasmodic.<br>
Oregano<br>
In the Philippines, oregano is not commonly used for cooking but is rather considered as a<br>
primarily medicinal plant, useful for relieving children's coughs.<br>
Peppermint<br>
Peppermint<br>
It is said that peppermint helps against upset stomachs, inhibits the growth of certain<br>
bacteria, and can help smooth and relax muscles when inhaled or applied to the skin.<br>
Purslane<br>
Purslane is used as a remedy for constipation and inflammation of the urinary system. In<br>
antiquity its healing properties were thought so reliable that Pliny advised wearing the<br>
plant as an amulet to expel all evil.<br>
Raspberry leaves<br>
Raspberry leaves have an astringent flavor and in herbal medicine are reputed to be<br>
effective in regulating menses.<br>
Rosemary<br>
Rosemary has a very old reputation for improving memory, and has been used as a symbol<br>
for remembrance (as in worn during weddings, war commemorations and funerals) in<br>
Europe, probably as a result of this reputation. Students in ancient Greece are reported to<br>
have worn sprigs of rosemary in their hair while studying for exams to improve their<br>
memory, and mourners would throw it into graves as a symbol of remembrance for the<br>
dead. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Ophelia says, &quot;There's rosemary, that's for remembrance&quot;.<br>
Sage<br>
Modern evidence supports the effects of sage as an antihydrotic, antibiotic, antifungal,<br>
astringent, antispasmodic, estrogenic, hypoglycemic, and tonic.<br>
Saffron<br>
Modern medicine has also discovered saffron as having anticarcinogenic (cancersuppressing), anti-mutagenic (mutation-preventing), immunomodulating, and antioxidantlike properties.<br>
Senna<br>
Because of the presence of anthraquinones, senna species are used as the primary<br>
ingredient in certain commercial stimulant laxatives.<br>
Sorrel<br>
Sorrel is used as a laxative.<br>
Spearmint<br>
Recent research has shown that Spearmint tea may be used as a treatment for mild<br>
hirsutism (facial hair) in women. Its anti-androgenic properties reduce the level of free<br>

Tamarind<br>
In the Philippines, the leaves have been traditionally used in herbal tea for reducing<br>
malaria fever. Tamarind is used as a medicine for gastric and/or digestion problems.<br>
Tansy<br>
Bitter tea made with the blossoms of Tansy has been effectively used for centuries as a<br>
drug that expels parasitic worms. Note that only Tanacetum vulgare is used in medicinal<br>
preparations; all species of tansy are toxic, and an overdose can be fatal. As a natural<br>
insect repellent, it was often planted next to kitchen doors to keep ants out.<br>
Yarrow<br>
Yarrow is purported to be a diaphoretic, astringent, tonic, stimulant and mild aromatic. The<br>
plant also has a long history as a powerful 'healing herb' used topically for wounds, cuts<br>
and abrasions.<br>

A herb pillow is very simple to make. Simply make a small bag out of a light fabric<br>
(some people use cheesecloth) and stuff it with herbs of your choice. Lavender, rose<br>
petals, pine needles, mint, and eucalyptus are all popular herbs to use for this.<br>

Jam can be made from rose hips, the fruit of the rose bush. Gather 4 liters of rose<br>
hips after the first frost and remove the black ends. Wash them well to remove any<br>
chemicals with which the roses may have been treated. Boil them in water until they<br>
are soft an mushy, and then press them through a colander to strain out the seeds and<br>
other large pieces.<br>
Continue to cook the pulp that comes through the colander until it is thicker than<br>
cream. Then combine with an equal weight of sugar (800 ml should do) and check<br>
the taste. Continue cooking until the mixture has a jelly-like consistency. Pour into<br>
sterilized jars and seal.<br>

Herbal Soap Making Procedure<br>
Here is a step-by-step procedure that you can follow to make your own herbal soap:<br>
Bring 1/4 cup of water to a boil then add about 2 tablespoons of finely ground<br>
herbs of your choice. Let the mixture steep for about 15 minutes.<br>
Pour in the steeped concoction into your double boiler then reheat.<br>
Add in the soap (make sure it is cut into fine pieces or grated) and let it melt.<br>
p ( p g )<br>
You may add in coloring or essential oils at this point to make your soap more<br>
interesting.<br>
Once fully melted, pour in the mixture into the soap mold and allow to harden at room<br>
temperature. (It will be best to coat your soap mold first with vegetable oil before<br>
pouring in the soap mixture.)<br>
After a few hours, remove the soap from the mold then allow to harden for a day or<br>
two before finally using.<br>
Note though that coloring and essential oils can irritate sensitive skin. Also, it will be<br>
best to use glass or plastic spoons and containers as metals may react with herbal<br>
ingredients.<br>
Making herbal soap is very simple. It only takes a few hours of your time. So why not<br>
give your skin the natural treatment it deserves? Go on and try making your very own<br>
herbal soap today.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Potpourri </span><span style="color:#212529;">is a mixture of dried, naturally fragrant plant material, used to provide a gentle<br>
natural scent in houses. It is usually placed in a decorative wooden bowl, or tied in small bags<br>
made from sheer fabric.<br>
Naturally scented plants used in traditional potpourri include:<br>
Cedar wood shavings<br>
Cypress wood shavings<br>
Incense-cedar wood shavings<br>
Juniper wood shavings<br>
Lavender leaves and flowers<br>
Mignonette leaves and flowers<br>
Pinyon pine cones<br>
Rose flowers, Rose hips, or Rose oil<br>
Cinnamon bark<br>
Marjoram<br>
Much modern potpourri consists of any decoratively shaped dried plant material (not<br>
necessarily from scented plants) with strong synthetic perfumes (and also often strongly<br>
coloured dyes) added, with the scent often bearing no relation to the plant material used.<br>
Sometimes, items which do not originate from plants are mixed in with the potpourri, to give it<br>
bulk and to make it more aesthetically pleasing. It is possible to spray scents onto potpourri,<br>
however a fixative is needed so that the scent is absorbed. Generally, orris root is used for this<br>
purpose.<br>
The word potpourri comes from the French word &quot;pot-pourri,&quot; which was the French name for<br>
a Spanish stew with a wide variety of ingredients called olla podrida. In English, &quot;potpourri&quot; is<br>
often used to refer to any collection of miscellaneous or diverse items.<br>
In ceramics manufacture, a potpourri vase is a vase specifically designed for holding<br>
potpourri. In the traditional designs a potpourri container is provided with a pierced fitted lid,<br>
through which the scent may slowly diffuse.<br>

A </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">pomander</span><span style="color:#212529;">, from </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">French </span><span style="color:#212529;"><em>pomme dambre</em>, i.e. apple of amber, is a ball made of perfumes,<br>
such as </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">ambergris </span><span style="color:#212529;">(whence the name), </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">musk</span><span style="color:#212529;">, or </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">civet</span><span style="color:#212529;">. The pomander was worn or carried in a<br>
vase, also known by the same name, as a protection against </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">infection </span><span style="color:#212529;">in times of pestilence or<br>
merely as a useful article to modify bad smells. The globular cases which contained the<br>
pomanders were hung from a neck-chain or attached to the girdle, and were usually<br>
perforated and made of gold or silver. Sometimes they contained several partitions, in each of<br>
which was placed a different perfume. There is an early Spanish pomander set with </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">emeralds</span><span style="color:#212529;">,<br>
and a fine 16th century one, dredged from the Thames, in the </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">British Museum</span><span style="color:#212529;">.<br>
Today some make pomanders out of oranges studded with whole cloves, following an early<br>
American custom.<br>

The best way to keep these items clean is by cleaning them <em>often</em>. As soon as something is spilled on the stovetop, in the microwave, or in the fridge, it is a <em>lot </em>easier to clean <em>now </em>than it will be later when the spilled item hardens.<br>

the following: basement, closets, cupboards, sinks, floors, and toilets.<br>
Germs and pests love filth, and that is the primary reason for keeping things clean. Germs and pests carry and spread disease, so keeping the house clean will also help keep its occupants healthy.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Basement</strong><br>
Basements should be swept frequently and kept as dry as possible. If the basement is prone to wetness, it should not be carpeted and nothing should be stored on the floor. Rather, everything should be placed on top of pallets or shelves so that the dampness cannot get into the items stored and cause them to mold. A wet basement should be treated for mold and mildew.<br>
If possible, find the source of the wetness and have it repaired.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Closets</strong><br>
Closets should be kept neat and orderly. Closet organizers, shoe racks, and shelves are excellent aids in this endeavor. It's a good idea to air out the closet occasionally, and the floors should be swept or vacuumed whenever the house is cleaned.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Cupboards</strong><br>
Cupboards should be periodically emptied and wiped down. If the shelves are lined with shelf paper, the paper can be changed every now and then to freshen the look of the cupboards.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Sinks</strong><br>
Sinks should be cleaned frequently. This can be done with dish soap and a sponge or a wash cloth. Stainless steel sinks can be scrubbed with steel wool. If the sink has a garbage disposal, the rubber gasket around the drain should be removed and cleaned frequently too (they get pretty gross). Run citrus peels through the disposal to freshen it up.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Floors</strong><br>
Hardwood, tile, or linoleum floors should be swept and mopped. Carpeted floors should be vacuumed frequently and steam cleaned every now and then.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Toilets</strong><br>
Toilets should be scrubbed on the inside with a toilet brush. Especially important is the area just under the rim. A toilet cleaner should be used to do this. The seat, rim, and lid also need to be wiped down with a general-purpose cleaner, as does the outside of the bowl and the tank.<br>

State the order in which silver, glass, table, and kitchen dishes should be washed.<br>
                                                      <br>
Scrape all leftover food into a garbage disposal or into the trash. Dishes with tough, stuck-on food may need to be soaked before it can be cleaned. Oatmeal becomes almost cement-like if it hardens in the bowl or pot, so soaking is almost absolutely a requirement. This is true whether the dish will be hand washed or machine washed.<br>
                                                      <br>
Modern dishwashers do not require that the dish be rinsed before running it through the cycle <br>
- the dishwasher will rinse them at least as well as you will. If washing them by hand, it is a good idea to rinse them off first so that you do not spoil the water. It is difficult to get anything clean with dirty water! Once the dishes are prepared for washing, they should be stacked.<br>
                                                      <br>
Glasses should be washed first, followed by silverware, table dishes, and finally kitchen dishes. In general, the order is to wash the cleanest items first, saving the dirtiest items for last. Glasses are difficult to get clean unless the dishwater is grease-free, so that is the reason they should be done first even if they are more dirty than the silver or table dishes. Keep an eye on the dishwater - if it becomes disgusting, change it!<br>

Rugs</strong><br>
Rugs can be taken outside and shaken out, or even hung over a line and beaten. Keep shaking or beating the rug until dirt stops coming out.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Carpets</strong><br>
Carpets should be vacuumed frequently and steam-cleaned every now and then. If something is spilled on a carpet, it should be cleaned up right away. The best way to do this is by placing an absorbent material (dish towel, wash cloth, or paper towel) over the spill and pressing. As it absorbs the spill, move a dry area of the towel over the spill and continue until it no longer comes up wet. Some spills should be treated with an upholstery/carpet cleaner immediately after this or the carpet will be permanently stained (juices) or bleached (vomit).<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Pillows</strong><br>
Pillows usually have an outer covering that can be removed and machine washed. Let the padded portion of the pillow air out while the cover is laundered. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Upholstered furniture </strong><br>
Furniture upholstered with cloth can (and should) be vacuumed whenever the carpets are vacuumed. Remove the cushions and vacuum the undersides, as well as the portion of the furniture underneath them. They can also be touched up with an upholstery cleaner. Follow the directions on the bottle.<br>
                                                      <br>
Furniture upholstered with leather can be wiped down with a damp cloth, and should be cleaned occasionally with a leather cleaner. Be sure that the leather cleaner you choose is for furniture, or you may end up with stains on your clothing.<br>
                                                      <br>
Papered walls<br>
Papered walls should be cleaned with a slightly dampened cloth. Be careful not to get the paper too wet or it may peel off.<br>
                                                      <br>
Painted walls<br>
Painted walls are more durable than papered walls, so they can be scrubbed down with soapy water. Glossy finishes clean easier than satin or flat finishes, so when choosing a paint, keep that in mind. A bathroom, kitchen, or small child's room might be better served with a glossy finish. A ceiling or master bedroom can be painted with a flat paint (if desired).<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Floors</strong><br>
Hardwood, tile, and linoleum floors should be swept frequently and mopped occasionally.<br>
                                                      <br>
Always sweep right before mopping. To mop a floor, fill a mop bucket half way with warm or hot water, and add a floor cleaner to it. Submerge the mop under the water, pull it up, wring it out, and then pass it over the floor, &quot;painting&quot; the entire surface of the floor. Plan out where you will mop so that you do not have to walk over the damp floor. It is best to do this chore when small children are outside, not home, or asleep, as they sometimes have difficulty understanding that they should not walk on a wet floor.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Windows</strong><br>
Windows should be washed with window cleaner or with a mixture of vinegar and water. Spray the cleaner on the glass, and then wipe it off, being careful to not leave streaks. When washing both sides of the glass, make the last pass horizontally on the inside and vertically on the outside (or vice versa) so that you can tell which side of the glass a streak is on.<br>

This Answer Book cannot know how trash is disposed of in <em>your </em>community. You will need to check with your local government for that information. Waste is most commonly placed in a landfill or incinerated. Some communities require that waste be sorted - yard waste, recyclables, construction waste, household waste, and toxic waste are all treated differently.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#212529;"><br>
The main danger to be concerned with when cleaning out a fireplace is that of starting an accidental fire. Be sure the ash contains no embers by waiting until no fire has been burning for at least 12 hours. Cover the ashes with damp newspaper to keep the dust down, then shovel the ash into a bag, seal and take the bag outside. You may wish to wear a dust mask when doing this, and you may wish to cover the hearth with a tarp to contain the mess. Do not douse a fire in a fireplace with water except in an emergency, as this can cause the firebox to<br>
crack. It will also cause the ash to harden and stick to the brick, making it difficult to clean.<br>
                                                      <br>
Be sure to have the chimney cleaned by a professional annually so that soot and creosote do not build up - this is a fire hazard.<br>

Babies have ways of making their own danger. A house that is &quot;baby safe&quot; has been examined and actions taken to prevent a baby from endangering itself (or others). Unused outlets are covered so that the baby cannot insert paper clips, coins, or other conductive items into them.<br>
                                                      <br>
Cleaners, poisons, and other toxic items are stored out of the baby's reach or locked where they are inaccessible. Stairways are gated so the baby cannot fall down (or climb up and <em>then </em>fall down). Items smaller than a golf ball should also be stored out of a baby's reach, as these are choking hazards. Babies explore the world with their mouths, so they may try to &quot;eat&quot; anything that they can fit into their mouths.<br>

Friends are required to tie and know the practical use of 10 knots<br>
Companions are required to tie and know the practical use of 20 knots<br>
Explorers must earn the Knot Tying Honor<br>
Guides must, under the guidance of an adult staff member, teach the Knot Tying Honor<br>
Master Guides are required to earn or hold the Knot Tying Honor.<br>
An effective way to teach knots in a club setting is to have the staff and the older Pathfinders each teach a single knot to the juniors.<br>

Telling them to &quot;<em>make a bight</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>take the standing part</em>&quot; makes little sense until these terms are understood.<br>

It is mostly used to make ropes and it is one of the most durable of the natural fibers, besides true hemp.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">ii.Sisal<br>

                                                      </strong>The ends of the rope are first wrapped in tape or heated with a flame to prevent each end from fraying completely. The rope is unlayed for a distance equal to three times the diameter for each &quot;tuck&quot;, Wrap the rope at that point to prevent it unwinding further. Form the loop and plait the three ends back against the twist of the rope. Practice is required to keep each end retaining its twist and lie neatly.<br>

                                                      </strong>The rope should be whipped a short distance (One and a half times the diameter) from its end. Lay the head of the twine along the rope, make a bight back along the rope. Begin wrapping the twine around the rope and bight of twine securely. Wrap until the whipping is one and a half times wider than the rope is thick. Slip the working end of the twine through the bight. Cut the twine flush with the edges of the whipping and the rope end not less than half its width from the whipping to give the rope end a finished look<br>

It is tied by unraveling the strands of a twisted rope, knotting the strands together, then laying up the strands together again. <br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>A Matthew Walker knot is tied in a circular bundle of any number of strands. To tie the knot, the tier takes each strand and forms a loop around the rest of the bundle, then passes the end through the newly-formed loop to form an overhand knot. He then moves to the next strand over, moving around the bundle in the direction he passes the loops. Tying the first strand around the bundle is straightforward, but each subsequent end must be passed through the previously-formed loops in order to contain all of the other strands in its loop. When tightening, it may help to roll the knot along the bundle, especially when using only two strands. The final effect is a spiral knot vaguely resembling a section of a barber's pole.<br>

It is particularly appropriate for very heavy rope or cable that is too large and stiff to easily be formed into other common bends. It will not jam even after carrying a significant load or being soaked with water.<br>
                                                      <strong><em></em>WARNING</strong>: The Carrick bend is generally tied in a flat interwoven form shown above. Without additional measures it will capsize (collapse) under load into a secure and stable, although bulky, form. If the knot is allowed to capsize naturally under tension, considerable slippage of line through the knot can occur before tightening. The knot should be upset carefully into the capsized form and worked up tight before actual use.<br>

                                                      </em>Form a bight in the middle of the line, and pull it back over itself like a girth hitch. This forms two loops, turned in opposite directions. Give each loop one more full turn in the direction that will tend to tighten it (the wrong direction will undo the loop completely). Pass both loops over the hook, rail or post and pull tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.<br>
                                                      <em>Method 2<br>
                                                      </em>If working end of the line has an eye in it, and the standing end is accessible, the knot can be tied to a closed ring, another eye, or a rail with inaccessible ends, as follows. Pass the eye around the ring or rail, then pass the standing end through its own eye (this effectively forms a girth hitch). Then pass the standing end through the eye again, and pull up tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.<br>

You can constrict it by tying a constrictor knot around the rope with a bit of twine, or you can tape it. Unravel the end of the rope all the way to the constriction. Bind the ends of the strands with tape to keep them from unraveling. Double one strand (strand A) over itself and lay it between the other two (strands B and C), leaving a loop in its center. Pull strand B over the end of strand A and lay it between strands A and C. Pass strand C through the loop made in strand A. Tighten all three strands carefully.<br>

                                                      </strong>To tie the double sheet bend, start by making a bight in the larger line. Pass the working end of the smaller line up through the bight, around behind the bight, and beneath the loop in the smaller line (that's a sheet bend). Then once again, pass the working end along the same path, around behind the bight and beneath the loop in the smaller line.<br>

It works well for joining thin, stiff, or slippery lines. It requires little dexterity to tie, so is often used in stubborn materials. It is very useful for fishing line--it is less likely to jam a fishing rod than many other bends, and is easier to tie with cold, wet hands.<br>

It appeared on the front page of The Times in 1978 and was credited to Dr. Edward Hunter. Dr. Hunter used it for years to tie broken shoelaces before discovering its originality through a friend in the 1970s. When it appeared on the front page, it led to much publicity for the knot and also to the foundation of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. However, the knot was presented in Knots for Mountaineering by Phil Smith ca. 1956.<br>

Also called a cow hitch, it comprises two half-hitches tied in opposing directions. The cow hitch is often used to connect loop-ended lanyards to handheld electronic equipment, since it can be tied without access to the ends of the fastening loop.<br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>When both the standing parts of the rope are available, the cow hitch can be tied in the following manner: Form a bight and pass it through the ring from the underneath. Pull the head of the bight downwards, and reach through it, grabbing both standing parts of the rope. Pull both standing parts of the rope through the bight.<br>

This knot is used when multiple people are to pull a load. Typically, one end of the rope is tied to a load, and one-man harness knot per puller will be tied along its length. Each loop is then pulled by a different person.<br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>Lay the rope flat. Make a loop in the rope with the running end going beneath the standing part. Pull the running end down so that it crosses over the loop. Pull the bottom of the loop through the gap between the top of the loop and the running end.<br>
                                                      <strong><em></em>WARNING</strong>: The Man harness knot must have the loop loaded or it will slip and contract easily.<br>

Historically, large sacks often contained grains; thus the association of these knots with the miller's trade. Several knots are known interchangably by these three names. Several variations are shown here. This is another depiction of the knot shown above. This knot is also a useful hitch and is known by the name Ground-line hitch when used for that purpose. This variation is noted as having better binding characteristics than the others.<br>

Wrap the running end around the &quot;parcel&quot; and pass it through the top loop of the &quot;eight&quot; following the same path as standing end. Make a loop in the running end and pass the standing end through it. Tighten.<br>

                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>The Prusik is tied by wrapping the prusik loop around the rope a number of times (depending on the materials, but usually 3-5 times), and then back through itself, forming a barrel around the rope, with a tail hanging out the middle. When the tail is weighted the turns tighten around the main rope and grab. When weight is removed the loop can be slid along the rope by placing a hand directly on the barrel and pushing. The trick is, if it grabs well, then it is hard to slide along the rope. Breaking the Prusik free from the rope after it has been weighted can be difficult, and is easiest done by pushing the bow, being the loop of cord which runs from the top wrap, over the knot to the bottom wrap, along the tail a little. This loosens the grip of the hitch and makes movement easier.<br>

When tied properly, it will not come undone, and it is easy to untie. It is very similar to the bowline.<br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>Make a bight at the end of the larger rope (if they are not the same size). Run the end of the smaller rope through the bight, entering from the bottom. Wrap the end of small rope around the back of the large rope, crossing the short end of the large rope first. Tuck the end of the short rope under itself, on top of the bight.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">xxvi.Slip knot<br>

This knot is typically a component of more complicated knots, and is generally not used by itself.<br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>A slip knot can be tied by starting an overhand knot, but instead of passing the running end through the loop, pass a bight through instead.<br>

It does not provide great strength compared to some other knots, but it can be tied relatively quickly and released very easily. These characteristics mean that it is used on square-rigged ships for securing the gaskets that bind stowed sails to the yards.<br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>Begin as for a clove hitch, but instead of passing the end of the line through the loop in the final step, pass a bight instead, leaving the end on the original side. Pulling on this end will release the hitch - if tied in a gasket, this will quickly release the sail.<br>
                                                      <strong><em></em>WARNING</strong>: Never use this knot in a critical situation. It comes untied at the slightest provocation.<br>

It is most commonly used to tie two lines together at the ends. This knot is used at sea in reefing and furling sails. It is used in first aid to tie off a bandage or a sling because the knot lies flat.<br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>Pass left end over and under right end. Curve what is now the left end toward the right and cross what is now the right end over and under the left. Draw up tight by pulling one end and line away from the other end and line.<br>
                                                      <strong><em></em>WARNING</strong>: Do not rely on this knot to hold weight in a life or death situation. It has been known to fail.<br>

It is bulkier and less prone to jamming than the closely related figure-eight knot. This knot is excellent for anchoring a tarp. Pass the end of the rope through a tarp's grommet, tie a stevedore, and anchor the other end with a taut-line hitch. Its added bulk prevents it from pulling through the grommet.<br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>The knot is formed by following the steps to make a figure-eight knot, but the working end makes an additional round turn around the standing part before the end passes back through the initial loop.<br>

Similar to the constrictor knot, it also features an overhand knot under a riding turn. The difference is that the ends emerge at the outside edges, rather than between the turns as for a constrictor. This knot is actually a rearranged double overhand knot and makes up each half of the double fisherman's knot. When tightened, it is very slip-resistant. It is ideal for constructing a pilot ladder (like a rope ladder, but with wooden rungs).<br>

It is useful when the length of a line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension. It is made by tying a Rolling hitch around the standing part after passing around an anchor object. It is typically used for securing tent lines in outdoor activities involving camping, by arborists when climbing trees, for creating adjustable moorings in tidal areas, and to secure loads on vehicles.<br>
                                                      <strong>HOW TO TIE: <br>
                                                      </strong>Pass the working end around the anchor object. Bring it back alongside of the standing part and make a half-hitch around the standing part. Continue with another wrap inside the loop, effectively making a round turn around the standing part. Complete with a half-hitch outside the loop, made in the same direction as the first two wraps, as for a clove hitch. Dress by snugging the hitch firmly around the standing part. Load slowly and adjust as necessary.<br>

                                                      </strong>To make the knot, pass the rope completely around the wood. Pass the running end around the standing part, then through the loop that you have just formed. Make three turns around the loop then pull on the standing part to tighten. Take care that you double the rope back on itself before making the three turns, or it won't hold. Three are recommended for natural rope such as jute, whereas five turns are needed on synthetic rope like nylon. This knot is also known as the Bowyer's Knot as it is used to attach the lower end of the bowstring to the bottom limb on an English Longbow.<br>

Simmering allows the outdoor chef to cook foods longer to soften them without overcooking them and without using excess fuel. On a backpacking trip, this is especially important, as fuel is generally carried in the pack (and more fuel equals more weight).<br>
Tough vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, turnips, and dried vegetables (such as beans and peas) are ideal candidates for simmering. Simply fill a pot with water (about half way), and add the vegetables. When the water begins to bubble, back off the heat (turn down a camp stove, or raise the pot higher over an open fire). Soup mixes are also ideal for simmering.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">b.Boiling<br>

Pasta (spaghetti, macaroni, etc.)<br>
Oatmeal<br>
Boiled eggs<br>
Cooked vegetables (carrots, green beans, corn, etc.)<br>
An easy way to make corn on the cob is by putting the husked ears in a clean cooler, adding enough boiling water to cover it, and then closing the cooler. Let it sit for five or ten minutes. The corn will remain hot enough to prevent bacterial growth for half a day or more.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">c.Frying<br>

Pancakes<br>
Scrambled or fried eggs<br>
French toast<br>
Vegetarian sausages<br>
Veggie burgers<br>
Grilled cheese sandwiches<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">d.Bread on a stick<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">First you will need a bed of coals. If you attempt to bake your bread over a flame, it will be burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Make the bread dough or bring a frozen tube of pre-made dough. Get a straight stick 100-130cm3-4 feet long and clean the end of it off. You can do this by removing the bark or by washing it in clean water. Wrap the dough in a thin layer around the stick, spiralling it as you go. The dough should cover the top 10-15cm4-6 inches of the stick. Once the dough is secured to the stick, jam the other end of the stick into the ground or support it with rocks or large pieces of firewood, so that the bread is held over the coals. The bread dough should be held at a distance from the coals where it is uncomfortably hot to hold your hand. Turn the stick every couple of minutes until the outside is golden brown (this is why you need a straight stick). You can eat the bread right off the stick. This is an excellent early morning activity while everyone is trying to warm up around the fire. It works equally well at night.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">e.Aluminum foil baking<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">There are many foods that can be wrapped in foil and dropped into a bed of coals for cooking, but potatoes spring to mind immediately. Corn on the cob is also very good. Simply wrap them in foil, place them in a bed of coals, and take them out after a while. It's that easy.<br>
A tasty dessert can be made by coring an apple, stuffing it with non-gelatinous marshmallows and a few pieces of cinnamon candy (such as Red Hots), wrapping it all in foil, and placing it in a bed of coals. Take it out after about 15 minutes and check that the marshmallow has melted. If it has, the apple is ready to eat.<br>
You can also wrap vegetarian burger, thin slices of potato, carrot, and other veggies in foil. Add a tablespoon of olive oil, a pinch of salt (if desired), some pepper, and some garlic powder, seal, and place it in the coals. Check it after 30 minutes or so. When the potato is soft, it is ready to eat.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">f.Reflector oven baking<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">A reflector oven is as simple as a cardboard box lined on the inside with aluminum foil. Run wire through the box to create an oven rack. Make sure the rack is horizontal when the box is placed on its side. Put the box next to a bed of hot coals with the opening facing the heat, but not so near as to ignite the box. Put whatever you wish to bake on the rack. Heat from the coals will bake whatever you put inside the box. There are countless variations on this theme, including the practice of completely removing one side of the box and tilting it at a&nbsp;&nbsp; angle. You can prop the box up with rocks or logs, or build legs into it.<br>
You can also construct an oven out of sheet metal, aluminum flashing, or large tin cans as shown below. This tin can oven was constructed by a Pathfinder leader, and tested by Pathfinders in the field.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">2.Know one method of keeping food cool while camping other than with ice<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">The most effective way to keep camp food cool on a campout is by storing it in a cooler with ice. Use blocks of ice rather than ice cubes or crushed ice, as it will remain frozen far longer. Solid blocks of ice should easily last for three days. You can buy it at a store or make it ahead of time by freezing water in plastic gallon or half-gallon jugs. You do not need to remove the ice from the jugs. To extend the life of the ice, make sure the cooler's lid is closed all the way and tight-fitting, and do not leave it open any longer than necessary.<br>
One way to keep food cool without ice while on a camping trip is to place the food in a water-proof container, place that in a mesh bag and secure it in a stream or brook. Another way is to put the food in a bag, cover it with several layers of burlap, wet the burlap, and suspend it from a tree branch. As the water evaporates from the burlap, it will cool the food. You have to re-wet the bag occasionally.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">3.Know ways to keep your food and utensils safe from animals and insects<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">The most important thing you must remember about storing food on a campout is that it should never be stored in a tent where people will sleep. Animals will smell your food, and if it's in your tent, they will find a way in. Instead, store the food outside the tent.<br>
If you have a vehicle available at your campsite, you may store the food inside, but be sure to seal it tightly. A determined bear can get inside a locked vehicle, and if he decides that's what he wants to do, the car will sustain heavy damage. On the other end of the animal spectrum, are mice, which can also enter a locked car - even the trunk. It is therefore important to seal the food tightly so that the aroma does not draw unwanted attention from unwanted visitors.<br>
If you do not have a vehicle or a trailer in which to store your food, you may place it in a bag and suspend it at least 10 feet (3 meters) above the ground by tying the bag to a rope and hanging it over a tree branch. Black bears can and do climb trees, so make sure the bag is well out of their reach - away from the trunk, and at least 4 feet (1.2 m) below the branch from which it is suspended.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">4.Why is it important to keep your cooking and eating utensils clean?<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Make sure you clean your cooking utensils thoroughly as soon as your meal is over. Raccoons will sneak into a camp full of people distracted by tending their campfire and carry away your utensils so they may lick your ladles clean. The only problem is that they almost never return them. Ants and other insects may not abscond with your gear, but you do not want them crawling all over your spatulas either.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">5.Showing knowledge of proper nutrition and food groups, make up a complete and balanced menu for six camping meals. Include the following:<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">A breakfast, lunch, or supper good for a trail hike where light weight is important. The meal should not need cooking but should be nutritious.<br>
The remaining five meals may be made up of any type of food: canned, fresh, frozen, or dried. One of the five must be a one-pot meal.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Proper Nutrition<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">The food groups are defined by the USDA in the food pyramid. The amount of each food group needed by an individual varies by age, sex, and amount of physical activity. The chart below shows the recommended amount of each group for Pathfinder-aged people who are fairly active (and it is safe to assume they will be fairly active on a campout).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Trail Meal<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Sandwiches, trail mix, and fruit are a good combination of foods that do not require cooking. Powdered milk is another option also not requiring cooking, as are any of the weight-loss milkshakes, however you really do want to bring something with a lot of calories. Peanuts and other shelled nuts are also good as they are high in calories (which are needed on a hike).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">One-pot meal<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">A one-pot meal is any meal that can be cooked entirely in one pot. Often, dehydrated foods are used for this, as they are extremely space and weight efficient. You can buy many dehydrated food packages at an outdoor outfitter, but the selection is limited for the observant Adventist. Many of these foods contain unclean meats (Lev 11) or wine, but there are a few that meet Adventist dietary requirements. If one turns from the outfitters and looks in a grocery store, even more choices are available. Many rice mixes are ideal candidates as one-pot meals (red beans and rice, dirty rice, etc.). Soup mixes also work well, as do pastas, macaroni and cheese, etc.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">6.Make up a supply list of items that will be needed to prepare the above six meals<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">The most obvious things on this list will be the ingredients for the meals - but don't stop there! Inexperienced campers have been known to bring canned foods, but no can openers. An industrious individual may find a way to open a can without one, but it is so much easier (and safer) to open a can with the proper tool. You will also need proper cookware for these meals. A pot will certainly be required (for the one-pot meal), but you will also need something to stir and serve the food with, as well as a plate or bowl from which to eat. Don't forget flatware. If you're planning to cook over an open fire, you'll need something to light it with as well as the needed fire safety gear (fire extinguisher, or a bucket to fill with water at the camp site). Otherwise, you will need a camp stove and fuel. Other items may include a cutting board and a sharp kitchen knife, a Dutch oven, pot holders, and a skillet. But don't just blindly pack all of these items - think first. If you will not need a Dutch oven, leave it behind. Imagine yourself going through all the steps to cook the food - with as much detail as you can - and note what items you'll need.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">7.Know how to properly and safely handle food, dispose of trash and garbage, and wash your gear<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Food safety<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">There are two key elements to handling food safely: cleanliness, and freshness. Wash your hands before and during cooking. Be aware of the &quot;danger zone&quot; for food - fresh food above 4C40F and below 60C140F is in danger of spoiling. Keep it in a cooler, make sure the lid stays on, and make sure it stays cold inside. Use fresh foods early in the camp out, and do not rely on a cooler for more than a day and a half. When all the ice in a cooler has melted, the food inside should no longer be used.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Trash disposal<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Try not to make more food than your group will eat. Dispose of any leftover food as required by a campground, or store it in a cooler. Under no circumstances should food be brought into a tent where people intend to sleep. All food needs to be put away as soon as possible and it needs to be kept out of the reach of wild animals. Skunks, raccoons, and bears can be very clever when it comes to getting food. Suspend your food 10 feet above the ground and at least five feet away from a tree trunk.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Wash your gear<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">As soon as the meal is over, wash all the dishes and kitchen utensils. Wild critters will be happy to drag your spatula from your kitchen and lick it clean for you, but they rarely return such items, nor do they clean them satisfactorily.<br>
It is a good idea to number all the plates, forks, bowls, knives, spoons, and cups your group owns, and then keep like-numbered items in a hosiery bag. Each camper is assigned a number, and each camper is responsible to clean his own eating gear. If you find an abandoned bowl on a picnic table, it is a simple matter to check the number, determine the owner, and convince him to do his part. Once the dishes are washed, they are returned to the hosiery bag and hung on a line to dry. It is also a good idea to number the clothespins with which the hosiery bags are hung, and hang them in order. This is not a much trouble is it sounds, and makes finding your own dish set a snap.<br>
Assign a kitchen crew to for each meal and have that crew cook the food and clean the kitchen gear. Optionally, you can use two crews for this, with one doing the cooking, and the other doing the cleaning.<br>

You may wish to have your Pathfinders lay all of them, and then light only one. This allows you to lay all of them in the same place without having to contend with hot coals, or having to tend several fires at once.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Hunter's Fire<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">b.Reflector Fire<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">This fire can be used for baking, though it is not as efficient as a reflector oven (which is has a metallic reflecting surface and often surrounds the item. The fire itself can be of any other form, and is placed in front of the reflector. The item to be baked is placed between the reflector and the fire. This fire is also good for getting oneself warm. The reflector can also be a large rock. If you sit (or sleep) between the reflector and the fire, the side of you facing the fire will be warmed directly, while the reflector throws heat to the opposite side. Very toasty.<br>
If making the reflector from logs, the vertical members should be driven deeply into the ground to support the weight of the horizontal members. You can also use rocks to support them.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">c.Star Fire<br>

As the ends of the logs burn, they are pushed into the fire. The fire is lit at the center of the star. If the logs are propped up on the fire ring, gravity will feed them in as they burn. <br>

It is somewhat difficult to lay however, as getting the logs to balance against one another can be tricky. Sometimes the log pile will topple and upset the kindling and tinder beneath, and you'll have to start again from scratch. If necessary, you can lash them together at the top with twine (but don't use a synthetic rope such as nylon or polypropylene). Once laid, the teepee fire is very easy to light, as convection will take the flames right to the fuel.<br>
Adding fuel to a teepee fire can also be challenging as the balance problem is still there, but it is now complicated by the presence of heat. For this reason, teepee fires often devolve into a chaotic heap.<br>

It is laid very much like a log cabin (hence the name). It is somewhat difficult to light though, as the fuel is off to the side of the tinder and kindling. When it burns, it falls in on itself, confining itself to the fire ring. It is also easy to add more fuel and maintain a neat and orderly fire.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">f.Council Fire<br>

It is very much like the log cabin fire except that more than two logs are laid on each layer. Be careful not to lay the logs too close to one another. Leave gaps of at least one inch (2.5 cm) between each log to allow air to circulate. Like the log cabin fire, the council fire is very stable, and it falls into itself as it burns, remaining within the fire ring. Unlike the log cabin fire, the council fire lights easily as the main fuel is located directly above the kindling and tinder where convection will carry the flames. This fire is hot, and will make a nice bed of coals for cooking. It also uses a lot of fuel. This fire is sometimes called a pyramid fire as well. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">2.Safely make wood shavings or fuzz sticks<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Making a fuzz stick with a pocket knife<br>
A fuzz stick is a small piece of wood which has had slices cut in the sides to create small shavings. Ideally, the shavings should remain attached to the stick, but if they are accidentally removed, they can still be used. Because the shavings are thin, they are easy to ignite. Because they are attached, they in turn ignite the larger host stick.<br>
To make a fuzz stick safely, choose a piece of dry wood, preferably a dry, dead stick from an evergreen tree. The stick should be about the size of a pencil, or perhaps a little larger. Place one end of the stick against a firm surface, such as a log or a rock, hold the upper end with your left hand, and hold the knife in the right. Carefully slice into the stick with a downward, diagonal motion, maintaining even pressure. Stop before the knife reaches the center of the stick. Take another slice a little higher up, and repeat until the stick is covered with the slices of &quot;fuzz.&quot; Turn the stick over and make more shavings on the other side. This is far easier to do with a sharp knife and with a soft wood such a pine, fir, spruce or hemlock. Be sure that you are always slicing away from your fingers. Think at all times about where the knife blade will go if the shaving breaks off, or the knife slips. Make sure that your hand, foot, leg, companions, etc. are not in the path!<br>
Make several fuzz sticks and use them as the first layer of kindling, positioning them atop the tinder. In some cases, the fuzz sticks themselves can be used as tinder.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">3.Show correct techniques for starting a fire<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">A fire needs three things in order to burn: fuel, air, and heat. You need to pay attention to all three for building a successful fire.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Fuel<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Fuel is categorized into three groups: tinder, kindling, and fuel.<br>
Tinder is light, fluffy stuff that is easy to ignite. It may be made of many different types of material, including, dried grass, dead pine needles, fine wood shavings, bird feathers, pocket lint, paper, milkweed seeds etc. The key to tinder is that it should be dry, thin, and wispy. Tinder is laid first, and then it is surrounded with kindling.<br>
Kindling is a bit bigger than tinder. Pencil-sized sticks make excellent kindling, but if all your kindling is that size, you are going to need a lot of it. Sort it by diameter, and stack the smallest stuff over the tinder first, adding progressively larger pieces on top of that. You can arrange it in a tipi, log cabin, or even a ridge-pole and rafter arrangement. As you build up the kindling pile, add larger and larger pieces, but do not add anything with a diameter larger than 1.5 inches through - any bigger than that, and you are into the next size category. Stacking the kindling is perhaps the most important aspect of building a successful fire. If it is stacked too tightly, air cannot circulate and deliver heat from the tinder and it will not ignite. If you do not have enough of it, it will burn out before igniting the main fuel.<br>
Fuel is the largest stuff you're going to burn, though for camping, it should not be larger than six inches in diameter. Any larger than that, and you will either be up all night tending it, or you'll find yourself dousing it before turning in yourself. It is far better to burn all your fuel completely.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Air<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">It might seem that you would need to do nothing to make sure that your fire has a good air supply - after all, air is all around us. But a fire needs lots of air, and the way the fuel is stacked can affect this greatly. Do not pack the fuel tightly. Kindling should be stacked such that the spaces between pieces are equal to the width of the pieces (on average). In other words, the kindling pile should be about 50% air and 50% wood by volume. These gaps will allow the flames to get in between and burn all the kindling, thus igniting the larger fuel logs. When you add logs to the fire, make sure there's at least a one-inch gap between each piece. Otherwise, you will cut off the air supply and the fire will die down without burning all the fuel.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">iii.Heat<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Heat is initially added to the fuel and air with a match, lighter, or other fire lighting device. If using primitive lighting techniques, the tinder is lit first, and then transferred into the kindling pile. Heat is transferred from the match (or spark) to the tinder, and then from the tinder to the kindling, from the kindling to the main fuel, and finally, the heat from the main fuel will be sufficient to maintain the fire, igniting additional fuel (and sometimes drying it out) as it is added. To get a fire to die down, separate the logs so that their heat is spread out. To burn all the fuel, keep pushing the unburnt ends of logs to the center to concentrate the heat (but do maintain some distance between the logs to allow air in).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">4.Start a fire with one match and keep it going for at least ten minutes<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Again, the secret to keeping a fire going after it is lit, is to stack the fuel progressively from smallest to largest. Be sure you have enough tinder to ignite the kindling, and enough kindling to ignite the main fuel. Keep the stack loose enough to allow air to circulate, but tight enough to allow the heat to reach the next layer in the pile. Stack the kindling atop the tinder and have the main fuel ready to go - but do not add it yet. Light the tinder. As soon as you have a good flame, start adding the main fuel to the fire. Add it in an orderly fashion, using one of the techniques detailed in requirement 1 (the council fireworks particularly well for this, as it is easy to lay it and the fuel is positioned directly over the kindling).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">5.Know and practice fire safety rules<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Locate the fire in a safe place. It should be clear for 10 feet (3 meters) all around.<br>
Do not light a fire beneath overhanging branches or tents, shelters etc.<br>
Do not use accelerants, such as lighter fluid, gasoline, kerosene, etc. Learn to light a fire without these.<br>
Put the fire out completely before leaving it. If it's too hot to put your hands in the ashes, it's not sufficiently out. Douse it down with water, turn the coals with a shovel, and be sure to extinguish every coal and ember.<br>
Do not build a fire on top of flammable material such as grass or leaves.<br>
Cut away the sod (keep it moist so it stays alive, and replace it before your leave), and clear away the duff and litter.<br>
Keep fire extinguishing supplies handy and near the fire. A bucket of water or sand, or a fire extinguisher are recommended.<br>
Do not remove burning sticks from a fire.<br>
Watch for embers that escape the fire pit and extinguish them immediately.<br>
Wear proper footwear around a fire.<br>
Be aware that paper, cardboard, and leaves create floating embers that rise out of the fire pit and may land dozens of yards away.<br>
Do not light a fire when conditions are adverse (high winds, or drought conditions) or when fires are prohibited by law.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">6.Show how to correctly and safely cut and split fire wood<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Once you have found a large, dead limb, it is time to cut it loose and drag it to the campsite. You can do this with either an axe, a hatchet, or a saw. Be sure you have firm footing before swinging an axe or a hatchet, and be sure no one is within six feet of you to the sides or to the rear, and within twelve feet of you towards your front. Axe heads have come off before (2 Kings 6:5), and they are very dangerous when they do. For this reason, it may be better to use a saw. A saw will also leave more of the wood intact with the log for burning rather than as wood chips that fly all over the place.<br>
If you need to chop a log in half, do not lay it directly on the ground. Otherwise the axe blows will push the log into the ground. Instead, lay it on another small log (three inches in diameter is good). Strike the log to be cut at the point where it is in contact with the supporting log. Otherwise, the log may flip up and strike you or a bystander. This can cause a serious injury, so be watchful. Again, it is better to use a saw.<br>
Unless the log you wish to split has been sawn and has a flat end, it will be very difficult to split it. Steady it on its end, and make sure it can stand on its own. Instruct everyone to clear away from you, and do not swing the axe if anyone is near. Grip the end of the axe handle with both hands, and gently lay the blade of the axe on the top of the log, on the edge nearest where you are standing. Fully extend your arms when you do this, and back up if necessary. Spread your feet apart by about the same distance as your shoulders are wide, and make sure your footing is firm. If you are right handed, slide your right hand towards the head of the axe as you draw it towards yourself. Take aim, and draw the axe over your head, bringing it down mightily as your right hand slides down the handle. The right hand should meet the left about the same time the axe strikes the log. Note how the axe strikes the wood farther away from you than where you were resting it at the beginning. This is why you should aim for the edge nearest you. If you overshoot the log, you will bring the handle down on the edge of the log and damage the axe. Do that enough, and you'll need to replace the handle.<br>
When splitting a log, try to divide it into two equal masses. If you try to split off a smaller segment, the split will run out, and the piece you remove will be smaller on one end than on the other.<br>
To split a small piece of wood (less than 10 cm4 inches in diameter), place the blade of a hatchet on the end of the log, raise the log and the hatchet together, and bring them down sharply on another log or a rock. When they strike the second log, the hatchet's momentum will drive it into the log. Raise the pair again, and strike repeatedly until the log splits apart. Do not steady the log with one hand and strike it with the other. If you miss the log and hit your hand, you will cause an unnecessary emergency.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">7.Demonstrate ability to start fire on a rainy day or in the snow<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">The hardest problem to overcome when trying to build a fire in wet weather is finding dry fuel. Even in the wettest weather, dry fuel can be found by splitting open a log and taking the wood from the center of it. You can get both your kindling and your fuel from this source. Another place to find dry fuel is on the underside of dead branches - especially those still on a tree.<br>
Before you begin gathering your fuel, you will need to set up a dry place to store it as you collect it. A tarp can be used for this if you lay it out on the ground, place the wood on it, and fold the tarp over it. This will keep the wood off the wet ground and keep rain off it as well. If it is windy, you should place a few rocks on top to hold down the tarp.<br>
Once you have your fuel, you can begin gathering tinder. If you have some with you, you're good to go, but remember, that because your kindling may be slightly wet, you will need more than the usual amount of tinder. If you need to collect it, there are still several options for finding some. Milkweed seed pods are fairly waterproof, and the fibers inside are pretty easy to ignite. Pocket lint is another possibility, but you may have difficulty getting enough of it to light your kindling. You can also make wood shavings from the same wood you're using as kindling. If available, birch bark can be lit even when wet.<br>
Once you have your fuel, kindling, and tinder, you are ready to lay the fire. This is done as with any other fire. You may wish to place a tea candle in the tinder pile as well, as this will help keep things going long enough for the kindling to catch.<br>
Once your fire is lit and the fuel is burning, you can lay wet logs next to the fire to dry them out before trying to use them. The heat from a good hot fire can drive the moisture out of even the wettest logs. You may need to turn them over periodically to dry all sides.<br>
                                                      <br>

If the patient is breathing, do not administer rescue breathing. Rescue breathing is an emergency treatment that may help the victim regain the ability to breathe on his own.<br>
Tilt the victim's head back, and lift their chin (head-tilt chin-lift). The head will not remain in this position by itself, you must maintain the head-tilt chin-lift throughout.<br>
In certain cases, you may not be able to give rescue breaths through the mouth - blow into the nose and seal the mouth instead.<br>
Pinch the victim's nose<br>
Put your mouth on the mouth of the victim, maintaining a good seal, and blow into the mouth. These breaths should be gentle and last no longer than 2 seconds to prevent air from entering the stomach.<br>
When you have given two rescue breaths, begin chest compressions if you are trained to do so. Otherwise, continue with rescue breathing: 2 breaths every 5 seconds.<br>

In the next revision of the first aid honors the first aider needs to know what to do when they come across an accident of any type. They will need to know the correct procedures in their correct order. This is not currently addressed anywhere in any of the Basic, Standard, Advanced First Aid Honors.<br>

It is important to check for breathing in an unresponsive victim. If there is no breathing call or have someone call 911 and then begin CPR. CPR is to maintain the blood flow in place of the beating heart in order to carry the air you are breathing into the victim to the victim's brain.<br>
                                                      <br>
Whenever an accident or emergency occurs and you are the first person to arrive at the scene, there is one important technique to follow first: Check Call Care (see below). Then use DRABC to care for the victim.<br>
                                                      <br>
Oh No! There's been an accident! What do I do first?<br>
                                                      <br>
Check Call Care<br>
                                                      <br>
Check<br>
To Check for danger, you must first survey the scene to ensure your own safety; then, check the victim(s) for responsiveness.<br>
Call<br>
After checking the victim if unresponsive, activate the Emergency Management System, EMS, by calling 911 or your local emergency number, giving them a description of the emergency situation as well as the location of the scene.<br>
Care<br>
After activating EMS, provide appropriate care based on the condition of the victim until advance medical personnel arrives and takes over.<br>
DRABC<br>
                                                      <br>
Danger<br>
Before you try to help the victim, you must determine if the scene is safe. If anything dangerous is present, such as a live wire, a vicious animal, chemical or gas fumes, deep water, or fire, you cannot endanger your own life to try to help the victim. Summon trained medical personnel immediately, and they will handle the situation. If you get hurt at the scene, you end up as just another victim for EMS personal to treat. Once you have called for help, you have done all you can in such a situation.<br>
                                                      <br>
If the scene is safe, try to determine what may have happened or what caused the accident. Never move the victim to give treatment unless immediate life-threatening danger exists, such as a fire or an unstable structure ready to collapse.<br>
                                                      <br>
Response<br>
After determining that the scene is safe, you must check for a response in the victim. You will look, listen and feel to determine if the victim:<br>
                                                      <br>
Is conscious<br>
Has an open, unobstructed airway<br>
Is breathing<br>
Is not bleeding severely<br>
To check for consciousness, tap the victim and shout, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; If the victim can speak or cry, he or she is conscious, breathing, and has a pulse. If the victim is unresponsive, he or she may be unconscious, indicating a possibly life-threatening condition. An unconscious person's tongue relaxes and may fall back to block the airway, stopping breathing and eventually the heartbeat.<br>
                                                      <br>
Next, if the victim is unconscious, roll the victim onto their back, kneel next to the victim's head.<br>
                                                      <br>
Airway<br>
To open the airway of an unconscious victim, tilt the head back and lift the chin, and quickly check for Breathing and Severe Bleeding.<br>
                                                      <br>
Breathing<br>
To check for breathing, you must look, listen and feel. Place your face above the victim's mouth and nose, so that you can listen and feel for air being exhaled while watching the victim's chest for a gentle rise and fall that occurs when breathing for no longer than 10 seconds. If the victim is not breathing begin CPR.<br>
                                                      <br>
Circulation<br>
Check the body for signs of any severe external bleeding (bleeding is severe when blood spurts from a wound, or pooling blood is seen flowing around a persons wound and it is life-threatening).<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">3.Choking<br>

Coughing is the body's natural defense against choking, and it is generally very effective. If the victim is coughing, do not interfere. If the victim stops coughing (or was never coughing in the first place), ask her &quot;are you choking?&quot; If the victim indicates that she is choking, tell her you are going to help her. To do this, you will need to perform the Heimlich Maneuver.<br>
Briefly, a person performing the Heimlich Maneuver uses their hands to exert pressure on the bottom of the diaphragm. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea, hopefully expelling it. This amounts to an artificial cough. (The victim of an obstructed airway, having lost the ability to draw air into the lungs, has lost the ability to cough on their own.)<br>
Even when performed correctly, the Heimlich Maneuver can injure the person it is performed on. The Heimlich Maneuver should never be performed on someone who can still cough, breathe, or speak. It should not be demonstrated or practiced on a healthy, non-choking person.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">4.Bleeding<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">If you see a person who is bleeding heavily, you can do the following:<br>
Press hard onto the wound to stop the bleeding.<br>
If an arm or leg is cut, elevate the limb.<br>
Cover with a clean pad and apply a bandage.<br>
Check that the bleeding has stopped. If it has not, add another pad, and bandage, do not remove previous bandage.<br>
If you have bandaged a limb, check frequently that the fingers and toes remain warm. If fingers and toes are getting cold, loosen the bandage to let the blood circulate.<br>
For severe bleeding (5 cups of blood or more), get the person to a hospital for stitches (and possibly immunization against Tetanus) keeping the limb raised.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">5.Pressure points<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">The usual way to control bleeding is to put pressure directly onto the wound, either with the hand directly or with a dressing of some sort (bandage, handkerchief, tea towel etc.). Do not forget that any wound which is not controlled within a minute or two is a medical emergency; and any deep or large wound must receive medical attention as soon as possible.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F4D78;">Pressure Points<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">It is sometimes not possible to press directly on a wound: for example, there may be a foreign object inside the wound, or a broken bone protruding outside, or the wound may be too large or be inaccessible (e.g. if the limb is trapped by some immovable object). In this case, the only way to control the bleeding is to compress blood vessels over particular pressure points (usually where arteries cross over bones near to the surface of the skin). This technique can be used to control external bleeding from arm wounds and leg wounds.<br>
The correct point is determined by finding a pulse on a victim similar to that felt in the wrist when taking one's own pulse. This point could be located in the wrist, the arm (on the soft underside of the elbow), the groin, or behind the knee. This is the position where a rhythmical pulsation can be felt. Pressure can then be applied over this point -- the artery -- to control bleeding.<br>
Once an artery is compressed over a pressure point, it must not be compressed for more than 10 minutes: any longer in one go can cause irreversible damage to the limb. Typically pressure would be applied for 10 minutes, then released for a couple, then reapplied and so on.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">6.Poisoning<br>

Only induce vomiting if a poison center worker or a doctor advises you to do so. If the poison is on the skin or clothes, remove the clothing and wash with a large amount of water. If poison gets in the eyes, flush the eyes with clean water for 10 minutes.<br>
Get the victim to a hospital as soon as possible, and if possible, bring the poison container with you.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2E74B5;">7.Splinting various broken bones in the body<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Splints<br>
An essential part of the first-aid treatment is immobilizing the injured part with splints so that the sharp ends of broken bones wont move around and cause further damage to nerves, blood vessels, or vital organs. Splints are also used to immobilize severely injured joints or muscles and to prevent the enlargement of extensive wounds.<br>
Before you can use a splint, you need to have a general understanding of the use of splints. In an emergency, almost any firm object or material can be used as a splint. Such things as umbrellas, canes, tent pegs, sticks, oars, paddles, spars, wire, leather, boards, pillows, heavy clothing, corrugated cardboard, and folded newspapers can be used as splints. A fractured leg may sometimes be splinted by fastening it securely to the uninjured leg. Splints, whether ready-made or improvised, must meet the following requirements:<br>
Be light in weight, but still be strong and fairly rigid.<br>
Be long enough to reach the joints above and below the fracture.<br>
Be wide enough so the bandages used to hold them in place wont pinch the injured part.<br>
Be well padded on the sides that touch the body. If theyre not properly padded, they wont fit well and wont adequately immobilize the injured part.<br>
To improvise the padding for a splint, use articles of clothing, bandages, cotton, blankets, or any other soft material.<br>
If the victim is wearing heavy clothes, apply the splint on the outside, allowing the clothing to serve as at least part of the required padding.<br>
Although splints should be applied snugly, never apply them tight enough to interfere with the circulation of the blood. When applying splints to an arm or a leg, try to leave the fingers or toes exposed. If the tips of the fingers or toes become blue or cold, you will know that the splints or bandages are too tight. You should examine a splinted part approximately every half-hour, and loosen the fastenings if circulation appears to be cut off. Remember that any injured part is likely to swell, and splints or bandages that are all right when applied may be too tight later.<br>
To secure the limb to the splint, belts, neckerchiefs, rope, or any suitable material may be used. If possible, tie the limb at two places above and two places below the break. Leave the treatment of other types of fractures, such as jaw, ribs, and spine, to medical personnel. Never try to move a person who might have a fractured spine or neck. Moving such a person could cause permanent paralysis. Dont attempt to reset bones.<br>
Forearm<br>
Forearm splint.jpg<br>
There are two long bones in the forearm, the radius and the ulna. When both are broken, the arm usually appears to be deformed. When only one is broken, the other acts as a splint and the arm retains a more or less natural appearance. Any fracture of the forearm is likely to result in pain, tenderness, inability to use the forearm, and a kind of wobbly motion at the point of injury. If the fracture is open, a bone will show through. If the fracture is open, stop the bleeding and treat the wound. Apply a sterile dressing over the wound. Carefully straighten the forearm. (Remember that rough handling of a closed fracture may turn it into an open fracture.) Apply two well-padded splints to the forearm, one on the top and one on the bottom. Be sure that the splints are long enough to extend from the elbow to the wrist. Use bandages to hold the splints in place. Put the forearm across the chest. The palm of the hand should be turned in, with the thumb pointing upward. Support the forearm in this position by means of a wide sling and a cravat bandage (see illustration). The hand should be raised about 4 inches above the level of the elbow. Treat the victim for shock and evacuate as soon as possible.<br>
Upper Arm<br>
Upper arm splint.jpg<br>
The signs of fracture of the upper arm include pain, tenderness, swelling, and a wobbly motion at the point of fracture. If the fracture is near the elbow, the arm is likely to be straight with no bend at the elbow. If the fracture is open, stop the bleeding and treat the wound before attempting to treat the fracture.<br>
NOTE<br>
Treatment of the fracture depends partly upon the location of the break.<br>
If the fracture is in the upper part of the arm near the shoulder, place a pad or folded towel in the armpit, bandage the arm securely to the body, and support the forearm in a narrow sling.<br>
                                                      <br>
If the fracture is in the middle of the upper arm, you can use one well-padded splint on the outside of the arm. The splint should extend from the shoulder to the elbow. Fasten the splinted arm firmly to the body and support the forearm in a narrow sling, as illustrated.<br>
                                                      <br>
Another way of treating a fracture in the middle of the upper arm is to fasten two wide splints (or four narrow ones) about the arm and then support the forearm in a narrow sling. If you use a splint between the arm and the body, be very careful that it does not extend too far up into the armpit; a splint in this position can cause a dangerous compression of the blood vessels and nerves and may be extremely painful to the victim. If the fracture is at or near the elbow, the arm may be either bent or straight. No matter in what position you find the arm, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OR MOVE IT IN ANY WAY. Splint the arm as carefully as possible in the position in which you find it. This will prevent further nerve and blood vessel damage. The only exception to this is if there is no pulse on the other side of the fracture (relative to the heart), in which case gentle traction is applied and then the arm is splinted. Treat the victim for shock and get him under the care of a medical professional as soon as possible.<br>
Kneecap<br>
Kneecap splint.jpg<br>
Carefully straighten the injured limb. Immobilize the fracture by placing a padded board under the injured limb. The board should be at least 4 inches wide and should reach from the buttock to the heel. Place extra padding under the knee and just above the heel, as shown in the illustration. Use strips of bandage to fasten the leg to the board in four places: (1) just below the knee; (2) just above the knee; (3) at the ankle; and (4) at the thigh. DO NOT COVER THE KNEE ITSELF. Swelling is likely to occur very rapidly, and any bandage or tie fastened over the knee would quickly become too tight. Treat the victim for shock and evacuate as soon as possible.<br>
Ankle<br>
Ankle bandage.svg<br>
The figure-eight bandage is used for dressings of the ankle, as well as for supporting a sprain. While keeping the foot at a right angle, start a 3-inch bandage around the instep for several turns to anchor it. Carry the bandage upward over the instep and around behind the ankle, forward, and again across the instep and down under the arch, thus completing one figure-eight. Continue the figure-eight turns, overlapping one-third to one-half the width of the bandage and with an occasional turn around the ankle, until the compress is secured or until adequate support is obtained.<br>

Burns should be immediately immersed in cold running water, or shower for large area. Do not wait to remove clothes. This should be maintained for at least 10-15 minutes.<br>
                                                      <br>
Continue for at least 1 hour with cold pack, partially insulated with clean fabric (cotton, thin toweling), or further immersion in iced water. Blistered or open burn wounds should be cleaned and covered with non-adhesive gauze (preferably bactericidal) and cotton dressing. DO NOT use butter, oils or any similar treatment which can trap heat and increase risk of infection. Also do not use antiseptics that may aggravate sensitive skin.<br>
                                                      <br>
Consult a medical physician immediately for any large, deep, infected or otherwise serious burn.<br>
                                                      <br>
Aloe vera extract, silverdene (Silver sulfadiazine), topical analgaesics and NSAID are commonly used medications. Consult a doctor before use.<br>
                                                      <br>
Burns are sustained by electricity, heat , chemical or radiation (sunburn). There are three levels of burns, including first degree burns (Superficial burn), second degree burns (Partial thickness burn) and third degree burns (Full thickness burn). The first degree burn is typical sunburn with symptoms such as redness of the skin and pain. Second degree often has blisters and severe pain. Third degree can be caused by fires and caustic chemicals. Often the victim will feel no pain because the nerves have been destroyed, even though the skin is deeply charred.<br>
                                                      <br>
Burns that cover more than ten percent of the body, or are larger than the casualty's palm, are medical emergencies and need to be treated as such. Also ANY burns to the face, hands or groin should be considered critical and require an examination by a physician.<br>

1. For wet chemicals, immediately flush the area with large amounts of water, using a shower or hose, if available. Do not apply water too forcefully. Continue to flood the area while the clothing, including shoes and socks, is being removed. Continue to flush with running water for at least 20 minutes.<br>
                                                      <br>
For dry chemicals, brush off the chemical, then flush with water as above.<br>
For acid burns caused by phenol (carbolic acid), wash the affected area with alcohol because phenol is not water soluble; then wash with water. If alcohol is not available, flushing with water is better than no treatment at all.<br>

It gives no warning of its presence since it is completely odorless and tasteless. The victim may lose consciousness and suffer respiratory distress with no warning other than slight dizziness, weakness, and headache. The lips and skin of a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning are characteristically cherry red. Death may occur within a few minutes.<br>
                                                      <br>
The first stage of treatment for an inhalation poisoning is to remove the victim from the toxic atmosphere immediately. WARNING: Never try to remove a victim from the toxic environment if you do not have the proper protective mask or breathing apparatus or if you are not trained in its use. Too often, well intentioned rescuers become victims. When in doubt, call for trained personnel. If help is not immediately available, and if you know you can reach and rescue the victim, take a deep breath, hold it, enter the area, and pull the victim out. If the victim is not breathing, begin CPR. Get the victim to a hospital as soon as possible.<br>

Head wounds must be treated with particular care, since there is always the possibility of brain damage. The general treatment for head wounds is the same as that for other fresh wounds. However, certain special precautions must be observed if you are giving first aid to a person who has suffered a head wound.<br>
                                                      <br>
NEVER GIVE ANY MEDICINE.<br>
Keep the victim lying flat, with the head at the level of the body. Do not raise the feet if the face is flushed. If the victim is having trouble breathing, you may raise the head slightly.<br>
If the wound is at the back of the head, turn the victim on his or her side.<br>
Watch closely for vomiting and position the head to avoid getting vomit or saliva into the lungs.<br>
Do not use direct pressure to control bleeding if the skull is depressed or obviously fractured.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Internal soft-tissue injuries may result from deep wounds, blunt trauma, blast exposure, crushing accidents, bone fracture, poison, or sickness. They may range in seriousness from a simple bruise to life-threatening hemorrhage and shock.<br>
Visible indications of internal soft-tissue injury include the following:<br>
Vomiting or coughing up bright red blood.<br>
Excretion of tarry black stools.<br>
Excretion of bright red blood from the rectum.<br>
Passing of blood in the urine.<br>
Nonmenstrual vaginal bleeding.<br>
Nosebleed.<br>
Pooling of the blood near the skin surface.<br>
More often than not, however, there will be no visible signs of injury, and you will have to infer the probability of internal soft-tissue injury from other symptoms such as the following:<br>
Pale, moist, clammy skin.<br>
Subnormal temperature.<br>
Rapid, feeble pulse.<br>
Falling blood pressure.<br>
Tinnitus (ringing in the ears).<br>
Fainting.<br>
Dehydration and thirst.<br>
Yawning and air hunger.<br>
First aids goal must be to obtain the greatest benefit from the victims remaining blood supply. The following steps should be taken:<br>
Treat for shock.<br>
Keep the victim warm and at rest.<br>
DO NOT give the victim anything to drink<br>
Splint injured extremities.<br>
Apply cold compresses (ice packs) to identifiable injured areas.<br>
Transport the victim to a medical treatment facility as soon as possible.<br>

Heart Attack<br>
A heart attack is when blood supply to part of the heart is interrupted causing heart tissue to die. Symptoms of a heart attack include severe chest pain, looking pale, sweating, and feeling sick. A heart attack is a medical emergency, and it is a leading cause of death for both men and women.<br>
                                                      <br>
First aid includes the following:<br>
                                                      <br>
Seek emergency medical assistance immediately.<br>
Help the patient to rest in a position which minimizes breathing difficulties. A half-sitting position with knees bent is often recommended.<br>
Give access to more oxygen, e.g. by opening the window and widening the collar for easier breathing; but keep the patient warm, e.g. by a blanket or a jacket<br>
Give aspirin, if the patient is not allergic to aspirin. Aspirin inhibits formation of further blood clots.<br>
Non-coated or soluble preparations are preferred. These should be chewed or dissolved, respectively, to facilitate quicker absorption. If the patient cannot swallow, the aspirin can be placed under the tongue.<br>
U.S. guidelines recommend a dose of 160&nbsp; 325 mg.<br>
Australian guidelines recommend a dose of 150&nbsp; 300 mg.<br>
If it has been prescribed for the patient, give nitroglycerin tablets under the tongue.<br>
Monitor pulse, breathing, level of consciousness and, if possible, the blood pressure of the patient continually.<br>
Administer CPR if the victim is unconscious and non-breathing.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
Stroke<br>
A stroke is caused by an interruption of the arterial blood supply to a portion of the brain. This interruption may be caused by hardening of the arteries or by a clot forming in the brain. Tissue damage and loss of function result. Onset of a stroke is sudden, with little or no warning. The first signs include weakness or paralysis, especially on one side of the body. Muscles of the face may be particularly affected. The victims level of consciousness varies from alert to unresponsive. Difficulty speaking or understanding language; dizziness; sudden, severe headache; distorted, dim or patchy vision are all symptoms of stroke.<br>
                                                      <br>
If the victim has sudden onset of any 2 or more of these signs and symptoms, call an ambulance immediately. First aid for a stroke is mainly supportive. Special attention must be paid to the victims airway, since he may not be able to keep it clear.<br>
                                                      <br>
Call an ambulance<br>
Place the victim in on their side, with the affected side down<br>
Act in a calm, reassuring manner, and keep any onlookers quiet since the victim may be able to hear what is going on.<br>
Carefully monitor the victims vital signs and keep a log. Pay special attention to respirations, and pulse strength and rate (take the pulse in the neck).<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
Epilepsy<br>
Epilepsy, also known as seizures or fits, is a condition characterized by an abnormal focus of activity in the brain that produces severe motor responses or changes in consciousness. Fortunately, epilepsy can often be controlled by medications. Grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizure is the more serious type of seizure. Grand mal seizures may be - but are not always - preceded by an aura. The victim soon comes to recognize these auras, which allows him time to lie down and prepare for the seizures onset. A burst of nerve impulses from the brain causes unconsciousness and generalized muscular contractions, often with loss of bladder and bowel control. The primary dangers in a grand mal seizure are injuries resulting from falls and the convulsions as well as a cessation of breathing. A period of unconsciousness or mental confusion follows this type of seizure. When full consciousness returns, the victim will have little or no recollection of the seizure.<br>
                                                      <br>
First aid is aimed at preventing the patient from injuring himself or herself. Nothing should be placed between the patients teeth for any reason. Never try to restrain a victim during convulsions; however, do not leave them alone.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
Simple Fainting<br>
Fainting is a self-correcting, temporary form of shock. It often is the result of a temporary gravitational pooling of the blood as a person stands up. As the person falls, blood again rushes to the head, and the problem is solved. Usually, the serious problems related to fainting are injuries that occur when falling down from the temporary loss of consciousness. Fainting may be caused by stressful situations.<br>
                                                      <br>
If a person faints (is feels he is about to faint) do the following:<br>
                                                      <br>
Lay victim down<br>
Elevate feet<br>
Loosen tight clothing<br>
Maintain an open airway<br>

Although infection may occur in any wound, it is a particular danger in wounds that do not bleed freely; in wounds in which torn tissue or skin falls back into place and prevents the entrance of air; and in wounds that involve the crushing of tissues. Incisions, in which there is a free flow of blood and relatively little crushing of tissues, are the least likely to become infected.<br>
                                                      <br>
There are two types of bacteria commonly causing infection in woundsaerobic and anaerobic. The former bacteria live and multiply in the presence of air or free oxygen, while the latter are bacteria that live and multiply only in the absence of air.<br>
                                                      <br>
The principal aerobic bacteria that cause infection, inflammation, and blood poisoning are streptococci and staphylococci, some varieties of which destroy red blood cells. The staphylococci and streptococci may be introduced at the time of infliction, or they may be introduced to the wound later, at the time of first aid treatment or in the hospital if nonsterile instruments or dressings are employed.<br>
                                                      <br>
Wash minor wounds immediately with soap and clean water; then dry and paint them with a mild, nonirritating antiseptic. Apply a dressing if necessary. In the first aid environment, do not attempt to wash or clean a large wound, and do not apply an antiseptic to it since it must be cleaned thoroughly at a medical treatment facility. Simply protect it with a large compress or dressing and transport the victim to a medical treatment facility. After an initial soap and water cleanup, puncture wounds must also be directed to a medical treatment facility for evaluation.<br>

First aid<br>
Snakebite first aid recommendations vary, in part because different snakes have different types of venom. Some have little local effect, but life-threatening systemic effects, in which case containing the venom in the region of the bite by pressure immobilization is highly desirable. Other venoms instigate localized tissue damage around the bitten area, and immobilization may increase the severity of the damage in this area, but also reduce the total area affected; whether this trade-off is desirable remains a point of controversy.<br>
                                                      <br>
Because snakes vary from one country to another, first aid methods also vary. As always, this article is not a legitimate substitute for professional medical advice. Readers are strongly advised to obtain guidelines from a reputable first aid organization in their own region, and to be wary of homegrown or anecdotal remedies.<br>
                                                      <br>
However, most first aid guidelines agree on the following:<br>
                                                      <br>
Protect the patient (and others, including yourself) from further bites. While identifying the species is desirable in certain regions, do not risk further bites or delay proper medical treatment by attempting to capture or kill the snake. If the snake has not already fled, carefully remove the victim from the immediate area. If possible, take a photograph of the snake (many cell phones are equipped with cameras). If you do not know what type of snake it is, someone else might be able to identify it from the photo. A poor photo is better than no photo.<br>
Keep the victim calm. Acute stress reaction increases blood flow and endangers the patient. Keep people near the patient calm. Panic is infectious and compromises judgment.<br>
Call for help to arrange for transport to the nearest hospital emergency room, where antivenin for snakes common to the area will often be available.<br>
Make sure to keep the bitten limb in a functional position and below the victim's heart level so as to minimize blood returning to the heart and other organs of the body.<br>
Do not give the patient anything to eat or drink. This is especially important with consumable alcohol, a known vasodilator which will speed up the absorption of venom. Do not administer stimulants or pain medications to the victim, unless specifically directed to do so by a physician.<br>
Remove any items or clothing which may constrict the bitten limb if it swells (rings, bracelets, watches, footwear, etc.)<br>
Keep the victim as still as possible.<br>
Do not incise the bitten site.<br>
Many organizations, including the American Medical Association and American Red Cross, recommend washing the bite with soap and water. However, do not attempt to clean the area with any type of chemical. Australian recommendations for snake bite treatment strongly recommend against cleaning the wound. Traces of venom left on the skin/bandages from the strike can be used in combination with a snake bite identification kit to identify the species of snake. This speeds determination of which antivenin to administer in the emergency room.[1]<br>

A special kind of infection that must be guarded against in case of animal bites is rabies (sometimes called hydrophobia). This disease is caused by a virus that is present in the saliva of infected animals. The disease occurs most commonly in wild animals, but it has been found in domestic animals and household pets. In fact, it is probable that all mammals are susceptible to it. The virus that causes rabies is ordinarily transmitted by a bite, but it can be transmitted by the saliva of an infected animal coming in contact with a fresh wound or with the thin mucous membrane of the lips or nose. The virus does not penetrate normal unbroken skin. If the skin is broken, DO NOT attempt wound closure.<br>
                                                      <br>
If rabies develops in man, it is usually fatal. A preventive treatment is available and it is very effective, but only if it is started shortly after t<br>

When purchasing tents, buy ones in muted colors that will blend in with the environment. Blues, greens, and browns are preferred to reds and oranges. People go camping to escape the garishness of the city—leave that behind.<br>
Also be mindful of the noise level made in your camp. Don't be a nuisance. If camping in the wilderness, be sure to make your camp out of sight of the trail. Most National Forests have guidelines for where you can camp in relation to the trail. Find out what those guidelines are and follow them.<br>
Do not enter anyone else's camp site without their permission, especially when traveling to or from your campsite to other places on the campground. It is very rude to cut through another camp. Use the road or trail, even if it will take longer.<br>
Leave the area cleaner than you found it. If you are leading a group of youngsters on a campout, have a contest before you pile back in your cars to go home: see who can collect the most litter (define &quot;most&quot; first though - it can mean by volume, by weight, or by item count). Offer a prize to the one who collects the most (such as getting to choose which seat he or she will sit in on the trip home).<br>
Memorize the 7 Leave No Trace Principles:<br>
 Plan ahead and prepare.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Travel and camp on durable surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Dispose of waste properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Leave what you find.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Minimize campfire impacts (be careful with fire).<br>
 Respect wildlife.&nbsp; <br>
 Be considerate of other visitors.<br>
Note: If you ever plan to go camping in a location that allows hunting- such as a national forest, bright colors is an important safety consideration. Camouflaged or dark color tents will not aid hunters in quickly identifying that there are people in the area.<br>

The best advice about being lost, is DON'T! And the best way to keep from getting lost is to stay on the path.<br>
If you suddenly realize that you do not know where you are, then here are some things to do:<br>
Don't panic. You can't think clearly when you panic, so take a deep breath and relax.<br>
Pray. You may not know where you are, but God does, so talk to Him.<br>
Stay where you are. It is a lot easier for someone to find you if you stay put.<br>
Listen for the sounds of other campers, traffic, waterfalls, rivers, airplanes or anything that might help you find your way back.<br>
Look around - maybe you'll recognize something that can guide you back to civilization.<br>
. If you have a whistle, blow on it. If you don't have a whistle, yell loudly.<br>
Someone in your party might hear you. Repeat this every 15 minutes or so and be sure to listen after each sounding. (three of anything is universally recognized as a call for help, so three whistle blasts, or three shouts)<br>
7. If you have a map and compass, try to locate your position by looking for hills valleys or streams.<br>
. You can try to relocate the trail, but you do not want to get any further away from your last known location. Mark your location with something - a backpack, hat, or a large rock - but make sure it's something unmistakable. Then venture 10 meters out, and circle your marker, all the while looking about to see if you recognize the trail or a landmark, and always keeping your marker in view. If you do not see anything you<br>
recognize, widen the circle by another 10 meters and repeat. Continue circling your marker at ever wider intervals, but stop when continuing would cause you to lose sight of the marker.<br>
Climb a tree or hillside. A higher vantage point might reveal a landmark you missed from a lower elevation.<br>
If it's an hour or less until sunset, prepare to spend a comfortable evening. Make a shelter, and light a fire. Things will look better in the morning, and your fire may attract a rescuer.<br>

Sleeping bags<br>
Aside from the 3 main shapes of the bag listed below, a more important issue is what is in the bag and how it is stitched. The warmer bags are feather filled (duck down) and the bags are rated by a weight ratio. Other bags have synthetic fiber, also rated by a weight ratio.<br>
Good bags will show either 3 or 4 season or may give an outside temperature value they would keep you warm in. Some bags are rather large and hard to get into your pack. There are now better more compact bags available.<br>
Storing your bag<br>
Do not leave it squashed into its outer bag. Hang it up on a hanger to let the bag breathe when not in use.<br>
Rectangular<br>
The rectangular sleeping bag is probably the most common, and are popular for light use. They are not suitable for backpacking because they provide the least amount of warmth and the most amount of weight. As the name implies, they are rectangle-shaped. While this makes them comfortable and roomy, the wide opening near the top is a major source of heat loss. Unlike a mummy bag it does not have a hood that can be drawn around the head to retain heat.<br>
Mummy Bag<br>
The mummy bag is shaped like a sarcophagus. It is narrow at the feet (but tall there to allow just enough room for the feet), tapers at the waist, widens again at the shoulders, and then tapers down near the head. The top is very much like the hood of a winter coat, complete with drawstrings to close up the gap and keep heat in. Because they conform so well to the human shape, there is very little wasted space inside. This is good because your body has to heat all that space, and because the extra insulation and material thusly removed does not have to be carried (meaning it's lighter).<br>
Barrel Bag<br>
The barrel bag is a modified mummy bag. It is roomier than the mummy bag and provides almost the same warmth at the cost of additional weight.<br>
Sleeping Pads<br>
Sleeping pads can perform two main functions:<br>
Provide cushioning<br>
Provide insulation between the sleeper and the ground.<br>
Air mattresses<br>
Air mattresses are inflatable cushions that can provide a lot of comfort when it comes to sleeping on the ground. Unfortunately, they are not very warm as they provide next to no insulation beneath the sleeper. This may not be an issue, though it is well worth knowing.<br>
Open-cell foam pads<br>
Open-cell foam is a type of foam padding that is sometimes found in furniture cushions or even in regular mattresses. It is lightweight - though somewhat bulky. Its chief disadvantage is that it soaks up water like a sponge.<br>
Closed-cell foam pads<br>
Closed-cell foam makes the ideal sleeping pad. The closed cells do not soak up water. They are lightweight, comfortable, and compact. Often they are only half an inch (12 mm) thick, so they can be rolled into a small tube and strapped to a backpack. They also serve as an excellent thermal barrier between the sleeper and the ground.<br>

Warm Weather Clothing<br>
Keep in mind that the weather can change suddenly though. Just because it is warm when you begin your outing does not mean it will be warm the whole time. If there is a chance that the weather will turn cold, take along some cold weather gear as well. Check an almanac to see how cold it can get during the time you are planning to be out.<br>
Here is a list of clothing appropriate for a warm-weather outing.<br>
 Thick socks<br>
 Jeans<br>
 Light Shirt (short sleeve)<br>
 Light Shirt (long sleeve)<br>
 Hat with a wide brim&nbsp; Boots<br>
Cold Weather Clothing Remember to dress in layers. This will allow you to control your temperature better. In cold weather, you do not want to sweat, because that will soak your clothing and chill you. If you find yourself working up a sweat, remove a layer of clothing, or open a zipper. Rely on wool rather than on cotton, because wool stays warm even when wet. There is a popular saying among experienced outdoorsmen that<br>
&quot;Cotton kills.&quot; This is because when cotton gets wet, it steals the body's heat which can lead to hypothermia and death. Your outer layer should be wind-proof, as this greatly increases the warmth of your clothing. Here is a list:<br>
 Thermal Underwear<br>
 Light shirts (polyester or some other synthetic)&nbsp; Heavy Shirts<br>
 Wool Sweater<br>
 Wind Breaker<br>
 Fleece Pants (synthetic)<br>
 Nylon Pants (as the outside layer) or snow pants&nbsp; Overcoat<br>
 Wool Socks<br>
 Boots<br>
 Warm Hat<br>
Sleepwear For comfortable sleeping and for modesty on overnight trips, bring pajamas or a sweat suit. In many places where it is warm during the day it gets cold at night, so be prepared.<br>
Personal Gear<br>
 Sleeping bag<br>
 Foam ground pad or air mattress<br>
 Flashlight<br>
 Pocket knife<br>
 Quarter roll of toilet paper<br>
 Coins (for campground showers)<br>
 Bible<br>
 Camera<br>
 Notepad and pencil<br>
 Toiletries (Toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, etc.)<br>

There are a lot of aspects to planning a camping trip, including selection of a campground, choosing the dates, the menu, equipment, and solving the problems of getting there. Get your whole group involved in as much of the decisionmaking as possible. Where do they want to camp? When can you go? What will you eat? Who will go? How many tents will you need? Who will sleep in which tents? Is all the gear in a good state of repair?<br>
When all these decisions are made, someone needs to go out and buy the food, repair, replace, or buy any gear that's needed, etc. Every camper under the age of 11 should also have a signed permission slip and an up-to-date medical release form. The forms should be photocopied (reduce them if necessary and use two-sided copies - that way you can have four forms per sheet of paper) and every staff member should carry them at all times.<br>
On the day of the camp out, everyone should meet to load the equipment, and finally, you are ready to go. When you get back, everyone should help unload the equipment. Some should be taken home and cleaned, and if the tents and tarps were even slightly damp, they will need to be pitched again and allowed to dry completely. Then they will need to be put away.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#202122;"><br>
The details vary for every type of tent there is, so we provide only general tips here. First, carefully read the instructions that came with your tent. If it's a new tent, keep the instructions. You might be surprised how easy it is to forget which pole goes where.<br>
First, unpack the tent and spread it on the ground. Some people like to put the ground cloth under the tent, and others like to put it inside. If you're going to put it beneath the tent, spread it out first. Before doing anything else, lie down on the ground cloth and test each sleeping area. If you feel a lump get rid of it now.<br>
Then lay out the tent's canopy (that is, the cloth part that is not the fly). Find the door and orient it where you want it. Then stake it down. This will prevent the wind from blowing it away while you are trying to raise it. Slide the poles into the tubes, but do not raise the tent until the main poles (usually two of them) are all in place. Then raise them together. There are usually aluminum &quot;hooks&quot; located at the stakedown straps and shaped somewhat like a question mark. They are usually a couple of inches long, and are there to slip the pole ends over. Once all the pole are in place, throw the fly over the tent, being careful that the up side is up and the front side is to the front.<br>
Flies often have elastic ropes that attach to plastic clips near the pole anchors, and they also generally have a rope at the four major corners. These should be anchored such that the fly is held off the tent's canopy, usually by staking them down or tying them to a tree. In the &quot;olden days&quot; a taut line hitch would be used to tighten these ropes, but these days the ropes are fitted with a three-hole plastic strap. The end of the rope passes through the bottom-most hole and is tied off with a stopper knot. From there, the rope goes to the anchor (tree, stake, etc.), and passes through the middle hole, and then again through the top hole. The plastic strap can then be slid up and down the rope to adjust the tension. Do not over-tension these ropes - they should have some give so that the tent can move a little with the wind. If they are too tight, the wind will rip the stakes from the ground or topple the tent.<br>
If possible, do not strike the tent until it has dried. If you can, wait until the morning dew has evaporated. This is, of course, not always possible - it could be pouring rain when it's time to go, so you'll have to strike a wet tent. If your tent is wet when you strike it, you will need to set it up to let it dry as soon as you get back. Do<br>
not store a wet tent. It will be quickly ruined with mold and mildew.<br>
To strike the tent first inspect the inside, being sure that everything has been removed. Check the loops in the ceiling (coat hangers tend to hide there) and the &quot;stuff&quot; bags on the walls (glasses and keys tend to hide there). Then sweep the tent. Once everything has been removed, pull off the fly, and stow it inside the tent (spread it out as flat as you can). If you stand next to the tent's door, you can pull the fly off the canopy and stuff it directly inside without it ever hitting the outside ground (and thus picking up dirt, leaves, and moisture). Stowing the fly inside also avoids the sad problem of cramming the canopy and poles into the tent's duffel, and then noticing the that the fly still needs to get crammed in there too. It's one less thing to roll up.<br>
Then let down the poles. Carefully remove the poles from the canopy and fold them up. If the tent poles are sectional tubes with a long piece of elastic running through them all, it is better to push the poles out of the canopy rather than trying to pull them through. Pulling on them merely separates the sections and may break the elastic. Broken elastic will have to be repaired before the tent can be pitched again, because the elastic actually holds the poles together.<br>
Once the poles have been stowed, remove the stakes and carefully fold the tent. Put everything back into the bag it came in. assmant poles Keep any fire at least 20 feet (6 meters) from the tents. Sparks sometimes fly out of a fire or are projected into the air (such as when an inexperienced camper throws dry leaves into it). If these sparks land on your tent, at best they will burn a little pinhole in it, but at worst can cause a deadly tragedy.<br>
Never light a fire of any kind inside a tent, be it a candle, lantern, or a stove unless you know for a fact that the tent has been designed for that purpose.<br>

If camping at a facility that has toilets, use them. If camping in the wilderness, you will have to either build a latrine or use cat holes. Do &quot;your business&quot; at least 60 meters away from any source of water<br>
(such as a spring, river, or lake), and at least 30 meters away from your camp. Dig a shallow hole 7-10cm deep and go there. Then bury it (and any toilet paper). At this depth, there is a lot of bacteria in the soil to quickly compost your waste. Digging deeper will make it take longer.<br>
Just because you are camping does not mean you are at liberty to skip personal hygiene. Wash your hands before you eat and after you answer &quot;nature's call.&quot; Brush your teeth before you go to bed and after breakfast. Wash your face and clean your fingernails.<br>
Keep your kitchen clean too, and wash your dishes as soon as you finish eating. Dishes should be washed with hot, soapy, potable water. A few drops of bleach should be added to your rinse water. It's a good idea to heat dish washing water while preparing meals so that it is ready to use as soon as there are dirty dishes to wash. Be sure the water is not hot enough to scald anyone's hands. Cold water and boiling water can be mixed half-and-half for a comfortable washing temperature.<br>

Knife Safety<br>
 Keep your blades sharp. A dull knife is difficult to push through wood, requiring additional force. When the wood finally gives, the blade keeps going.<br>
 Always push the blade away from you, and constantly consider where the blade will go.<br>
 Keep your fingers clear of the blade at all times.<br>
 When splitting wood with a knife, do not hammer on the back of the blade. This weakens the attachment to the handle and deforms the blade.<br>
 Close a pocket knife when it's not in use or when you are carrying it.<br>
 Keep all blades away from heat. Heat will remove the temper, softening the blade. A soft blade will not hold an edge, making it nearly impossible to keep it sharp.<br>
Hatchet Safety<br>
 Before chopping any wood, take a gentle practice swing to check that the axe will not catch on anything (such as an overhead branch).<br>
 Consider what will happen if you miss whatever you are chopping at - will you accidentally hit a finger? A foot? A bystander? Leave plenty of margin for error.<br>
 Make sure the axe head is firmly attached to the axe handle. If it is loose, you may tighten it by wetting the handle, by driving a hardwood wedge into the handle through the eye of the blade, or by rapping the axe handle vertically on a hard surface.<br>
 Keep bystanders away by one arms length plus two axe-lengths.<br>
 When handing someone an axe, present the handle to them rather than the blade.<br>
 Walk with the blade facing away from you.<br>
 Sheathe the axe when it is not in use.<br>
 Always maintain firm footing when using or carrying an axe.<br>
 Stop when you are tired and rest. Tired people are more prone to accidents and mistakes.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#202122;"><br>
a. Demonstrate ability to choose and prepare a fire site.<br>
Do not build a fire within 6 meters&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot; of a tent. Sparks from the fire can easily travel that far and strike a tent, either burning a<br>
hole in it, or setting it ablaze. If it is occupied, this can be deadly. A fire should likewise not be built underneath trees as it is possible to ignite the tree's canopy. Stay clear of vehicles as well.<br>
There are many ways to prepare an area where you will build your campfire. If you are in an established camping area, look for a place where a fire has already been built. Do not start a fire in a new area if there are fire pits already available. If you must build a fire in a new area, dig out any sod first, and lay it aside. Keep it in the shade (perhaps beneath a vehicle) and water it every day so it does not dry out (perhaps with your rinse water). You will replace it before you leave. If there is no sod, clear out all the duff and debris so that only inorganic material is in the fire ring. Clear an area double the diameter of the intended fire. Then place stones inside this ring, building a small wall as it were. Try to fit the stones so that there are no gaps, or only small gaps. The stone ring should be six to eight inches high, and it should go all the way around the circle. Before you lay the fire, make sure you have a means to extinguish it nearby and ready to go. This could be a fire extinguisher, a bucket of sand, or a bucket of water.<br>
Means of extinguishing the fire should be on hand before the fire is lit. The fire ring should then be ready for a fire.<br>
b. Know fire safety precautions.<br>
 Locate the fire in a safe place. It should be clear for 10 feet (3 meters) all around.<br>
 Do not light a fire beneath overhanging branches.<br>
 Do not use accelerants, such as lighter fluid, gasoline, kerosene, etc. Learn to light a fire without these.<br>
 Put the fire out completely before leaving it. If it's too hot to put your hands in the ashes, it's not sufficiently out. Douse it down with water, turn the coals with a shovel, and be sure to extinguish every coal and ember.<br>
 Do not build a fire on top of flammable material such as grass or leaves.<br>
 Cut away the sod (keep it moist so it stays alive, and replace it before your leave), and clear away the duff and litter.<br>
 Keep fire extinguishing supplies handy and near the fire. A bucket of water or sand, or a fire extinguisher are recommended.<br>
 Do not remove burning sticks from a fire.<br>
 Watch for embers that escape the fire pit and extinguish them immediately.<br>
 Wear proper footwear around a fire.<br>
 Be aware that paper, cardboard, and leaves create floating embers that rise out of the fire pit and may land dozens of yards away.<br>
 Do not light a fire when conditions are adverse (high winds, or drought conditions).<br>
Know how to properly strike amatch.<br>
Three things are needed for a fire to start: oxygen, fuel, and heat. The match head is a fuel that can be ignited at about 360 °F (182 °C), which can be obtained through friction. The oxygen is supplied by the air. To strike a match, quickly and firmly drag the match head along the striker pad on the side of the box or outside of the package. Keep your fingers away from the match head. Once the head ignites, the temperature will increase sharply and ignite the match stick. Fire prefers to climb uphill, and you can control the size of the flame to a certain extent by tilting the head down (for a bigger flame) or up (for a smaller flame). Carefully shield the flame from wind (which lowers the temperature) by cupping your other hand around the flame and move it to the tinder you wish to light.<br>
d.Practice building a fire with the use of one match, using only natural materials.<br>
There are three factors that govern a fire:<br>
Oxygen<br>
Fuel<br>
Heat<br>
You need all three to get a fire going, and the way you lay the fire will determine how much of each of these are available. To get a fire going, you will need to ignite some tinder. The tinder will need to burn long enough to ignite kindling, and the kindling will need to burn long enough to ignite the fuel. Before lighting a match, it is important to have all three types of fuel available.<br>
Start by laying your tinder in the center of your fire ring. Tinder consists of small, easily ignited material, such as pine needles, shreds of birch bark, thin twigs (whose diameter is about the same as a pencil lead), or even dryer lint. Once the tinder is on place, lay some larger pieces over it (this is the kindling). Kindling is wood whose diameter ranges from pencil thickness to 4 cm&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot;. It should be arranged with the smallest-diameter pieces nearest to the tinder.<br>
An effective method of doing this is to get two small fuel logs - about 3&quot; in diameter, and lay them parallel to one another and 15-20 cm apart, with the tinder in between. Then lay a small, straight stick across them and over the tinder. Call this stick the &quot;ridge pole&quot;. Next lay more pencilsized sticks with one end on the ridge pole and the other end on the ground. Lay them alternately on both sides of the ridge pole as if you were framing a roof. These can be called the &quot;rafters&quot;. Once this is done and the rafters make a &quot;roof&quot; that spans the distance between the two logs and covers the tinder, lay two more ridge poles, one on either side of the first ridge pole, and then lay more rafters from them to the ground (but leave a little space between the rafters). You can repeat this a third<br>
time if you like, but it's important to leave a gap somewhere so you can get a match inside to light the tinder. The sticks in each layer of rafters should be a little larger than the ones that came before.<br>
Do not light this pile until you have gathered sufficient fuel for the fire! Fuel consists of wood that is greater than 7 cm<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#202122;"> HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot; in diameter. The tender pile described<br>
above will burn for about five minutes or so, and that does not leave much time for you to scrounge around looking for something to pile onto the flames. Therefore, you should have your fuel ready to go.<br>
Once the tinder is lit, you can use the fuel to lay a hunter's fire, teepee, a log cabin or a council fire on top of the first two logs. It works well, because there is a great deal of kindling stacked close together, but not so close as to reduce oxygen flow. The kindling is also laid close to the tinder so the tinder has no trouble igniting it<br>
(assuming it is dry and pencil-sized).<br>
e. Demonstrate how to protect firewood in wet weather.<br>
Obviously, you will want to keep your firewood dry, and there are many ways to do that. One effective method is to put a tarp on the ground, stack the wood on top of it, and fold the tarp over the top. Place one or two heavier logs on top to hold the tarp down. Those logs will get wet, but they will prevent the wind from blowing the tarp off and soaking the rest of your wood. Having a tarp beneath the wood will keep water from running under the stack and soaking the bottom logs, but this not entirely necessary.<br>
You can also keep firewood in an enclosed trailer, or the trunk of a car if those are available to you. Another option is to keep it under a kitchen tent or canopy.<br>

First you will need a bed of coals. If you attempt to bake your bread over a flame, it will be burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Make the bread dough or bring a frozen tube of pre-made dough. Get a straight stick 100-130cm&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot; long and clean the end of it off. You can do this by removing the bark or by washing it in clean water. Wrap the dough in a thin layer around the stick, spiralling it as you go. The dough should cover the top 10-15cm of the stick. Once the dough is secured to the stick, jam the other end of the stick into the ground or support it with rocks or large pieces of firewood, so that the bread is held over the coals. The bread dough should be held at a distance from the coals where it is uncomfortably hot to hold your hand. Turn the stick every couple of minutes until the outside is golden brown (this is why you need a straight stick). You can eat the bread right off the stick. This is an excellent early morning activity while everyone is tying to warm up around the fire. It works equally well at night.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#202122;"><br>
Make up a mess kit for each camper, consisting of a plate, cup, bowl, knife, fork, and spoon. Store each kit in a mesh hosiery bag. Every mess kit should have a number, and every item in the kit should be labeled with that number. Every camper should be assigned a number. After the meal, each camper will wash his or her own mess kit. If a dirty plate is found abandoned on a picnic table, a quick check for its number will reveal who is responsible for that item.<br>
Use three large tubs for washing the dishes. One will be filled with soapy water (heated if possible), the second one will have rinse water and the third tub is for sanitizing. Plates should be scraped clean or wiped with a paper towel before placing them in the soapy water. This will allow the soapy water to be used longer before the food debris and grease prevents plate from being cleaned thoroughly before rinsing. The sanitizng solution is made by adding one measured tablespoon of Bleach per gallon (do not use scented or high efficiency bleach; old fashioned cheap chlorine bleach is what you need). This solution should have about 100 parts per million (PPM) of chlorine. It can also be used to sanitize food contact surfaces such as cutting boards etc. The key is that the chlorine solution needs to come in contact with the item being sanitized for 60 seconds. Using the third sanitizing tub to soak items for 60 seconds ensures that the plates are properly sanitized.<br>
To conserve water on the camp-out you may rotate the water (and bleach) down the line from clean to dirty. That is you dump out the soapy wash water, wipe out the tub and add fresh soap. Now dump the rinse water into the wash tub and wipe the tub out. Finally dump the sanitizing water into the rinse tub and refill the sanitizing tub with fresh water and bleach.<br>
Each dish should be washed, rinsed, sanitized, and returned to its mesh bag for drying. The mesh bags will then be hung from a clothesline. If the clothespins used to hold them to the line are also numbered, it is a lot easier for each camper to find his or her own kit if they are hung in numeric order.<br>
Whoever is on kitchen duty for that meal (and everyone should be assigned at least once) is responsible for washing the cooking gear. Again, they should wipe the pots, pans, and utensils as clean as possible before subjecting the wash water to them. They will need to be dried after rinsing and then put away. The kitchen crew should then take steps to properly dispose of the trash, lest the camp attract critters. Critters may be cute, but they sure do make big messes!<br>

A good sleeping bag is essential to staying warm at night. Campers should absolutely not go to bed wearing their dirty day clothes. This will only make the sleeping bag filthy and the camper will not be as comfortable. Wear thermal underwear, pajamas, and/or a sweatsuit. Layering will keep you warmer, but if you toss and turn a lot, they may twist around and become uncomfortable.<br>

There are many possibilities for meeting this requirement. Jesus used nature to illustrate object lessons on many occasions:<br>
Birds<br>
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. Matthew 10:29 - NIV<br>
Flowers<br>
And why are you worried about clothing?<br>
Observe how the lilies of the field grow;<br>
they do not toil nor do they spin, yet I say to you that not even (AL)Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. Matthew 6:28,29 - NIV<br>
Water<br>
Jesus meets the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well, John 4:7-38<br>

&quot;Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints&quot; is pretty self-explanatory. It means you do not disturb nature while you are out enjoying it. If you see a pretty rock, leave it there for someone else to enjoy. If you eat a piece of candy on the trail, don't toss the wrapper — take it with you.<br>
There are a few exception to both these rules. If you see trash, by all means, take it. Throw it in the trash when you get to a proper trash receptacle. Also be aware that footprints are not always harmless. Many tundra plants that take years to grow can be destroyed by a single footprint. Stay on the trail.<br>
One of the most important ways people leave their mark on the land is by building a campfire. For &quot;no trace&quot; camping, bring a camp stove. Unfortunately, the campfire is one of the primary attractions for many people, so it is not easy to follow this advice. If your campsite has a fire ring or an existing fire pit, use that. If it does not and you must have a campfire, lay a small tarp on the ground and cover it with six to eight inches of mineral sand. Mineral sand is sand containing no organic material, and can be found on a beach or where a large tree has fallen over and raised a rootwad. The sand must be piled deep so the heat does not affect the tarp beneath. Stop putting new fuel on the fire well before you are ready to put it out, and push in the ends of sticks that have not yet burned. Allow them to burn down to white ash. When you are ready to leave, douse the fire well, and spread the ashes over a wide area. Return the sand to the place<br>
where you found it and pack up your<br>

                                                      <br>
Be considerate of other campers. When purchasing tents, buy ones in muted colors that will blend in with the environment. Blues, greens, and browns are preferred to reds and oranges. People go camping to escape the garishness of the city—leave that behind.<br>
Also be mindful of the noise level made in your camp. Don't be a nuisance. If camping in the wilderness, be sure to make your camp out of sight of the trail. Most National Forests have guidelines for where you can camp in relation to the trail. Find out what those guidelines are and follow them.<br>
Do not enter anyone else's camp site without their permission, especially when traveling to or from your campsite to other places on the campground. It is very rude to cut through another camp. Use the road or trail, even if it will take longer.<br>
Leave the area cleaner than you found it. If you are leading a group of youngsters on a campout, have a contest before you pile back in your cars to go home: see who can collect the most litter (define &quot;most&quot; first though - it can mean by volume, by weight, or by item count). Offer a prize to the one who collects the most (such as getting to choose which seat he or she will sit in on the trip home).<br>
Memorize the 7 Leave No Trace Principles:<br>
 Plan ahead and prepare.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Travel and camp on durable surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Dispose of waste properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Leave what you find.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Minimize campfire impacts (be careful with fire).<br>
 Respect wildlife.&nbsp; <br>
 Always ask for permission before entering another campsite.<br>
Note: If you ever plan to go camping in a location that allows hunting- such as a national forest, bright colors is an important safety consideration. Camouflaged or dark color tents will not aid hunters in quickly identifying that there are people in the area.<br>

Wind- Find areas that are protected from the wind. This requires knowing or guessing at the normal wind direction (hint look at the direction trees are leaning and the current wind direction) Water- Fresh water should be available for drinking, beware of drainage areas, flooding and other water related hazards. Marshy areas can have a high mosquito population that can make camping miserable.<br>
Weather- Knowledge of the weather patterns of an area can help you decide the best location for the camp site.<br>
Wild things- Beware of signs of large mammals such as bear, wolves, and mountain lions. Also watch out for the small wild things such as snakes, spiders, ticks, biting flies and mosquitoes.<br>
Wood- Adequate wood should be available for a campfire, and no dead wood above sleeping area. Survey the trees to make sure that they will not fall on you in strong winds.<br>
Willingness- Make sure the owner of the property is willing for you to camp on it. Make sure you have the proper permits for camping areas.<br>

Going on a camping trip does not absolve you from the need for hygiene and sanitation – it merely makes it a little less convenient. If you are camping on an established campground, use the toilet facilities provided. Otherwise, you will have to provide your own facilities. If you are camping with a small group, this can be as simple as digging a cat hole (no more than 10 cm&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot;) deep, depositing your waste in<br>
the hole, and burying it again. A hole of this depth will be occupied by a myriad of bacterial life which will take care of the rest for you. If camping with a larger group, you will need to dig a latrine. Whether using cat holes or a latrine, make sure they are dug at least 60 meters from any water source.<br>
When cooking, be sure to clean your dishes and kitchen area immediately after use. Again, how you do this depends on the size of your group. When camping with a small group, wipe all dishes, pots, pans, and utensils as clean as you can with paper towels. Burn the paper towels. Then you can scrub the dishes out with clean sand and rinse them off. When camping with a large group, you will need to establish a dish washing area. Fill two tubs with water – use hot water if possible (and it almost always is). You can boil a small quantity of water and add it to a larger volume of cold water, and this will do nicely. One of these tubs will be for washing, the other for rinsing. You can optionally use a third tub for pre-rinsing, which will eliminate the need to wipe the dishes with a paper towel before washing. Add 15 ml&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot; of bleach to the rinse water.<br>
Wipe the dishes as clean as you can first<br>
(or pre-rinse them), then wash them in the first tub with dish soap. Then rinse. Wash the eating dishes first, followed by the cooking dishes. When finished, dispose of the &quot;grey water&quot; as directed by campground management (if on a campground). Otherwise, dispose of the grey water at least 60 meters from any water source.<br>

Weekend campout are a lot of fun, especially if the campers have some knowledge of camping! Once every five years, Seventh-day Adventist Divisions hold a division-wide camporee, where people from all over their division attend. Many clubs from outside the division also attend. In 2009, the North American Division held a camporee in Oshkosh<br>
Wisconsin, and it was attended by 33,000 Pathfinders! The NAD also held camporees in Oshkosh in 1999 and in<br>
2004, and at other locations prior to that.<br>
Within the Divisions are Unions, and many of them hold camporees every five years as well. Union Camporees are held between Division Camporees. Divisions are made up of local Conferences. Many<br>
Pathfinder clubs attend Conference Camporees every year - and some conferences have camporees twice a year (once in the fall, and again in the spring). In addition to these camporees, some clubs go camping by themselves as a club. This is a special bonding time for members of the local Pathfinder club. Of course, Pathfinders also like to camp with their friends and families, and those trips can also be used to meet this requirement. Remember, the more you know about camping, the more fun it is!<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#202122;"><br>
This will depend a lot on the type of stove or lantern you have. There are two basic types of Stoves and Lanterns. Liquid fueled and pressurized gas fueled. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. When lighting your stove or lantern you should recognize the type of fuel it is using and the inherent dangers that each type fuel presents.<br>
The simplest thing to remember is that fuel is flammable and should be treated with respect. Liquid fueled equipment must be carefully filled, and all spills must be cleaned and dried, before the equipment is lighted. Do not fill liquid fueled equipment when it is still warm to the touch or near any source of ignition. This means if you have two stoves in your kitchen, and you need to fill one of them, the empty stove must be taken out of the kitchen to an area a safe distance away (50 feet) to be filled. Also extra fuel must also be stored at least 50 feet from the kitchen area or from any open flame or fire.<br>
On the other hand, pressurized gas cylinders are heavier than liquid fuel cans, hold less fuel per volume and can be damaged and leak. Special chemicals are added to propane or butane to give the fuel a distinctive odor. If you smell gas, turn off all flame sources and seek assistance from an adult before proceeding. A fire extinguisher should always be kept in immediate proximity when operating either liquid fueled or pressurized gas fueled equipment.<br>
Most common camp stoves and lanterns these days use propane canisters. Make sure the canister is connected properly. Then light a stove lighter (these are longstemmed butane lighters) near the burner of the stove or mantle of the lantern. Only after the flame is going should you turn on the gas. If you turn on the gas before you light the flame, the gas can build up and you'll have a small fireball to contend with. This can be very dangerous. If you have trouble, turn the gas off and let it dissipate before attempting again. Once the stove or<br>
lantern lights, adjust the flame or brightness as desired.<br>
Liquid fueled equipment can be more temperamental, however liquid fuel is more compact, and there are no pressurized cylinders to contend with. The thing to remember is that the liquid fuel does not burn, only the fuel vapor burns. So the stove or lantern must first “vaporize” the fuel before the appliance will operate properly. Most liquid fueled stoves and lanterns will also require some type of pressure pump to pressurize the fuel tank. After you pump up the tank (see the manufacturer's instructions for your particular device) you are ready to light the device.<br>
When you turn on a liquid fueled device, at first there will spray a few drops of liquid fuel. Once this fuel sprays, immediately turn off the fuel flow. Many stoves have a built in cup just to catch this fuel. Now the liquid droplets will begin to naturally vaporize. This is what will burn when you light the device using a stove lighter. Once you light this first spray and it begins to burn you can slowly begin to turn on the fuel knob again. What is happening is that the fuel will flow through a tube (often called a generator) that passes through the flame. The flame heats up the generator and the flowing liquid fuel, vaporizing it. Again it is this vapor that actually burns. If the generator has become clogged with dirty residue from previous use it will have to be replaced for the device to operate properly. Once the generator has heated up, use the control knob to regulate the brightness of your lantern or the temperature of your stove.<br>

                                                      <br>
Dig a hole to hold wood. While firewood can be cut with an axe, it takes much less effort, and less wood goes to waste if it is cut with a saw. To do this, prop one end of the to-be cut log off the ground. This can be done by laying it on a rock, on another log, or on anything strong enough to hold its weight. The end of the log should protrude past the support, and the log should be sawn just past this point. If you try to cut a log between the support and the ground, the weight of the log cause the log to sag as it is cut, and this will pinch the saw blade. If you make the cut past the support, the weight of the log will open the saw cut making it easier to saw through.<br>
Dead wood can also be broken instead of sawn. This is often easier and quicker than sawing it, but care must be taken to do this properly, and it can only be done on smaller logs - up to 7 cm&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot; in diameter or so. To do this, again, the log is propped up on a support on one end, while the other end lies on the ground. Then the camper brings his foot down sharply about 12-18 inches (30–45 cm) from the support, between the support and the ground. Be careful to keep your footing while doing this, and watch that the ends of the log do not fly off.<br>

A fuzz stick is a small piece of wood which has had slices cut in the sides to create small shavings. Ideally, the shavings should remain attached to the stick, but if they are accidentally removed, they can still be used. Because the shavings are thin, they are easy to ignite. Because they are attached, they in turn ignite the larger host stick.<br>
                                                      <br>
To make a fuzz stick safely, choose a piece of dry wood, preferably a dry, dead stick from an evergreen tree. The stick should be about the size of a pencil, or perhaps a little larger. Place one end of the stick against a firm surface, such as a log or a rock, hold the upper end with your left hand, and hold the knife in the right. Carefully slice into the stick with a downward, diagonal motion, maintaining even pressure. Stop before the knife reaches the center of the stick. Take another slice a little higher up, and repeat until the stick is covered with the slices of &quot;fuzz.&quot; Turn the stick over and make more shavings on the other side. This is far easier to do with a sharp knife and with a soft wood such a pine, fir, spruce or hemlock. Be sure that you are always slicing away from your fingers. Think at all times about where the knife blade will go if the shaving breaks off, or the knife slips. Make sure that your hand, foot, leg, companions, etc. are not in the path!<br>
Make several fuzz sticks and use them as the first layer of kindling, positioning them atop the tinder. In some cases, the fuzz sticks themselves can be used as tinder.<br>

Council Fire<br>
The council fire was used by Native Americans during their meetings (or councils). It is very much like the log cabin fire except that more than two logs are laid on each layer. Be careful not to lay the logs too close to one another. Leave gaps of at least one inch (2.5 cm) between each log to allow air to circulate. Like the log cabin fire, the council fire is very stable, and it falls into itself as it burns, remaining within the fire ring. Unlike the log cabin fire, the council fire lights easily as the main fuel is located directly above the kindling and tinder where convection will carry the flames. This fire is hot, and will make a nice bed of coals for cooking. It also uses a lot of fuel. This fire is sometimes called a pyramid fire as well.<br>

Hunter's Fire<br>
The hunter's fire is a cooking fire. The logs on top are spaced close enough together such that a pot, pan, or Dutch oven can be placed on them. Try to lay it as level as possible.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Fire safety<br>

 Do not light a fire beneath overhanging branches.<br>
 Do not use accelerants, such as lighter fluid, gasoline, kerosene, etc. Learn to light a fire without these.<br>
 Put the fire out completely before leaving it. If it's too hot to put your hands in the ashes, it's not sufficiently out.<br>
Douse it down with water, turn the coals with a shovel, and be sure to extinguish every coal and ember.<br>
 Do not build a fire on top of flammable material such as grass or leaves.<br>
 Cut away the sod (keep it moist so it stays alive, and replace it before your leave), and clear away the duff and litter.<br>
 Keep fire extinguishing supplies handy and near the fire. A bucket of water or sand, or a fire extinguisher are recommended.<br>
 Do not remove burning sticks from a fire.<br>
 Watch for embers that escape the fire pit and extinguish them immediately.<br>
 Wear proper footwear around a fire.<br>
 Be aware that paper, cardboard, and leaves create floating embers that rise out of the fire pit and may land dozens of yards away.<br>
 Do not light a fire when conditions are adverse (high winds, or drought conditions).<br>

One way to keep food cool without ice while on a camping trip is to place the food in a mesh bag and secure it in a stream or brook. Another way is to put the food in a bag, cover it with several layers of burlap, wet the burlap, and suspend it from a tree branch. As the water evaporates from the burlap, it will cool the food. You have to re-wet the bag occasionally.<br>

This makes it easier to remove the pot without having to slide the hanging handle all the way to the end of the crane. This is particularly useful if you've built a crane that is supported on both sides of the fire. Carve a notch in a forked branch as shown to hang your cooking pot from a crane.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#202122;"><br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#202122;"><br>

Feel free to use whatever is handy for propping up a crane. A large rock or two work as well as a log for this crane.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"> HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Camp_Cooking_Crane_02.svg&quot;<br>

By spiraling the piece of rope around the large stick, you can raise and lower the pot by twisting the stick to wind on more rope, or release more rope. The tripod could also be a forked branch driven into the ground.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"> HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Camp_Cooking_Crane_03.svg&quot; </span><span style="color:#202122;"><br>

Use a weight (Rock) to hold the crane down if the ground is too hard to drive the stick into for support.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"> HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Camp_Cooking_Crane_04.svg&quot; </span><span style="color:#202122;"><br>

                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;">This crane supported on both sides of the fire is a popular choice and provides a stable crane. As seen on the right hand forked branch, use a small pile of rocks to hold the vertical supports where the ground is too hard to drive in a branch.<br>
The pictures here are worth many thousands of words. A simple crane propped on a forked stick will hold a cooking container over a fire. It is best to use green wood for any sticks that will be close to the fire, as green wood will resist catching fire better than a dry stick. Be sure to secure any vertical members so that the crane will not fall over when you hang the pot on it. Drive them deeply into the ground, or pin them in place with large rocks. Test the crane before committing your soup to it. If the pot topples, you will extinguish your fire and lose your soup in one sad incident. But at least you'll have a story to tell.<br>

                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Tent site selection<br>

It is difficult to sleep on an incline. Avoid ridge tops as they will be windy and there is significant lightning danger there. Likewise avoid dry stream beds, especially in desert areas. Flash floods can be caused by rains many, many miles away. If camping near a river, camp above the high water line. The river may rise in the night. You can determine the high water line by observing trees on the river bank - they will have debris in the lower branches deposited there by flood waters. Camp on the lee side of a hill to avoid the wind.<br>
Carefully examine the space above your tent site, making sure there are no dead branches, icicles, coconuts, or anything else that could fall on the tent and cause harm.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;">The details vary for every type of tent there is, so we provide only general tips here. First, carefully read the instructions that came with your tent. If it's a new tent, keep the instructions. You might be surprised how easy it is to forget which pole goes where.<br>
                                                      <br>
First, unpack the tent and spread it on the ground. Some people like to put the ground cloth under the tent, and others like to put it inside. If you're going to put it beneath the tent, spread it out first. Before doing anything else, lie down on the ground cloth and test each sleeping area. If you feel a lump get rid of it now.<br>
Then lay out the tent's canopy (that is, the cloth part that is not the fly). Find the door and orient it where you want it. Then stake it down. This will prevent the wind from blowing it away while you are trying to raise it. Slide the poles into the tubes, but do not raise the tent until the main poles (usually two of them) are all in place. Then raise them together. There are usually aluminum &quot;hooks&quot; located at the stakedown straps and shaped somewhat like a question mark. They are usually a couple of inches long, and are there to slip the pole ends over. Once all the pole are in place, throw the fly over the tent, being careful that the up side is up and the front side is to the front.<br>
                                                      <br>
Flies often have elastic ropes that attach to plastic clips near the pole anchors, and they also generally have a rope at the four major corners. These should be anchored such that the fly is held off the tent's canopy, usually by staking them down or tying them to a tree. In the &quot;olden days&quot; a taut line hitch would be used to tighten these ropes, but these days the ropes are fitted with a three-hole plastic strap. The end of the rope passes through the bottom-most hole and is tied off with a stopper knot. From there, the rope goes to the anchor (tree, stake, etc.), and passes through the middle hole, and then again through the top hole. The plastic strap can then be slid up and down the rope to adjust the tension. Do not over-tension these ropes - they should have some give so that the tent can move a little with the wind. If they are too tight, the wind will rip the stakes from the ground or topple the tent.<br>
                                                      <br>
If possible, do not strike the tent until it has dried. If you can, wait until the morning dew has evaporated. This is, of course, not always possible - it could be pouring rain when it's time to go, so you'll have to strike a wet tent. If your tent is wet when you strike it, you will need to set it up to let it dry as soon as you get back. Do not store a wet tent. It will be quickly ruined with mold and mildew.<br>
To strike the tent first inspect the inside, being sure that everything has been removed. Check the loops in the ceiling (coat hangers tend to hide there) and the<br>
&quot;stuff&quot; bags on the walls (glasses and keys tend to hide there). Then sweep the tent. Once everything has been removed, pull off the fly, and stow it inside the tent (spread it out as flat as you can). If you stand next to the tent's door, you can pull the fly off the canopy and stuff it directly inside without it ever hitting the outside ground (and thus picking up dirt, leaves, and moisture). Stowing the fly inside also avoids the sad problem of cramming the canopy and poles into the tent's duffel, and then noticing the that the fly still needs to get crammed in there too. It's one less thing to roll up.<br>
                                                      <br>
Then let down the poles. Carefully remove the poles from the canopy and fold them up. If the tent poles are sectional tubes with a long piece of elastic running through them all, it is better to push the poles out of the canopy rather than trying to pull them through. Pulling on them merely separates the sections and may break the elastic. Broken elastic will have to be repaired before the tent can be pitched again, because the elastic actually holds the poles together.<br>
Once the poles have been stowed, remove the stakes and carefully fold the tent. Put everything back into the bag it came in.<br>

Remove muddy shoes before entering a tent, or take them off as soon as you enter the door. You can clean the floor in front of the door with paper towels. A stiff broom will also clean most debris from the walls, but you may need to use water and a mild detergent (such as dishwashing soap) to clean messes deposited by birds.<br>

Otherwise, you'll have to roll it up. That's a little more difficult, but not that hard. First check for the tie-strings. They are usually at the foot of the bag. Zip the sleeping bag closed and fold it in half lengthwise with the tie-strings down - one tie string will be located near the center of the bottom, and the other will be located near the edge. Then go to the end opposite the tie strings and start rolling, keeping it tight as you go. When you get to the end, draw the tie strings around the bag and tie them with a shoelace knot.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Tell how to keep a sleeping bag orbed roll dry on a camping trip.<br>

Take off your shoes when you enter the tent (or before going in) so you do not track water all over the place. Keep your sleeping bag on your sleeping pad, as this will raise it off the floor slightly so that any water that drips off wet clothing cannot reach it.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Describe how to properly cleanyour sleeping bag or bed roll.<br>

Unzip it and let it air out completely. Do not put a sleeping bag in a washing machine unless the washing instructions on the bag specifically say that you can. A washing machine will crush the fibers inside, reducing the insulation and padding value. A bed roll can be shaken vigorously like a rug, and it can also be beaten with a stick after hanging it on a clothesline.<br>

Wind- Find areas that are protected from the wind. This requires knowing or guessing at the normal wind direction (hint look at the direction trees are leaning and the current wind direction) Water- Fresh water should be available for drinking, beware of drainage areas, flooding and other water related hazards. Marshy areas can have a high mosquito population that can make camping miserable.<br>
Weather- Knowledge of the weather patterns of an area can help you decide the best location for the camp site.<br>
Wild things- Beware of signs of large mammals such as bear, wolves, and mountain lions. Also watch out for the small wild things such as snakes, spiders, ticks, biting flies and mosquitoes.<br>
Wood- Adequate wood should be available for a campfire, and no dead wood above sleeping area. Survey the trees to make sure that they will not fall on you in strong winds.<br>
Willingness- Make sure the owner of the property is willing for you to camp on it. Make sure you have the proper permits for camping areas.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Fire Safety<br>
                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;"> Locate the fire in a safe place. It should be clear for 10 feet (3 meters) all around.<br>
 Do not light a fire beneath overhanging branches.<br>
 Do not use accelerants, such as lighter fluid, gasoline, kerosene, etc. Learn to light a fire without these.<br>
 Put the fire out completely before leaving it. If it's too hot to put your hands in the ashes, it's not sufficiently out. Douse it down with water, turn the coals with a shovel, and be sure to extinguish every coal and ember.<br>
 Do not build a fire on top of flammable material such as grass or leaves.<br>
 Cut away the sod (keep it moist so it stays alive, and replace it before your leave), and clear away the duff and litter.<br>
 Keep fire extinguishing supplies handy and near the fire. A bucket of water or sand, or a fire extinguisher are recommended.<br>
 Do not remove burning sticks from a fire.<br>
 Watch for embers that escape the fire pit and extinguish them immediately.<br>
 Wear proper footwear around a fire.<br>
 Be aware that paper, cardboard, and leaves create floating embers that rise out of the fire pit and may land dozens of yards away.<br>
 Do not light a fire when conditions are adverse (high winds, or drought conditions).<br>

Once every five years, Seventh-day Adventist Divisions hold a division-wide camporee, where people from all over their division attend. Many clubs from outside the division also attend. In 2009, the North American Division held a camporee in Oshkosh<br>
Wisconsin, and it was attended by 33,000 Pathfinders! The NAD also held camporees in Oshkosh in 1999 and in<br>
2004, and at other locations prior to that.<br>
Within the Divisions are Unions, and many of them hold camporees every five years as well. Union Camporees are held between Division Camporees. Divisions are made up of local Conferences. Many<br>
Pathfinder clubs attend Conference Camporees every year - and some conferences have camporees twice a year (once in the fall, and again in the spring). In addition to these camporees, some clubs go camping by themselves as a club. This is a special bonding time for members of the local Pathfinder club. Of course, Pathfinders also like to camp with their friends and families, and those trips can also be used to meet this requirement. Remember, the more you know about camping, the more fun it is!<br>

The advantage of this fire is that the logs can be of any length, avoiding the need to cut them up. As the ends of the logs burn, they are pushed into the fire. The fire is lit at the center of the star. If the logs are propped up on the fire ring, gravity will feed them in as they burn.<br>

This fire can be used for baking, though it is not as efficient as a reflector oven (which is has a metallic reflecting surface and often surrounds the item. The fire itself can be of any other form, and is placed in front of the reflector. The item to be baked is placed between the reflector and the fire. This fire is also good for getting oneself warm. The reflector can also be a large rock. If you sit (or sleep) between the reflector and the fire, the side of you facing the fire will be warmed directly, while the reflector throws heat to the opposite side. Very toasty.<br>
If making the reflector from logs, the vertical members should be driven deeply into the ground to support the weight of the horizontal members. You can also use rocks to support them.<br>

                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;">Using flint and steel to light a fire is somewhat difficult. In order to use a flint and steel, you take a hard, sharp-edged rock in one hand and the steel striker in the other. The &quot;flint&quot; can be any hard, sharp rock, such as flint, jasper, or quartz. The striker can be any piece of high-carbon steel, such as a knife blade, though strikers made specifically for this purpose work much better.<br>
The other essential item needed for starting a fire with flint and steel is a char cloth. A char cloth is a piece of partially burned cotton cloth. It can be made by cutting pieces of cotton into 1-inch squares, placing them in small a metal container (such as an Altoids tin), and placing that in a fire. If the cotton cannot get much oxygen, it will char rather than burn. Remove the tin from the fire when it quits smoking.<br>
Before you begin, lay your fire so that when you ignite the tinder with the flint and steel, you can place it in the fire and get it going. Once the tinder is lit, it's too late to lay the fire, as the tinder will burn for only half a minute or so.<br>
Place the char cloth on the flint even with a sharp edge, but not covering it. Hold the striker loosely in the right hand (assuming you are right-handed) and strike it against the flint (held in the other hand) as if you were trying to shave the striker with the rock. Flint is harder than steel, so it will indeed shave a piece of steel off the striker. When this piece of red-hot steel is shaved from the striker, it will fly off and hopefully land on the char cloth. You may need to repeat this several times before a spark does actually land on the char cloth, but when it does, the char cloth will catch the spark and begin to glow itself. You then take the glowing char cloth and set it against your tinder. Raw cotton and oakum work especially well as tinder. Blow on it gently until you get a flame. If you don't blow hard enough, the ember will not ignite the tinder. If you blow too hard, you will burn through the tinder without igniting it. Once it flames up, place it in the fire you have already laid.<br>

The glass must be smooth enough to not overly-distort the point of light. A magnifying glass is the typical sort of lens used for this, but there are other possibilities in a pinch.<br>

The &quot;bow and drill&quot; method is well-known and it is a lot of work. The bow is similar to that used for archery. To make such a bow, find a thin rope or flexible but sturdy vine, and a sturdy stick 60-120 cm long. Tie the rope to one end of the stick, and make another knot on the other end of the stick, with the rope between the ends not quite taut.<br>
The drill (or spindle) is another straight stick, thin but strong, preferably stripped of bark, sharpened on the bottom end and rounded on the top. The center of the bowstring (rope) is wrapped around the drill, with the bow and spindle at right angles to each other. The end of the spindle is placed on a fireboard.<br>
The fireboard is a piece of dry, softwood (cedar is excellent), with a conical impression in the top surface (such as might be made with a countersink). This impression is bored near the edge of the fireboard, and a notch is cut into it. The apex of the notch should be at the center of the impression. Place a card or a piece of bark beneath the notch to catch the hot wood which the spindle will grind off the fireboard.<br>
The top of the spindle is rounded and smoothed, and placed in a socket made of a hardwood, bone, stone, or something similar. The socket should be smoothed and greased to reduce friction - you do not want to generate heat in the socket.<br>
Once the equipment is ready, gather some tinder. This tinder should be easily lit. Dry grass, pine needles, and dryer lint all work well for this. Form the tinder pile into the shape of a bird's nest. Then make sure you have enough kindling on hand and an easily lit fire laid with fuel ready to go. When tinder bursts into flames, it is not the right time to start looking for kindling and fuel. Do this ahead of time.<br>
Once the spindle is in place with its bottom tip in the impression in the fireboard, the top held firmly by the socket, and the cord wrapped around its center, the fire builder will move the bow back and forth quickly to rotate the spindle. Long strokes are better than short strokes.<br>
If the socket is pressed too hard, the spindle will not spin. If it is not pressed hard enough, the spindle will come loose.<br>
After only a few seconds of spinning the spindle, the fireboard should begin to smoke. Keep working the bow. After about a minute of smoke, look for a pile of hot wood powder to accumulate in the notch, caught on the card or bark placed beneath it. Stop working the bow and see if the wood powder continues to smoke. If it does not, work the bow again.<br>
When the wood powder continues to smoke after the spindle stops, carefully pick up the card or bark, slide the wood powder into the center of the bird's nest tinder pile, and gently blow on the wood powder. Slowly increase the strength of the air stream blown into the tinder. It should glow red, and as more air is forced into it and the tinder worked into the ember, it should glow even brighter. Eventually when you take your next breath, the tinder pile will burst into flames. Place the burning tinder beneath the kindling and tend the fire as you would any newly lit fire.<br>

'artificial flints' which are metal rods of varying size composed of ferrocerium, an alloy of iron and mischmetal. Mischmetal is an alloy primarily of cerium that will generate sparks when struck. Iron is added to improve the strength of the rods.<br>
Small shavings are torn off the rod with either a supplied metal scraper, a piece of hacksaw blade, or, commonly, the back of a knife ground at a suitable angle. These shavings then ignite at high temperatures, and they are much more effective than their historical equivalent.<br>
While it takes practice and properly prepared tinder to create a sustained fire, the modern firesteel is considered by survival instructors and serious outdoorspeople to be one of the most reliable ways of making fire in severe conditions. Two good examples of firesteel are made by Light My Fire and Blastmatch. The sparks produced by these products are extremely hot, 3000 C° , and easily light toilet paper or small pieces of wood or commercial tinder products.<br>
Traditionally a flint and steel were used; however, the flint was not the important part. With a proper striker, you can get sparks using any hard, non-porous rock that has a sharp edge, even petrified wood. The spark comes from chipping small pieces of steel off the striker; finely divided metals ignite immediately in air, with steel burning at yellow-white heat.<br>
Charpaper can be used as an intermediate step between the striking and the tinder. Charpaper is traditionally made from cotton that has been processed into charcoal. You can make charpaper by taking several patches of cotton denim (from an old pair of jeans for example) and laying them one atop another inside a small tin (such as the ones in which Altoids are packaged). Drill a 3 mm diameter hole in the lid of the tin. Then throw it into a campfire. It should smoke, but not ignite, as not enough oxygen can get into the tin. Once it stops smoking, you can carefully remove it from the fire and let it cool. You should have several<br>
charpapers inside, ready for the next fire you light.<br>
When a spark comes into contact with charpaper, it makes the charpaper glow, but the charpaper will not ignite. After the charpaper glows, you put it against your tender and blow. This works much better than attempting to get a spark to stay on the tinder. Igniting the tinder from the glowing charpaper takes practice. Too much oxygen and the tinder is consumed without bursting into flame; not enough oxygen, and it simply doesn't light. But if you get it just right, it will burst into flames rather suddenly. Be ready for this, as you will then be holding a burning wad of tinder in your hands. Place it in your prelaid fire immediately.<br>

You will need to set up some tinder ahead of time and then prepare to throw an electrical spark. This can be done with jumper cables from an automobile by connecting one end of the terminals to the battery, and then quickly touch the other ends together next to the tinder. Do not hold the terminals together for more than an instant or you will drain the battery.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>f. Compressed air<br>
                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;">In the Pacific Islands near the Philippines, there is a fire building technique that uses compressed air to ignite a small piece of tinder. The technology to do this is similar to a diesel engine and is called a sulpak by the islanders or fire piston by the rest of the world.<br>
The sulpak is usually made out of a water buffalo horn or very dense wood. There are two parts to the device, a piston with a pad on the end, and a cylinder. The piston has a small divot in the end of it that holds a piece of tinder (char cloth works well) Also there is a small groove near the end of the piston that is wrapped with thread to create o-ring. The piston is normally lubricated with pig fat, but Crisco, and Vaseline work well.<br>
The piston is smeared with the lubricant, and a small amount of lubricant is placed in the divot at the end of the piston. The char cloth is then pressed into the grease in the divot.<br>
Push the end of the piston into the cylinder about a half inch. Then hold the cylinder in one hand and hit the pad of the piston with the other. Then pull the piston back out quickly and blow on the tinder. If it doesn't glow immediately you will need to try the process again, or check to make sure that the &quot;o-ring&quot; is tight enough.<br>
There is not enough tinder to catch much on fire, so the best thing to do is light a larger chunk of char cloth and then use this to light the other tinder that will be part of the fire.<br>
It is very difficult to manufacturer the sulpak in the wilderness, so this technique is not good for an emergency unless you just happen to have a sulpak with you. Many outdoor wilderness adventurers will carry their sulpak with them when they go camping and hiking.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#202122;">A tool can be sharpened with a whetstone. Most whetstones need to be kept wet when they are in use – some are wet with water and others are wet with oil. Stones with finer grain typically use oil, but you can use water on them as well. The purpose of wetting a whetstone is to allow the steel removed from the blade to float away. The finer the stone, the finer the edge it will make on a tool, but the longer it will take to sharpen it. For this reason, a very dull tool should be sharpened first with a coarser stone, and then with a finer stone. Then it should be kept sharp. You can keep a blade sharp by respecting it – do not chop into the ground with a hatchet, and to not stick a knife blade in the ground either. Dirt is highly abrasive, and rock will ding the edge very quickly. Close a pocket knife when you are finished using it and do not allow the business end of a blade to touch anything other than the things you are trying to cut with it.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Hatchet<br>
                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;">It is tempting to take a dull hatchet to a power grinder, but unless you are very careful, this could be a huge mistake. A grinder will not only remove steel from a blade, but it will also heat it. It is very easy to heat it too much, causing the steel to lose its temper (tempered steel is hard and holds an edge better than untempered steel). Steel is tempered by heating it to the point that it becomes non-magnetic, then quickly cooling it. If it is allowed to cool slowly, the iron crystals in the blade will align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field as they cool, and aligned crystals make for soft steel. So the first advice we can give on sharpening a hatchet is to stay away from the grinder.<br>
Instead, use a file or a stone. Hold the file so that it passes over the edge of the blade, but at a steep angle. Sharpen one side, and then the other.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Knife<br>

A one-pot meal is any meal that can be cooked entirely in one pot. Often, dehydrated foods are used for this, as they are extremely space and weight efficient. You can buy many dehydrated food packages at an outdoor outfitter, but the selection is limited for the observant Adventist. Many of these foods contain unclean meats (Lev 11) or wine, but there are a few that meet Adventist dietary requirements. If one turns from the outfitters and looks in a grocery store, even more choices are available. Many rice mixes are ideal candidates as one-pot meals (red beans and rice, dirty rice, etc.). Soup mixes also work well, as do pastas, macaroni and cheese, etc.<br>

With the modern materials available these days, tent manufacturers have the ability to change types, styles and shapes of tents.<br>
 The tent poles hold and keep the shape of the tent.<br>
 Poles can be made to be dismantled so that they can be easily transported, are color-coded, and/or linked by chain or a cord, to make it easier to set up a tent.<br>
 Very few guy ropes are needed to tie down the tent (and sometimes none).<br>
 Exact placement of the guy ropes is unnecessary.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Rigid Poles<br>
                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;"><br>
Many tents which use rigid steel poles are free-standing and do not require guy ropes, though they may require pegs around the bottom edge of the fabric. These tents are usually so heavy (25 to 80 kg) that it takes a rather strong wind to blow them away.<br>
 Frame tents are double-skin tents. They have a living area and one or more cotton/nylon/polyester inner tents. The outer tent is draped over a free-standing steel frame, and may be made of canvas or polyester (the latter often has a hydrostatic head of 3000mm, i.e. three season camping). The living area is generally at least as large as the sleeping area, and there may be a specific section with window and extra air vents for use as a kitchen. The walls are nearly vertical and are typically about 150 to 180 cm high (5 ft to 6 ft). The center of the gently sloping roof is often 210 cm (7 ft) high or more and provides reasonable headroom throughout. The smaller 2-person models were less than 3 metres square (10 ft), but these have largely been replaced by dome or tunnel tents. The larger 8-person models may exceed 5 metres (16 ft) in length and/or width.<br>
 Cabin tents are single-skin tents used mainly in the USA. They often have nylon walls, polyester roof, and a polyethylene floor, plus an awning at one or both ends. With a hydrostatic head of only 1000 mm, they may best be considered as summer tents. Removable internal dividers allow the cabin to be split into 'rooms'. Sizes may range from 13 ft by 8 ft (2 rooms) up to 25 ft by 10 ft (4 rooms), with wall and roof heights similar to those of frame tents. There are three separate pole units, with each unit consisting of two uprights and a connecting ridge. These pole units support the centre and ends of the roof, and are usually outside the tent.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Flexible Poles<br>

Flexible poles used for tents in this section are typically between 3 and 6 metres long (10 and 20 feet) and are normally made of tubes of fibreglass with an external diameter less than 1 cm (1/3 inch). For ease of transportation, these poles are made in sections some 30 cm to 60 cm long (1 to 2 ft), with one end of each section having a socket into which the next section can fit. For ease of assembly, the sections for each pole are often connected by an internal cord running the entire length of the pole.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"> HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Dome_tent.png&quot; </span><span style="color:#202122;"><br>

 Dome tents have a very simple structure and are available in a wide variety of sizes ranging from lightweight 2-person tents with limited headroom up to 6 or 9person tents with headroom exceeding 180 cm (6 ft). These may be single wall, or single-wall with partial flysheet, or double wall. Depending on the pole arrangement, some models pitch outertent first, while others pitch inner-tent first. The former helps keep the inner tent dry, but the latter is easier to pitch.<br>
The basic dome has a rectangular floor and two poles which cross at the peak; each pole runs in a smooth curve from one bottom corner, up to the peak, and then down to the diagonally opposite bottom corner. There are usually special fittings at each corner which fit into sockets at the ends of each pole - pole tension keeps everything in shape. The poles usually run outside the tent fabric, which is attached to the poles by sleeves. In some new models clips are also used. Dome tents do not require guy ropes and pegs for structural integrity, but must be pegged down in high winds.<br>
The basic dome design has been modified extensively, producing tents with three poles, tents with irregularlyshaped bases, and other unusual types. A common variation is to add a third pole going from corner to corner on one side; this is angled away from the tent, and supports an extended flysheet or outer tent to give a porch/storage area.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"> HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Nammatjknoydart.jpg&quot; </span><span style="color:#202122;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Tunnel tent<br>
                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;"> Tunnel tents may offer more usable internal space than a dome tent with the same ground area, but almost always need guy ropes and pegs to stay upright. These are almost always double wall tents. Sizes range from 1-person tents with very limited headroom up to 8 or 10-person tents with headroom exceeding 180 cm (6 ft). Tunnel tents have a low end profile making them great for high wind situations.<br>
A basic tunnel tent uses three flexible poles, arranged as three parallel hoops, with tent fabric attached to form a tunnel. The most common designs have a sleeping area at one end and a porch/storage/living area at the other. Smaller designs may use only 2 poles and larger designs may use 4 poles; the latter may have a sleeping area at each end and a living area in the middle.<br>
 Hybrid dome/tunnel tents are now common. One variation is to use a basic dome as the sleeping area; one or two hooped poles to one side are linked by a tunnel to the dome to provide a porch.<br>
Another variation is to use a large dome as the living area, with up to 4 tunnel extensions to provide sleeping areas.<br>
 Geodesic tents are essentially dome tents with 2 or more extra poles which criss-cross the normal two poles to help support the basic shape and minimise the amount of unsupported fabric. This makes them more suitable for use in snowy conditions. To help withstand strong winds they are rarely more than 120 or 150 cm high (4 to 5 ft).<br>
 Single-hoop tents use just one flexible pole and are often sold as light-weight 1 or 2-person tents. These are the modern equivalent of older style pup tents, and have the same feature of somewhat limited headroom. Different styles may have the pole going either along or across the tent.<br>

Most of these tent styles are no longer generally available. Most of these are single-skin designs, with optional fly sheets for the ridge tents.<br>
All the tents listed here had a canvas fabric and used a substantial number of guy ropes (8 to 18). The guys had to be positioned and tensioned fairly precisely in order to pitch the tent correctly, so some training and experience were needed. This made these styles relatively unsuitable for casual or occasional campers. Pup tents might use wooden or metal poles, but all the other styles mentioned here used wooden poles.<br>
 A pup tent is a small version of a ridge tent intended for 2 or 3 people. It usually has a rectangular floor of size ranging from 4 ft by 6 ft up to 6 ft by 8 ft, and<br>
ridge heights ranging from 3 ft up to 5 ft. The side walls are usually about 1 ft high. There are guy ropes for each pole, at each corner, and in the centre of each side, and these guy ropes help to maintain the required shape. Earlier versions had a single upright pole at each end, while later versions often have two poles at each end, arranged rather like an 'A' shape, in order to make access easier. Some models have a horizontal ridge pole joining the tops of the end poles to support the centre of the tent.<br>
 A ridge tent can sleep 5 to 8 people.<br>
They usually have a rectangular floor of size ranging from 8 ft by 10 ft up to 10 ft by 16 ft, and ridge heights around 6 ft to 7 ft. The side walls are usually about 3 ft high. They normally have a single upright pole at each end with the tops joined by a horizontal ridge pole. Longer models might have an additional upright pole in the centre to help support the ridge pole. They often have two guy ropes at each corner, and guy ropes every 2 ft along the sides. If strong winds are expected then two additional storm guy ropes are attached to the top of each pole.<br>
 A square centre-pole tent was often used for family camping in the first half of the 20th century. Despite the use of 9 poles and 12 guy ropes, such a tent could be pitched by an (experienced) family of four in some 10 to 15 minutes. These tents had a square floor of size ranging from 8 by 8 ft up to 15 by 15 ft. There were poles about 5 ft high at each corner and in the middle of each side, and a 10 ft or 12 ft pole in the centre the walls were vertical and the roof was pyramid-shaped, so there was plenty of headroom over most of the tent.<br>

Different types of tents are used for different purposes. A 4 season tent is going to do well for any type of conditions, whereas other types of tents (most today are 3 seasons) don't do as well in all seasons (usually the winter season is not a good time to use such a tent). So, seasons are one way of signifying different types of tents.<br>
The different types of camping would be another way to distinguish the types of tents. A family tent is more than likely going to be heavy (weight wise) and bulky. It will often have lots of room (can fit 6 people). A backpacking tent is small and lightweight. Usually, you won't put the gear in a backpacking tent (you hang your pack or keep it out of your tent). A backpacking tent will fit people snuggly (usually no more than 2 per tent). A mountaineering tent can stand the rough climate and terrain in addition to being lightweight. Mountaineering tents are designed for some gear to fit inside the tent (thus being a little bit more spacious than backpacking tents). Mountaineering tents may also allow for up to 3 or four people to sleep snuggly in a single tent.<br>
The final way to classify tents by different types is by the material used. I don't use this method for teaching camping skills 3 though. Tents may be classified by the materials used to build them (like aluminum poles vs carbon fiber poles, etc.).<br>

Each breath a person exhales contains water because of the moisture content of the lungs, throat, mouth, and nasal cavity. This moisture rises until it comes in contact with a cool surface such as the inside of the tent, where it condenses.<br>
A good tent will be made of breathable material that allows the moisture to pass through (such as a nylon mesh), and there will be a rain fly on the outside to keep the rain out of the tent. Water vapor passes through the mesh and condenses on the fly. It then runs off the underside of the fly and drips off the edge outside the tent.<br>

It is useful when the length of a line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension. It is made by tying a Rolling hitch around the standing part after passing around an anchor object. Tension is maintained by sliding the hitch to adjust size of the loop, thus changing the effective length of the standing part without retying the knot. When under<br>
tension, however, the knot will grip the cord and will be difficult to cause to slip. <br>
It is typically used for securing tent lines in outdoor activities involving camping, by arborists when climbing trees, for creating adjustable moorings in tidal areas, and to secure loads on vehicles. A versatile knot, the Taut-line hitch was even used by astronauts during STS-82, the second Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.<br>
How to tie:<br>
Pass the working end around the anchor object. Bring it back along side of the standing part and make a half-hitch around the standing part.<br>
Continue with another wrap inside the loop, effectively making a round turn around the standing part.<br>
Complete with a half-hitch outside the loop, made in the same direction as the first two wraps, as for a clove hitch.<br>
Dress by snugging the hitch firmly around the standing part. Load slowly and adjust as necessary.<br>

You should take into consideration where your sleeping area(s) are in relation to these water-related areas. Specifically, water flows downhill, so, you do not want water runoff from the 'sink and dishwashing' or 'shower water' flowing to your sleeping area(s).<br>
Also, the location of the 'latrine' should be considered depending on where you get your water source. For example, you do not want to put the 'latrine' upstream and take your shower and wash your dishes downstream. But pay attention! Just because your latrine is downstream and downhill from you does not mean it is downstream and downhill from other campers. Be considerate. A latrine should never be located within 60 meters&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot; of any water supply.<br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Enclosure<br>

It can be as simple as hanging tarps from rope stretched between trees and well-secured. You can also make a teepee from tarps and poles, or build a more elaborate structure from poles using lashings, and covering that with tarps. Another possibility is to use an old tent with its floor removed.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>Commode<br>
                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#202122;">There are many ways to build the commode portion of a latrine. One common approach is to mount a toilet seat on some sort of structure, such as a small log cabin-like structure built using 3-inch (8 cm) diameter logs. It is also possible to build a structure from lumber fastened together with hinges so that it can be collapsed at will (but remain uncollapsed otherwise!) for transport. Another way to build the commode is by lashing poles together to make a couple of horizontal rails - one for sitting on, and another as a back rest. However the commode is built, it is almost always situated over a hole dug in the ground to hold the waste. The depth of this hole depends on how much usage the latrine is expected to accommodate. Leave the dirt pile and a shovel inside the enclosure so that the waste may be gradually buried as it is created. This will hold down the smell. Be sure to completely bury the hole when breaking camp.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>b. Shower<br>

Clean feet can be had by building a platform similar to the table shown above, except that it need not be lashed to any trees - it can simply lie on the ground. If you do not build a platform, you will create a mud hole when you shower, and then everything will be clean except your feet.<br>
Somehow the mud on the feet have a way of migrating elsewhere too, rendering the whole showering experience an exercise in futility. Don't scrimp on the rope when attaching the spars to the poles - the platform must be secure and stable, and the spars must not roll around. Lash them down securely.<br>
For privacy, you can bring a tarp, and string up an enclosure using trees for support. Make the enclosure large enough to hold a chair so the freshly cleaned Pathfinder can remain freshly clean as he/she dries off, gets dressed, and puts on his/her shoes.<br>

A camp sink need not be any more than a few large containers placed on a table. For the containers, you can use a large salad bowl or a plastic storage tub. The table to place them on can be constructed by finding two trees at least 20 cm in diameter and about 2 meters apart. Then using square lashing, attach two long poles to either side of the trees, at waistheight. Use continuous lashings to lash several shorter poles across the support poles to make the table surface. The short poles should all be as close to the same diameter as possible, or if that's impossible, arranged from smallest to largest.<br>

Wrap in a square fashion about three times around the poles.<br>
Wrap two or three times, pulling often to work the joint as tight as possible.<br>
Tie two </span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:#000000;"> HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/half_hitch&quot;half hitches</span></span><span style="color:#202122;"> HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/half_hitch&quot; around the horizontal pole<br>

When the turns are taken around the vertical pole they should be inside the previous turns. The ones around the cross pole should be on the outside of the previous turns. This makes sure that the turns remain parallel and hence the maximum contact between the rope and wood is maintained.<br>
Strength is improved if care is taken to lay the rope wraps and fraps in parallel with a minimum of crossing.<br>
An alternative method is known as the<br>
Japanese square lashing. The Japanese square lashing is similar to the standard square lashing in appearance, but in fact is much faster and easier to use. One drawback to consider is that it is difficult to estimate how much rope is needed, which can lead to needlessly long working ends.<br>
Begin by placing the middle of the rope under the bottom pole<br>
Lay both ends over the top pole, and cross under the bottom pole. Do this about three times. Take care to keep the wrappings as tight as possible.<br>
After the last wrap, cross the ropes again over the bottom pole and frap around the wrappings. Do this enough times (at least 3) to finish with a square knot.<br>
A properly executed lashing is very strong and will last as long as the twine or rope maintains its integrity.

Turn OFF the gas valve completely.<br>
Remove the lantern cover and the glass covering. Place these in a safe and stable place.<br>
Remove any remains of the old mantel. Do this carefully if the lantern is still HOT.<br>
Tie the new mantel in place on the gas pipe. There is a string around the collar that slips over the gas pipe.<br>
Pressurize the gas tank.<br>
. Hold a lighted match near the mantel and turn on the gas valve. The mantel should begin to burn.<br>

Most stoves can use either liquid or gas fuel. Gas-fuel stoves are simpler to operate than liquid-fueled stoves. The gas, being already pressurized, flows from the fuel canister into the burner, where it ignites, in the same manner as a domestic kitchen stove.<br>
Liquid-fuel stoves are more complex because the liquid fuel must be vaporized prior to burning. To accomplish this, the stove design brings the fuel line containing the liquid fuel near the flame of the burner. The heat from the flames converts the liquid fuel to a gas before it reaches the burner, where it mixes with air and is ignited. Some models use a spray system that does not require preheating.<br>
Most stoves operating with liquid fuels must be heated or primed before the burner is turned on. Many stoves require the operator to open the fuel valve briefly without igniting the fuel so that it flows into a small pan. This small quantity of fuel is then lit and allowed to burn down. When the fuel valve is opened again, the fuel vaporizes from the heat of the pan. Some stoves do not have this apparatus and must be preheated by the application of an external heat source such as a solid fuel block.<br>
In many stoves, the priming pressure is generated by a small hand pump that forces air into the fuel container. As the fuel is consumed, the pressure decreases according to Boyle's Law, so the pump must be operated occasionally during use to maintain steady stove operation.<br>
In the picture (above/right), the pressure pump knob is also the cover to the fuel tank. This MUST fits on the tank properly. If this cover is not correctly fitted, you cannot pressurize the stove. You would pressurize the tank by operating the pump several times before lighting the stove. During the course of use, you will need to operate the pump again, to maintain the pressure in the tank.<br>

There are many ways to fulfill this requirement.<br>
This Requirement is intended to have the Pathfinder plan an event and engage their fellow Pathfinders in a meaningful Sabbath experience<br>
The Pathfinder may plan a Themed Scavenger Hunt<br>
A themed scavenger hunt is one option. Your Pathfinders can choose a theme, and then come up with as many items as they think can be found at your campsite and which relate in some way to the theme. They may make a list of these items ahead of time, and hand the lists out when the activity begins. They may tell them that all the items relate to a theme, but not tell them what the theme is. They will need 40 minutes to find all the items, and to meet again at the end of that time period. When they return, they should try and guess the theme. If they do not guess correctly, The Pathfinder who planned the event can tell what the theme is. Then each Pathfinder working on the activity takes turns calling for the items. When someone produces it, the Pathfinder will explain how that item relates to the theme. A spiritual lesson should be drawn from the activity. Close with a prayer.<br>
                                                      <br>
Drawing or Photographing Nature<br>
Many of the honors in the&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;</span><span style="color:#000000;">https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book/Nature&quot;Nature HYPERLINK &quot;</span><span style="color:#202122;">https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book/Nature&quot; category have the requirement to collect, photograph, or draw a number of creatures (plant or animal) found in nature, such as flowers, ferns, insects, etc. The<br>
Pathfinders presenting this activity should bring a field guide so that the chosen creatures can be identified. They may also bring samples of these items with them in case you are unable to find them around your campsite.<br>
If your Pathfinders choose to sketch these items, they need to be sure to bring enough notebooks and pencils (some honors require colored drawings - if so, bring colored pencils) for everyone. If they choose to take photos, each Pathfinder will probably want to bring a camera (disposable cameras are ideal for this).<br>
Collecting specimens is no longer encouraged, as it ends the life of the creature. Furthermore, many species are now endangered, and collecting them is not only unethical, it is illegal as well.<br>
They can also mix photography and sketching. They may wish to have the group set out looking for specimens, and photograph all they can find. Then return and sketch the remainder. If you have only one or two cameras, you may find that this works well for you.<br>
Skits<br>
Choose several Bible stories and divide your Pathfinders into at least two groups of three to eight individuals. Assign each group a Bible story and tell them where it may be found in the Bible. Have each come up with a skit to be presented to the rest of the group. Provide each group with random props and make it a contest between each group to see who can use the most of them. Camping Skills II and III both require such an activity. Your Camping Skills IV students may meet this requirement by organizing the younger units and having them present their work.<br>
Hike<br>
Go on a nature hike. Go along a stream and skip stones.<br>

Learning preservation, etiquette, and conservation is a requirement for Camping Skills I and II, so you can have the<br>
Pathfinders learning this honor review this material and present it to the younger ones.<br>
Be considerate of other campers. When purchasing tents, buy ones in muted colors that will blend in with the environment. Blues, greens, and browns are preferred to reds and oranges. People go camping to escape the garishness of the city—leave that behind.<br>
Also be mindful of the noise level made in your camp. Don't be a nuisance. If camping in the wilderness, be sure to make your camp out of sight of the trail. Most National Forests have guidelines for where you can camp in relation to the trail. Find out what those guidelines are and follow them.<br>
Do not enter anyone else's camp site without their permission, especially when traveling to or from your campsite to other places on the campground. It is very rude to cut through another camp. Use the road or trail, even if it will take longer.<br>
Leave the area cleaner than you found it. If you are leading a group of youngsters on a campout, have a contest before you pile back in your cars to go home: see who can collect the most litter (define &quot;most&quot; first though - it can mean by volume, by weight, or by item count). Offer a prize to the one who collects the most (such as getting to choose which seat he or she will sit in on the trip home).<br>
Explain the 7 Leave No Trace Principles:<br>
 Plan ahead and prepare.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Travel and camp on durable surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Dispose of waste properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Leave what you find.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Minimize campfire impacts (be careful with fire).<br>
 Respect wildlife.&nbsp; <br>
 Be considerate of other visitors.<br>
Note: If you ever plan to go camping in a location that allows hunting- such as a national forest, bright colors is an important safety consideration. Camouflaged or dark color tents will not aid hunters in quickly identifying that there are people in the area.<br>

Estimating the cost<br>
To estimate the cost of the food on your menu, you will first need to estimate the quantity. This can be done with a spreadsheet, or by pencil and paper. First consider how much food your average camper will eat from each meal. Then figure out how much you will need for everyone to be able to eat the average amount. Some will eat more, but some will eat less. For example, if you are serving grilled cheese sandwiches, you will need two slices of bread and one slice of cheese per sandwich. Younger Pathfinder will usually eat two of these, but teens will easily eat three. Picky eaters may eat none or only one. It's up to you to guess how may each person will eat. Then multiply it out to see how many slices of bread you will need. There are usually 20 slices of bread in a load. Before figuring out how many loaves of bread you will need, make sure you consider every meal that will use bread (think French toast, PB&amp;J, etc.). When you know the total number of slices you will need, then figure out how many loaves you will need. If your calculations show that you need 82 slices of bread, don't round it down to 80, or someone may not get a sandwich. Always round it up to the next loaf, so 82 slices will require five loaves of bread.<br>
Do the same with each ingredient in your menu. The more you do this, the better your estimates will be. The goal is to come home with very little left over, as this will tell you that everyone got enough to eat, but you didn't waste money on food that will spoil anyhow.<br>

Weekend campout are a lot of fun, especially if the campers have some knowledge of camping! Once every five years, Seventh-day Adventist Divisions hold a division-wide camporee, where people from all over their division attend. Many clubs from outside the division also attend. In 2009, the North American Division held a camporee in Oshkosh<br>
Wisconsin, and it was attended by 33,000 Pathfinders! The NAD also held camporees in Oshkosh in 1999 and in<br>
2004, and at other locations prior to that.<br>
Within the Divisions are Unions, and many of them hold camporees every five years as well. Union Camporees are held between Division Camporees. Divisions are made up of local Conferences. Many<br>
Pathfinder clubs attend Conference Camporees every year - and some conferences have camporees twice a year (once in the fall, and again in the spring). In addition to these camporees, some clubs go camping by themselves as a club. This is a special bonding time for members of the local Pathfinder club. Of course, Pathfinders also like to camp with their friends and families, and those trips can also be used to meet this requirement. Remember, the more you know about camping, the more fun it is!<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#202122;"><br>
The hardest problem to overcome when trying to build a fire in wet weather is finding dry fuel. Even in the wettest weather, dry fuel can be found by splitting open a log and taking the wood from the center of it. You can get both your kindling and your fuel from this source. Another place to find dry fuel is on the underside of dead branches - especially those still on a tree.<br>
Before you begin gathering your fuel, you will need to set up a dry place to store it as you collect it. A tarp can be used for this if you lay it out on the ground, place the wood on it, and fold the tarp over it. This will keep the wood off the wet ground and keep rain off it as well. If it is windy, you should place a few rocks on top to hold down the tarp.<br>
Once you have your fuel, you can begin gathering tinder. If you have some with you, you're good to go, but remember, that because your kindling may be slightly wet, you will need more than the usual amount of tinder. If you need to collect it, there are still several options for finding some. Milkweed seed pods are fairly waterproof, and the fibers inside are pretty easy to ignite. Pocket lint is another possibility, but you may have difficulty getting enough of it to light your kindling. You can also make wood shavings from the same wood you're using as kindling. If available, birch bark can be lit even when wet.<br>
Once you have your fuel, kindling, and tinder, you are ready to lay the fire. This is done as with any other fire. You may wish to place a tea candle in the tinder pile as well, as this will help keep things going long enough for the kindling to catch.<br>
Once your fire is lit and the fuel is burning, you can lay wet logs next to the fire to dry them out before trying to use them. The heat from a good hot fire can drive the moisture out of even the wettest logs. You may need to turn them over periodically to dry all sides.<br>

                                                      <br>
Wood from conifers (pine, fir, spruce, etc.) contains a lot of highly flammable sap, so it burns both hot and quick. It is excellent for starting a fire. However, it does not leave a bed of coals, so it is unsuitable for cooking.<br>

Unless the log you wish to split has been sawn and has a flat end, it will be very difficult to split it. Steady it on its end, and make sure it can stand on its own. Instruct everyone to clear away from you, and do not swing the axe if anyone is near. Grip the end of the axe handle with both hands, and gently lay the blade of the axe on the top of the log, on the edge nearest where you are standing. Fully extend your arms when you do this, and back up if necessary. Spread your feet apart by about the same distance as your shoulders are wide, and make sure your footing is firm. If you are right handed, slide your right hand towards the head of the axe as you draw it towards yourself. Take aim, and draw the axe over your head, bringing it down mightily as your right hand slides down the handle. The right hand should meet the left about the same time the axe strikes the log. Note how the axe strikes the wood farther away from you than where you were resting it at the beginning. This is why you should aim for the edge nearest you. If you overshoot the log, you will bring the handle down on the edge of the log and damage the axe. Do that enough, and you'll need to replace the handle.<br>
When splitting a log, try to divide it into two equal masses. If you try to split off a smaller segment, the split will run out, and the piece you remove will be smaller on one end than on the other.<br>
To split a small piece of wood (less than 10 cm&nbsp; HYPERLINK &quot;https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Simple_calculator.png&quot; in diameter), place the blade of a hatchet on the end of the log, raise the log and the hatchet together, and bring them down sharply on another log or a rock. When they strike the second log, the hatchet's momentum will drive it into the log. Raise the pair again, and strike repeatedly until the log splits apart. Do not steady the log with one hand and strike it with the other. If you miss the log and hit your hand, you will cause an unnecessary emergency.<br>

The most important thing you must remember about storing food on a campout is that it should never be stored in a tent where people will sleep. Animals will smell your food, and if it's in your tent, they will find a way in. Instead, store the food outside the tent.<br>
If you have a vehicle available at your campsite, you may store the food inside, but be sure to seal it tightly. A determined bear can get inside a locked vehicle, and if he decides that's what he wants to do, the car will sustain heavy damage. On the other end of the animal spectrum, are mice, which can also enter a locked car even the trunk. It is therefore important to seal the food tightly so that the aroma does not draw unwanted attention from unwanted visitors.<br>
If you do not have a vehicle or a trailer in which to store your food, you may place it in a bag and suspend it at least 15 feet (4.5 meters) above the ground by tying the bag to a rope and hanging it over a tree branch. Black bears can and do climb trees, so make sure the bag is well out of their reach - away from the trunk, and at least 4 feet (1.2 m) below the branch from which it is suspended.<br>

A reflector oven is as simple as a cardboard box lined on the inside with aluminum foil. Run wire through the box to create an oven rack. Make sure the rack is horizontal when the box is placed on its side. Put the box next to a bed of hot coals with the opening facing the heat, but not so near as to ignite the box. Put whatever you wish to bake on the rack. Heat from the coals will bake whatever you put inside the box. There are countless variations on this theme, including the practice of completely removing one side of the box and tilting it at a 45° angle. You can prop the box up with rocks or logs, or build legs into it.<br>
You can also construct an oven out of sheet metal, aluminum flashing, or large tin cans as shown below. This tin can oven was constructed by a Pathfinder leader, and tested by Pathfinders in the field.<br>

Boiling<br>
Water can be purified by boiling for five</span><span style="color:#202122;"> to ten minutes.<br>
Iodine<br>
Iodine is added to water as a solution, crystallized, or in tablets. The iodine kills many—but not all—of the most common pathogens present in natural fresh water sources. Carrying iodine for water purification is an imperfect but light weight solution for those in need of field purification of drinking water. There are kits available in camping stores that include an iodine pill and a second pill that will remove the iodine taste from the water after it has been disinfected.<br>
Chlorine<br>
Chlorine-based bleach may be used for emergency disinfection. Add 2 drops of 5% bleach per liter or quart of clear water, then let stand covered for 30 to 60 minutes. After this it may be left open to reduce the chlorine smell and taste.<br>
Filtering<br>
Water filters are also used to make water potable. These filters are usually small, portable and light (1-2 pounds), and filter water by working a hand pump. Dirty water is pumped via a tube through the filter, then out into another flexible tube and directly into a water bottle. These types of filters work to remove bacteria, protozoa and cysts, all of which can cause disease. These water filters should not be confused with devices or tablets that are water purifiers. Water purifiers satisfy higher EPA standards, and also remove viruses, such as hepatitis A and rota virus, among others.<br>

                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">1. What is meant by the term ‘Alive Bible’?<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">An Alive Bible is a friend of Jesus with His Words learned and living in their heart. Some Pathfinders have described it nicely as:<br>
“A Bible with a warm heart; someone who’s faithful to God”.<br>
“Bible told alive through people exploring it in actions”.<br>
“Telling God’s story through my heart”.<br>
“Being a Bible that can talk and has an aim in life”.<br>
“Bible stories being alive in me”.<br>
“Bringing my Bible to life”.<br>
“A friend of Jesus’ with His Words learned and living in their heart”.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">2. </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Understand four shortcuts to learning by heart.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">These twelve shortcuts are like tools in a memory toolkit.<br>
Shortcut 1: Pray<br>
Always pray first. Jesus really wants His Words inside you and He’s totally keen to help!<br>
Shortcut 2: Warm up with the ‘Sparky Brain’ Warm Up<br>
Get both sides of your brain firing with top power for seeing, hearing and doing. Movements<br>
across the middle of your body (your midline) connect the right and left sides of your brain.<br>
You then have more than double the learning and remembering capacity.<br>
Shortcut 3: Prepare the words<br>
Print or write them out in large letters.<br>
Use a new line for each verse.<br>
Divide the adventure into logical, manageable sections, with a heading for each section.<br>
Shortcut 4: Have fun learning in a group. Practice in rhythm together.<br>
Put everyone’s ideas together to plan the places in the story and the movements to use. You<br>
learn the verses very quickly doing the movements in rhythm with your group. When you<br>
practice the verses at home, you remember what your group looked like doing it all together.<br>
Shortcut 5: Muscle Memory.<br>
Muscle memory works with seeing memory and hearing memory. Read the verse out loud 8<br>
times as you help your group choose a movement or gesture for each phrase or sentence.<br>
Once you know the adventure quite well, practice it through with movements and no words.<br>
Shortcut 6: See, Hear and Do<br>
See the words clearly. See the picture of the action clearly in the space around you.<br>
Hear the words, the intentions, the meanings and the emotions with your voice.<br>
Do. Move each phrase or sentence, even if it is the slightest explanation. Move the<br>
adventure through the space around you.<br>
Shortcut 7: Add feelings<br>
Adding the feelings completes the explanation. As in a good movie, people don’t have to<br>
explain their feelings. The feelings are right there in their faces and their bodies.<br>
In your Bible verses, always be on the lookout for your own heart reactions to feelings both<br>
positive and negative. Go through your verses and write down one or two feelings for each<br>
phrase. Put the feeling in your voice, face, and body. Your movement might change a little or a<br>
lot once you’ve added the feeling.<br>
Shortcut 8: Learn in sections - three verses at a time.<br>
Say the last part of the previous verse to connect it with the verse you are learning next.<br>
Decide on an anchor (summary) word for each verse and say them before you practice the<br>
section through. “The bullies”, “when the king”, “in the evening”.<br>
Shortcut 9: Walk<br>
Do NOT learn by heart while standing still. If unable to walk, move some part of your body.<br>
Shortcut 10: Out loud<br>
Always learn out loud.<br>
Shortcut 11: Give to others<br>
Having Jesus’ Words inside you is very special. Giving them to other people blesses them too,<br>
and makes you doubly blessed! People will be amazed and want to know how to do it for<br>
themselves.<br>
Shortcut 12: Review<br>
Saying &amp; doing the adventure EVERY DAY FOR 8 WEEKS gets it into your Long Term Memory.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#ABABAB;">3 </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Demonstrate a clever way to ‘warm up’ your brain. (i.e. the ‘Sparky’ method).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">When we move our arms and legs across the middle of our body (draw a line with your hand<br>
from your nose to your belly button) our brain electricity sends ‘sparks’ across to the other<br>
side. This makes our brain use both sides. It makes us more alert, ready to be clever and<br>
remember quickly. The Sparky Brain Warm Up puts our brain into top gear.<br>
Make sure all the movements cross the middle of your body. Do the Sparky Brain Warm Up<br>
every time you start learning your Bible adventure by heart. Use the following instructions as a<br>
guide. Allow 2 minutes. Everybody on their feet with plenty of room to swing arms and legs!<br>

For this honor we have given a choice of just two Bible adventures. If your leaders have not<br>
nominated one of them, feel free to choose one.<br>
                                                      <em>Note that each adventure has the same three parts:<br>
                                                      </em>Read the story to get a grasp of the story.<br>
Prepare an introduction so as to set the scene.<br>
Learn by heart the key verses of scripture.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Bible Translation(s) to use<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#212529;">Because of the diversity of our Pathfinder folk, we do not specify a specific translation of the<br>
Scriptures for application to this honor. The only stipulation is that it must be ‘true’ to God’s<br>
word. Of course, Pathfinders must be able to understand and identify with it.<br>
The translation used in these notes is the New Living Translation (NLT) second edition. Other<br>
translations can be accessed at </span><span style="color:#08BBEE;">Bible Gateway</span><span style="color:#212529;">.<br>
If English is your Pathfinders’ second language, learning the adventure in their mother tongue<br>
would be great. In the South Pacific Division, the World Changers Bible is the New Living<br>
Translation and the Pacific usually uses New King James Version (NKJV).<br>
The Pathfinder Bible in the North American Division is the New King James Version (NKJV).<br>
Hints for Preparing Scripture Adventure Pages<br>
Divide the adventure which is to be learned into manageable, logical sections.<br>
Start each verse, or phrase, on a new line to make it easy to see and remember.<br>
Use a size 12 font to make it easy to see and remember.<br>

Always pray together first!<br>
Continue to establish the honor as a doing experience by doing the fun warm up together.<br>
Stay standing while exploring the Bible adventure.<br>
Divide Pathfinders into groups of six or more. If you have twelve or fewer in the class,<br>
consider keeping all the creativity together in one group.<br>
Each group sets the story out in their corner. For example ‘the bullies’ hideout is there’,<br>
‘the palace is there’, ‘Daniel’s house is there’, ‘the lions’ den is there’.<br>
Everyone in the group reads their first verse eight times out loud together, while walking,<br>
experimenting with what movement (or two) to use to explain that verse. It’s even quicker<br>
if you listen to the verse from a person or video and copy that, instead of reading.<br>
Then the group decides together which movements to keep for that verse. Please only<br>
offer help when needed; observe and encourage.<br>
Someone can be Daniel, the king, or the stone. Use your imagination. Everyone still tells<br>
the story with voice and movement while that person carries out their action.<br>
The group could decide to have parts of the adventure told by one person. However, each<br>
Pathfinder must still learn all the verses for their solo sharing.<br>
Move from ‘place’ to ‘place’ with the action. Point to the action. Or carry out a movement<br>
in unison which explains the action. The group might split into sections and have the<br>
sections interact with words and movements. Keep experimenting until something<br>
special happens – it always does! Stay prayerful!<br>
By now, everyone has definitely put their pages down. The group practices the verse, all<br>
together, at the same time, out loud, without their pages, at least eight times, until it’s fun,<br>
rhythmical and full of action. Listen to each other; pause between phrases, start together.<br>
Doing just the movements without words shows where the weak parts are!<br>
Then go to the next verse similarly. Take 20 to 30 minutes to learn the three verses that make<br>
up one section of the adventure. There are four sections in each adventure.<br>
Decide on an anchor phrase for each verse – ‘the bullies’, ‘when the king’, ‘in the evening’. Say<br>
these together at the beginning of the section.<br>
If you have four groups, they can simultaneously learn a different section each, and have the<br>
whole passage ready to tell, one group after the other, after the first half hour! Every half hour<br>
(preferably on a different day), they learn a different section, and come together to tell the<br>
adventure through.<br>
Each Pathfinder must be part of sharing the adventure twice; one telling must be solo.<br>
Doing Alive Bible together outdoors encourages creativity. It’s great for camp weekends.<br>
If appropriate, show parents (or guardian etc) the why and how of the honor, so home can be<br>
central in helping learn the adventure and in integrating the spiritual value of Alive Bible into<br>
life in the home. See Appendix C Parents’ Page.<br>

it’s time to prepare the introduction. Teachers, it’s well worthwhile giving a big-picture<br>
introduction to give your honor-participants an appreciation of where the adventure fits into<br>
history and why it is important to learn God’s word. Feel free to use your own words.<br>

heaven but he was jealous of God and wanted to be God. There was war in heaven and the<br>
devil was cast out of heaven with his angel-followers to this earth. The devil wants all humans<br>
to be on his side. See Isaiah 14: 13, 14 and Revelation 12:7-9. Jesus is the Leader of everyone<br>
who wants God’s Light and forgiveness and love and power. But we are born into this world<br>
where the devil claims we all belong on his Dark Side. We don’t have to stay under the devil’s<br>
influence because Jesus has paid the ransom price. All we have to do is ask Jesus to ransom<br>
us and He takes us away from the devil’s team. The Bible is full of reports of people who want<br>
to be on Jesus’ side, how hard He works to get them there, and how big the war between Dark<br>
and God’s Light really is. Learning the Bible adventures by heart makes us strong to stay true<br>
to Jesus.<br>

side too, but they started giving themselves to idols as well, so God had to follow through on<br>
His promise to take His protection away if they took their loyalty away. Daniel was captured by<br>
an enemy king. He chose to stay on Jesus’ side no matter how hard it got. In this lifethreatening adventure, the men on the Devils’ team try to kill Daniel, and he has to decide if he<br>
is willing to die for praying in the open.<br>

about Jesus’ God-sent cousin John the Baptist having been murdered by terrible King Herod.<br>
Many people want Jesus to heal them so their helpers searched the lakeside mountains to<br>
find Jesus. His heart moves with compassion for them and He works all day to give them a<br>
miracle each! As the crowds were hungry and there was no food available, Jesus met their<br>
physical needs by making a feast from a few small fish and loaves of bread. After this the<br>
crowd were keen for Jesus to become their king and fight off the cruel Romans. Jesus knows<br>
this wouldn’t help them be His true Forever Friends, so ….<br>

sharing must be done by yourself. Include your introduction and ‘Bring to life’<br>
the main part of the story. Hint: If you wish, be creative and use modern<br>
technology, such as video etc.<br>
Fill in your Alive Bible Sharing Log, which requires an ‘adult’ listener’s<br>
signature.<br>
There are two stipulations for presenting the Scripture adventure; just the honor participant by<br>
themselves, and by the honor participant accompanied by others. The ‘others’ can consist of<br>
just one person or any number of people. Trainers, please use your judgment as too large a<br>
group is ineffective. Also, it may be an advantage to do the group presentation before the solo<br>
effort.<br>
As stated in the requirement, there’s plenty of scope for the presentations. Think of the<br>
modern technology that is available. As a word of caution, before ‘broadcasting to the world’,<br>
assess the implications of privacy, photo-taking of children etc.<br>
In the SPD, use the Alive Bible 1 Honor’s Workbook to fulfill part b of this requirement.<br>

Think about Jesus more often. Jesus becomes more important. They become more like<br>
Jesus!<br>
They are more certain of how much God loves them. They are a more confident Christian.<br>
They are a stronger follower of Jesus and see themselves as His full-time disciple.<br>
They use God’s Words inside them when making decisions. They rely on God’s Words like<br>
Jesus did.<br>
They face the devil’s temptations confidently, as Jesus did, with God’s Words as awesome<br>
‘weapons of divine power to vanquish the enemy’! Vanquish means to totally win the<br>
battle.<br>
They share about Jesus more naturally with other people.<br>
They get thirsty for more of God’s Words inside them to give them more of God’s love and<br>
power.<br>
They have fun learning the exciting and dangerous adventures of people in the Bible.<br>
They follow their Bible heroes to grow a strong Christian character.<br>
Your group may well think of other effects.<br>

the verse to an existing melody or compose one of your own. Sing your new hymn<br>
either acapella or with music.<br>
This activity may be done as a group.<br>
When setting a passage of text to music, it is a good idea to start with the meter - that is,<br>
count the number of syllables in each phrase. Then divide the passage into segments to<br>
create a structure where the numbers repeat (if possible), and where the divisions between<br>
segments are in logical places. If you are having difficulty with this, try a different translation<br>
of the passage - it will likely have a different meter that may lend itself to this process a bit<br>
easier.<br>
A song's meter is usually expressed as a list of numbers. For instance, <em>Give Me Oil In My Lamp</em><br>
has the meter 10, 8, 10, 9, because there are 10 syllables in the first and third stanzas, 8 in the<br>
second, and 9 in the fourth.<br>
Once you have the meter, look in the metrical index of tunes in a hymnal and see if you can<br>
find something close to what you came up with. If you find something, you should notice that<br>
the tune to that song will work with the passage you are working with.<br>
If you are especially creative, you can make your own melody instead of using an existing one.<br>
Starting with the meter is still a good idea even in this case, and you may find it effective to<br>
come up with a rhythm next, and finally, with the notes.<br>

The requirements necessary to become a teacher vary dramatically from country to<br>
country, and in the United States, it varies from state to state. In general, a four year<br>
bachelors degree is required to teach elementary school, though often there is no<br>
direct &quot;degree&quot; in elementary education. Rather, the education certification is the<br>
&quot;minor&quot; one earns while receiving a bachelors' degree. If one is planning to teach in<br>
secondary school, the teacher often receives a degree in the subject of interest, and<br>
certification (whether denominational and/or state), as a minor or fifth year of<br>
education. Both elementary and secondary certifications require student teaching,<br>
which is either one-quarter or one-semester in length, depending on the program.<br>
The path to becoming a college professor is much more varied. College professors<br>
eventually earn a doctorate in the area of their particular interest and giftedness.<br>
However, they may get that degree immediately after they finish a bachelors' or<br>
masters' degree, or years later either before they began teaching at a college level or<br>
after they have begun their professorship (but usually before they become full<br>
professors). College professors are specialists in their field of study, which means they<br>
have often been professionals in that field for a number of years prior to entering the<br>
college teaching scene.<br>

Recertification is when you have someone’s certification or qualification renewed. Teacher<br>
recertification is the way that teachers keep &quot;current&quot; in the issues that affect their<br>
classrooms, their teaching style, and most importantly, their students. Most students think<br>
that their teachers get the summer off. In reality, most teachers spend a large portion of each<br>
summer attending summer school, taking additional classes that will help them be better<br>
teachers. In most cases, re-certification requirements require that a teacher earn a certain<br>
number of college credits every three years.<br>
There are a variety of certifications and endorsements available to teachers. In the SDA<br>
teaching system, a teacher begins with a basic certification, after three years and some<br>
classes and tests, a teacher may receive a standard certification. After a significant number of<br>
years and education (usually a masters' degree) a teacher is eligible to receive a professional<br>
certification.<br>

When interviewing a teacher, please keep the following tips in mind:<br>
1. Teachers love to tell stories, and love to spend time with people... be prepared to<br>
listen!<br>
2. Because teachers love people, they often have a hard time saying &quot;no&quot; or &quot;could we<br>
do the interview later?&quot; even when they are really busy and have lots of demands on<br>
their time. So, be polite and alert to what might be going on in the teacher's life and try<br>
to find a time not too near test week, a holiday, or the beginning or end of a term.<br>
3. Take good notes. Teachers love to see that you care enough to write it down!<br>
4. If your selected teacher is okay with it, record your interview on an audio or video<br>
device. This will allow you to go back and &quot;review&quot; what you've learned from the<br>
interview.<br>
5. Don't limit yourself to this list of interview questions. Get your heart involved in the<br>
interview, and learn what you can about the teacher and what it is like to be one. This is<br>
a special one-on-one opportunity you have with a special person. Make the most of it!<br>

Historical notes<br>
When the original Honor for Teaching was accepted in 1944, it was for adult Master Guides and had<br>
only one requirement: &quot;Have five years of professional teaching experience on the elementary,<br>
secondary, or college level.&quot;- Junior Missionary Volunteer Handbook, revision of 1957.<br>
Many Honors have grown and changed over the years. Today we focus on development that allows<br>
our youth to participate in and earn any Honor.<br>

But even the simplest melody consists of many important components. Some of the most obvious of these are the varying heights or pitches of the tones, their durations, their loudnesses, their tone colors or timbres, and their articulations.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">Pitch <br>

Psychological studies have demonstrated that few five-year-olds understand the concept of high and low pitch, whereas most nine-year-olds do. Pitch depends on the rate of vibration, or frequency, of sound waves that produce a particular tone. Higher pitches have a higher frequency (greater rapidity of vibrations) than lower pitches. Most musical cultures recognize the octave, a unique relationship of two pitches. <br>
Two pitches are an octave apart when their rates of vibration form an exact 1:2 ratio. Tones an octave apart blend together so smoothly that listeners often confuse the two tones or think they are hearing a single tone.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      </em></span><span style="color:#000000;">A diatonic scale has seven notes in an octave. In the melodic minor scale the pattern of intervals between notes is different in ascent and descent. The intervals between notes 2 and 3 and 7 and 8 (here, d and e, and b and c) are half steps in ascent, but in descent the half steps fall between notes 2 and 3 and 5 and 6 (d and e, and g and a). The intervals between all other notes are whole steps.<br>
                                                      <br>

Since all the intervals are the same, there is no clear tonal center. The romantic period composer Claude Debussy frequently used this type of scale to create the effect of tonal ambiguity. Modern composers of the 20th century who experimented with tonality also used whole tone scales.<br>
                                                      <br>

Pentatonic scales are particularly important in the traditional music of China, Japan, and other countries in east Asia, but they are also found worldwide in a variety of genres from folk to classical.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">c.Time<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Musical rhythm is defined broadly as everything having to do with the way music uses time. More specifically, this includes characteristics such as durations of tones and silences, and patterns of durations, both of which can focus attention on certain tones making them more prominent than others. These more-prominent or accented tones often mark regular patterns that enable listeners to perceive tones as members of larger groups. We can illustrate this sort of perceptual grouping with a simple visual example. Look at the string of numbers in the first line and the string of letters in the second line for a minute, and see if you can see any patterns: <br>
                                                      <br>
The numbers form a simple sequence that repeats itself every three numbers. Rather than saying this is a string of 12 integers, we can recognize that this is a group of three elements each repeated four times. Since the numeral 1 is the first member of each new group, we may pay a little more attention to it. The recurring pattern that enables us to think of these numbers in groups is similar to musical meter (the grouping of beats). In this case, the three-element repetitions are analogous to a common pattern in Western music, triple meter, represented by the metric signature µ. <em>See </em>Musical Rhythm.<br>
                                                      <br>
The string of letters is also fairly simple, because the pattern repeats every four letters. This repeating pattern of four is analogous to quadruple meter, represented by the metric signature ¹. As with the repetition of sets of numbers, the first element in each new pattern claims attention and is more accented and emphatic. But in this sequence a second pattern of emphasis is added by the capital letters. This pattern draws attention away from the expected pattern of accents by shifting the stress to a normally weak beat. This device, known as syncopation, is found in music of many cultures. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">d.Harmony<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">In most music, and especially in Western music, important and style-defining patterns are formed by pitches that overlap with one another in time, producing a chord, or harmony<em>. </em>Two or more tones that occur at the same time form a harmonic relationship called a block chord. These tones are called broken chords or arpeggios when heard separately but in sufficiently rapid succession that the listener perceives them as part of the same harmony.<br>
