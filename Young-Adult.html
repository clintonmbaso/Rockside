1. Belief in the existence of God is the primary truth which lies at the foundation of all religious faith and knowledge. Heb. 11:6 “Whosoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists and He rewards those who seek Him.” (R.S.V.) Prov. 1:7 The basis of wisdom.<br>
                           <br>
2. The existence of God is a revealed truth. The Bible writers make no attempt to prove that God exists. Jesus Christ advanced no arguments to convince men that there is a God. The Bible teaches the existence of God.<br>
                           <br>
3. The following considerations contribute toward belief in the existence of God: <br>
a. God is revealed in Scriptures. <br>
b. The existence of the material universe with its living inhabitants. <br>
c. The universal conviction in men of the existence of a Supreme Being. <br>
d. The universal desire to worship. <br>
e. The universal sense of right and wrong. <br>
f. Jesus Christ’s faith in God. <br>
g. The prophecies of the Scriptures. <br>
                           <br>
4. The most important, and the really conclusive, evidence of the existence of God is to be found in one’s personal experience. Some testimonies of those who knew God:<br>
Jesus John 7: 29; 10:15; 17:25 Jeremiah Jer. 10:10<br>
Job Job 19:25; 42:5 Paul 2 Tim. 1:12<br>
David Ps. 34:10; 42:2 Notes:<br>

1. The first great truth is the fact that God has revealed Himself to men; and we believe because of this revelation. Heb. 1:1 God has spoken to men. “The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate...The Omniscient One is above discussion.” (MH 429) <br>
                           <br>
2. God has revealed Himself in nature. Ps. 19:1-4 The material universe reveals God’s glory. <br>
                           <br>
3. God has revealed Himself in history. <br>
                           <br>
4. God has revealed Himself in the lives of men. <br>
                           <br>
5. God has revealed Himself through the prophets. Amos 3:7 “The Lord Eternal never does anything without telling His servants the prophets.” (Moffatt) 6. The best and fullest revelation of God is in the person of Jesus Christ. John 1:18 “God has been unfolded by the divine One.”(Moffatt) “All that man needs to know or can know of God has been revealed in the life and character of His Son.” (8T 286) We recognize that these revelations are dependent on the Bible for interpretation.

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The Scriptures The special revealings of divine truth have come to men by the prophets and, in a fuller way, by the appearance of the Son of God among men. (Heb. 1:1,2.) Apart from the Scriptures we would have no way of ascertaining either the messages of the prophets or the facts connected with Christ’s life and teaching. We look upon the Scriptures, therefore, as the written record of God’s revelations to the human race. <br>
                           <br>
2. The contents of the Scriptures The Scriptures (from the Latin scriptura, which, like the Greek graphai, means “writings”) come to us in the form of 66 books. This collection of writings has come to be known as the Bible, from the Greek word biblos, meaning “book.” <br>
                           <br>
3. Their date of composition The earliest writer of Scripture was Moses, who wrote about 1,500 years before Christ. Therefore the 39 books of the Old Testament were written over a period of one thousand years. The 27 books of the New Testament were all written before the close of the first century A.D., with the last, the book of Revelation, being written by John the apostle about A.D. 95. Thus, the writing of the books which constitute the Bible covered a period of approximately 1,600 years. <br>
                           <br>
4. Their authorship In the main it was written by some 35 authors, but these men doubtless secured information and used documents written by many other writers. <br>
                           <br>
5. Their arrangement The order of the books in the Hebrew Bible of Christ’s day was not identical with their arrangement in our Bible. There were three main divisions of the Hebrew Bible, as follows:<br>
The Law Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.<br>
The Prophets Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and The Twelve (the minor prophets).<br>
The Writings Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles. The books of our English Bible are, on the whole, grouped according to their literary character, as follows: Old Testament<br>
Law Genesis to Deuteronomy<br>
Poetry Job to Song of Solomon<br>
Prophecy Isaiah to Malachi New Testament 7<br>
History Matthew to Acts<br>
Letters Romans to Jude<br>
Prophecy Revelation <br>
                           <br>
6. Their Language The Old Testament was written in Hebrew except for a few sections which were written in Aramaic. The New Testament was written in Greek and was first translated into English by John Wycliffe in 1382-1388. The King James, or Authorized, Version of the Bible was made in 1611.

1. The claim of Scripture The Scriptures claim to bring us a message from God, not merely to acquaint us with the opinions of the men who wrote them. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) 2 Peter 1:21 The prophecies of the Bible did not originate with men but were prompted by the Spirit of God. <br>
                           <br>
2. The attitude of Christ and the apostles to Scripture Christ and the early apostles received the Scriptures of their day as a reliable and safe guide to the truth containing God’s message to men. John 10:35 “The Scripture cannot be set aside.” (Goodspeed’s translation) John 6:63 Words Jesus speaks are life. “Jesus taught the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority.” (DA 253)<br>
                           <br>
3. Scripture claims substantiated The Scriptures do not furnish us with lengthy arguments to support their claims of divine inspiration. Their authenticity may be tested by evidence which is easily available to every unprejudiced mind. The claim of the Bible to be the medium through which God speaks to us is substantiated by: <br>
a. The evidence of prophecy Isa. 46:9, 10 God claims the ability to foretell. In the Bible there are prophecies which have foretold: The destiny of nations Jer. 29: 10-14 The course of political events Dan. 2:36-45 Events in the natural world Matt. 24:29 The future of cities Isa. 13: 19-22; Eze. 26 The experiences of the church Rev. 12; 2 Thes. 2 The leading facts concerning Christ John 5:39; Luke 24:27, 44 <br>
b. The evidence of personal experience 1 Peter 1:23 The word of God transforms the life <br>
                           <br>
4. The accuracy of the Bible The discoveries of archaeology have proved the historical and geographical data of the Scriptures to be marvelously accurate and true to fact. Check out numerous articles on recent archaeological discoveries in magazines such as Ministry. (Under the General Conference web page, click Ministerial, then Ministry Magazine.) Notes:<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The importance of Bible study Since the Bible brings us the revelation of God and acquaints us with His will, its study is of supreme importance. Joshua 1:1, 2, 6-8 The Lord urged Joshua to meditate on the instructions He had given through Moses. “There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God’s word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times.” (SC 90) <br>
                           <br>
2. The primary requisite It is important to recognize that the primary requisite for the study of the Bible is spiritual. 1 Cor. 2:7-10, 13, 14 The unconverted mind does not understand the wisdom of God. The spiritual man possesses spiritual discernment in all things, and is therefore misjudged by the worldly man. When we say that the primary requisite for a true understanding of the Bible is spiritual, we have in mind: <br>
a. A reverent attitude Ps. 89: 6, 7; 119: 161 <br>
b. An humble mind Isa. 57:15; Ps. 143:10 <br>
c. Prayerful spirit Ps. 119: 18<br>
d. A receptive heart Jer. 15:16 <br>
e. An obedient will Ps. 119:11; John 7:17 <br>
                           <br>
3. Guiding principles in Bible study In order to obtain a correct understanding of a scripture, the Bible student should give careful attention to the following: <br>
a. The correct reading of the text <br>
b. The grammatical construction of the text <br>
c. The meaning of words <br>
d. The context <br>
e. The historical setting One should recognize the unity of Scripture principle: Since the real Author of Scripture is the Holy Spirit, we may properly compare all passages on the same topic for fuller understanding. (Luke 24: 27, 44) <br>
                           <br>
4. The benefits of Bible study 10 Heb. 5:13, 14 Helps us discern between good and evil John 5:39 Acquaints us with Christ 2 Tim. 3:15 Imparts the wisdom of salvation 2 Tim. 3:16, 17 Equips us for God’s service, “equipped for every good work.” (R.S.V.) John 17:17 Sanctifies the life Eph. 6:12-17 Makes us strong in the battle with sin Ps. 119:11 Gives us victory over sin 1 Peter 2:2 Produces spiritual growth 1 Peter 1:23 Is instrumental in producing new birth 2 Peter 1:19 Gives light, reveals future Notes:<br>

1. A distinctive attribute of the true God is His creative power. All things originated by means of His creative word. Gen. 1:1 Our material universe was created by God. <br>
                           <br>
2. Our Saviour shared in the creation of all things. John 1:1-3 All things were made by the Word. “The Word was God.” John 1:14 The Word was manifested to us in the person of Jesus. Heb. 1:1, 2; Gen. 1:2; Col. 1:16, 17; John 1:10 <br>
                           <br>
3. The truth that God is the Creator is a vital truth because the redemption of the sinner necessitates a work of re-creation. 2 Cor. 5:17 The work of redemption is a work of re-creation. <br>
                           <br>
4. The work of redemption begins and culminates in the creative power of God through Christ. John 3:3 The first act in our redemption. <br>
                           <br>
5. Scripture stresses the importance of recognizing God as the Creator of all things. Ex. 20:8-11 The Sabbath was instituted for the purpose of preserving the knowledge of God as the Creator. Rev. 14:6, 7 A special last-day message calls the attention of the world to God as the Creator. <br>
                           <br>
6. The Godhead, or Trinity, comprising the Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit, all had part in the work of creation. (Heb. 1:1, 2; Gen 1:2) Notes:<br>

1. The period of God’s creative work Our earth and the solar system to which it belongs were brought into existence in six literal days. Ex. 20:11 “In six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is.” Gen 2:1, 2 The work of creation was finished in six days. <br>
                           <br>
2. The manner of creation In the creation of the material universe, God was not dependent upon pre-existing material, but spoke the worlds into existence out of nothing by the power of His word. Gen. 1:1 God created the heaven and the earth. The Hebrew word bara’, meaning “to create,” is used exclusively of God in the Old Testament. Only God has power to create in the absolute sense, that is, to make something out of nothing and to give life. Ps. 33:6, 9 The manner of God’s creating, “by the word of the Lord.” Heb. 11:3 Creation is a fact to be accepted by faith; it cannot be demonstrated. “In the formation of our world, God was not indebted to pre-existing matter. On the contrary, all things, material or spiritual, stood up before the Lord Jehovah at His voice and were created for His own purpose.” (8T 258, 259.) <br>
                           <br>
3. The magnitude of God’s creation. Col. 1:16 “By Him were all things created.” 4. God’s care of His creation Ps. 147:4, 5 The stars are all numbered and named. Astronomers have photographed and catalogued millions of stars. Col. 1:17 “In Him all things hold together.” (RSV) Heb. 1:3 “Upholding the universe by his word of power.” (RSV) Notes:<br>

1. God had a definite purpose in mind in the creation of our world. Isa. 45:18 The work of the first five days of creation had for its object the creation of man. Gen. 1:26-28 Man was created to exercise dominion as God’s representative in the world. Gen. 1:26 Made in the image of God “Man was to bear God’s image, both in outward resemblance and in character. Christ alone is ‘the express image’ of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God and in perfect obedience to His will.” (PP 45) <br>
                           <br>
2. God made every provision for man’s welfare and happiness Gen. 1:29 Food Gen. 2:8 Home Gen. 2:15 Employment Gen. 2:18, 21, 22 Companionship <br>
                           <br>
3. The Bible account of man’s origin is directly opposed to the evolutionary theories so prevalent in the world today. According to Scripture: <br>
a. Man did not develop from some lower form of animal life but is a distinct and separate order of creation. (Gen. 1:26-28) <br>
b. Man did not evolve from a semi-brute to higher and nobler ideals, but commenced his existence in the likeness of God, only a little inferior to the angels. (Ps. 8:5; Eccl. 7:29) <br>
c. The original man was not found in the environment of a cave, but lived in the garden of God. (Gen. 2:8, 9) <br>
d. Human existence did not develop from a speck of protoplasm, but in the creation of Adam, who was a son of God. (Luke 3:38) <br>
                           <br>
4. Christ taught the creation story of Genesis. (Matt. 19: 4-8) Notes: <br>

1. The institution of the Sabbath Gen. 2:1-3 The Sabbath was instituted at the close of creation week. The foundations upon which it was established were: <br>
a. God created the world and all that pertains to it in six days. <br>
b. God rested on the seventh day. <br>
c. God blessed the seventh day. <br>
d. God sanctified the seventh day. Ex. 20:8-11 The Sabbath lies at the foundation of true worship. Since we are creatures, we owe the Creator our love, allegiance and worship. So long as the fact remains that God is our Creator, so long will the Sabbath remain as a memorial of that fact. It is thus of universal obligation and was instituted in Eden more than two millenniums before the origin of Israel. <br>
                           <br>
2. The purpose of the Sabbath Mark 2:27 The Sabbath was made for man’s good. It was not provided originally for his physical needs so much as for his spiritual good, to remind him of his dependence upon, and his obligation to, his Creator. Ex. 20:8-11 The Sabbath is a memorial, or reminder, of God as the Creator. “It is to be remembered and observed as the memorial of the Creator’s work. Pointing to God as the maker of the heavens and the earth, it distinguishes the true God from all false gods. All who keep the seventh day signify by this act that they are worshipers of Jehovah. Thus the Sabbath is the sign of man’s allegiance to God as long as there are any upon the earth to serve Him.” (PP 307) Rev. 14:6, 7 The attention of the whole world is to be drawn to the fact that God is the Creator. Ex. 31:13 The Sabbath also became a sign of sanctification. (Eze. 20:12) It symbolizes the fact that God is holy in character, and enables His people to be holy. Thus it assures us of God’s power to recreate us, to redeem us. <br>
                           <br>
3. The results of forgetting the Sabbath Since the Sabbath was intended to preserve the knowledge of the true God as Creator, its neglect naturally results in a loss of this great truth, together with the related truth of God’s saving grace. The true God is distinguished by His creative power. (Jer. 10:10-12) Isa. 58 A chapter of Sabbath reform that calls for all to remember the seventh-day Sabbath. <br>
                           <br>
4. The Sabbath an enduring memorial<br>
a. Since the Sabbath was instituted in Eden for man’s good even before he sinned, its purpose is more than temporal. Its foundations rest upon eternal truths, and its purpose is based upon an eternal need, man’s need of God. <br>
b. There is no hint anywhere in the Bible that the Sabbath was abolished. Luke 4:16 Christ kept the Sabbath. Matt. 24:20 Christ taught His followers to regard the sacredness of the Sabbath after His ascension. Rev. 1:10 John speaks of “the Lord’s day,” which could be none other than the Sabbath. (Mark 2:27, 28; Ex. 20: 8-11; Isa. 58: 13, 14) <br>
c. The Sabbath will be observed in the new earth. (Isa 66:22, 23) Notes: <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
There are three persons in the Trinity. (Matt. 28:19.) <br>
1. The Father <br>
a. The Godhead is eternal. (John 1:1-3; Gen. 1: 1-3; Ps. 90:1, 2.) <br>
b. We have evidence of the Father’s personality. <br>
1. Voice Matt. 3:17 <br>
2. Hearing Ps. 3:4 <br>
3. Sight Prov. 15:3 <br>
4. Love John 3:16; Rom 5:8 <br>
c. We have revelation of His attributes and character. <br>
1. Love 1 John 4:8 <br>
2. Truth and Justice Deut. 32:4 <br>
3. Goodness Ex. 34:6 <br>
4. Supremacy Heb. 1:3 “The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate. The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out in conjectures regarding the nature of God; but the effort will be fruitless. This problem has not been given to us to solve. No human mind can comprehend God.” (8T 279) <br>
                           <br>
2. Jesus <br>
a. Jesus existed from the beginning. (John 1:1-3) <br>
b. He is the second person of the Godhead. (1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 1:3, 8) <br>
c. Jesus is equal with the Father. (Phil. 2:5-11) <br>
d. By Christ “were all things created.” (Col. 1:15-17; Heb. 1:1, 2) “The Father wrought by His Son in the creation of all heavenly beings.” (PP 34) <br>
e. Jesus came to earth to reveal the character of God and to save man. (John 1:18; 14:9; Luke 19:10; Luke 5:31, 32; 1Tim. 1:15) “By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave us an example of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey.” (DA 24) <br>
f. We can have life through Christ. (1 John 4:14; 5:9-13; John 1:12) <br>
                           <br>
3. The Holy Spirit <br>
a. The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Godhead. (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14) <br>
b. Note the work of the Spirit: <br>
1. Reproves and guides John 16: 7-13 <br>
2. Sheds love and light into hearts Rom. 5:5 <br>
3. Leads to God Rom. 8:14 <br>
4. Comforter John 14:16; 15:26 <br>
5. Intercedes for man Rom. 8:26 17 <br>
6. Personal representative of Jesus John 16:7 <br>
c. The Holy Spirit works quietly. (John 3:8) “The wind is heard among the branches of the trees, rustling the leaves and flowers; yet it is invisible, and no man knows whence it comes or whither it goes. So with the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart. It can no more be explained than can the movements of the wind.” (DA 172) <br>
d. The Godhead wants to dwell in us. (2 Cor. 13:14; John 14:16, 17, 23) Notes:</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Wednesday, April 05, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. Sin is rebellion against God. Since God is the Creator and King of the universe, and because of His most gracious attributes of character, every intelligent being owes Him allegiance as a faithful subject of His kingdom. The refusal of Him in one’s life makes one a rebel against God. Such rebellion is known as sin. Isa. 43:15 Our Creator is our King. 1 John 3:4 “Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.” (R.S.V.) <br>
                           <br>
2. Sin is unrighteousness. It is never right to rebel against God’s will, for all His requirements are righteous. Refusal to keep His commandments is always wrong, because His commandments are always right. Ps. 19:7-11 The nature of God’s requirements <br>
                           <br>
3. Sin is dethroning God and putting self in His place. Isa. 14:12-14 Notice how Lucifer’s sin consisted in placing his own selfish interests first, “I will...I will.” <br>
                           <br>
4. Sin is a condition of heart, an attitude of the inward life, and not merely a performance of wrong actions. Matt. 5:27, 28 Sin has to do with inward desires and motives. <br>
                           <br>
5. The dreadful nature of sin. The dreadful nature of sin is evidenced by the illustrations used in Scripture to describe its effects: <br>
a. Isa. 64:6 A moral defilement <br>
b. Isa. 59:2 Separates man from God. (Iniquities have separated.) <br>
c. Rom. 6:23 Brings death d. Rom. 5:12 Robbed all mankind of eternal life. <br>
                           <br>
6. God hates sin and has pledged Himself to its ultimate overthrow and eternal destruction. 1 John 4: 9, 10 God gave His Son to rescue us from the power of sin. Notes:<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Sunday, November 26, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. Sin originated with the devil, or Satan, who is still the moving power behind all evil. 1 John 3:8 The devil sinned from the beginning. <br>
                           <br>
2. Satan was not always a sinful being, but was created perfect as Lucifer, the most honored of the angels. The following passages are primarily addressed to the heathen kings of Tyre and Babylon, through which God disclosed the original position and character of Satan, who in reality is the real power behind these authorities. Eze. 28:13 A created being Eze. 28:15 Originally lived a perfect life God did not create a Satan, but a Lucifer. It was a result of Lucifer’s own decision that he became Satan, the adversary. <br>
                           <br>
3. Lucifer once occupied a position of great authority and importance in heaven. Eze. 28:15, 16 An anointed cherub; a covering cherub <br>
                           <br>
4. By a wrong use of his will, Lucifer became the great adversary of God. Eze. 28:17 Lucifer’s sin commenced with pride. “It is impossible to explain the origin of sin so as to give a reason for its existence. Yet enough may be understood concerning both the origin and the final disposition of sin to make fully manifest the justice and benevolence of God in all His dealings with evil. Nothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God was in no wise responsible for the entrance of sin; that there was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency in the divine government, that gave occasion for the uprising of rebellion. Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it is to defend it. Could excuse for it be found, or cause be shown for its existence, it would cease to be sin. Our only definition of sin is that given in the word of God; it is ‘the transgression of the law’; it is the outworking of a principle at war with the great law of love which is the foundation of the divine government.” (GC 492, 493) <br>
                           <br>
5. Because of his rebellion Satan, with his angel sympathizers, was banished from the courts of heaven. Isa. 14:12-14 The terrible nature of Lucifer’s fall. Rev. 12:7-9 Defeated in heaven, Satan continues his warfare on earth, to which he gained access through his conquest of Adam and Eve.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Wednesday, April 05, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The Bible contains the account of a cosmic battle between good and evil. This battle is called the great controversy. To understand this controversy helps answer the question, ‘Why did Jesus come to this earth?’ <br>
                           <br>
2. The Origin of the Controversy Rev. 12:7-9 The controversy began in heaven. “He [Satan] claimed that angels needed no law but should be left free to follow their own will, which would ever guide them right; that law was a restriction of their liberty; and that to abolish law was one great object of his standing as he did. The condition of the angels, he thought, needed improvement. Not so the mind of God, who had made laws and exalted them equal to Himself. The happiness of the angelic host consisted in their perfect obedience to law. Each had his special work assigned him, and until Satan rebelled, there had been perfect order and harmonious action in heaven.” (SR 18) Psalm 19:7 The issue in the great controversy is the law of God.<br>
From the first the great controversy had been upon the law of God. Satan had sought to prove that God was unjust, that His law was faulty, and that the good of the universe required it to be changed. In attacking the law he aimed to overthrow the authority of its Author. In the controversy it was to be shown whether the divine statutes were defective and subject to change, or perfect and immutable@ (PP 69). <br>
                           <br>
3. The Great Controversy in the Old Testament Gen. 3:1-7 Satan introduced his rebellion here on earth (See lesson 11). The results of the fall of man can be seen in: <br>
a. Gen. 4:1-8 The murder of Abel. <br>
b. Gen. 7-9 The great flood. <br>
c. Job 1 The experience of Job. <br>
d. Ex. 32:1-4 The apostasies of Israel, such as the worship of the golden calf. <br>
e. 1 Kings 18:21-40 The experience of Elijah f. Dan. 10:12, 13 Good and evil angels are involved in this great controversy.<br>
                           <br>
In the annals of human history the growth of nations, the rise and fall of empires, appear as dependent on the will and prowess of man. The shaping of events seems, to a great degree, to be determined by his power, ambition, or caprice. But in the word of God the curtain is drawn aside, and we behold, behind, above, and through all the play and counterplay of human interests 21 and power and passions, the agencies of the all-merciful One, silently, patiently working out the counsels of His own will.@ (Ed. 173) <br>
                           <br>
4. The Great Controversy in the New Testament Matt. 2:16 Satan through Herod tried to kill Jesus. Matt. 4:1-11 Satan tempted Jesus to lead him into sin. Matt. 8:28-34 Jesus cast out demons.<br>
AThe encounter with the demoniacs of Gergesa had a lesson for the disciples. It showed the depths of degradation to which Satan is seeking to drag the whole human race, and the mission of Christ to set men free from his power.” (DA 341) Eph. 6:11, 12 Paul describes the great controversy as a daily warfare with the devil. Rev. 12:13-16 Satan tried to destroy the God=s church throughout history, but God provided a place of safety. Re.v 12:17 In the time of the end Satan will attempt to destroy God=s remnant church. <br>
5. The End of the Great Controversy Luke 23:44-47 The death of Jesus looked like a victory for Satan, but in reality it was the beginning of the end for Satan.<br>
When Christ died on Calvary's cross, he exclaimed in his expiring agony, It is finished’; and Satan knew that he had been defeated in his purpose to overthrow the plan of salvation.@ {ST, September 23, 1889) Rev. 12:12 Satan knows that he has only a little time left. Rev. 20:10 In the end God will destroy Satan and all his followers in a lake of fire. Notes:<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The entrance of sin into this world through the fall of our first parents led the whole human race into sin. It weakened man to such an extent that he found it impossible to resist the power of evil. But Awhere sin abounded, grace did much more abound.@ (Rom. 5:20) In eternity past, the Godhead had laid a plan of redemption for such an emergency, a back-up rescue operation. The fall of man activated the plan immediately. Rom.5:12 Sin entered the world through Adam and caused all men to come under its control- Adeath spread to all men because all men sinned.@ (RSV) Rom. 3:23 All have sinned. Eph. 4:18 Sin darkened man= s understanding of God. <br>
                           <br>
2. The desperate needs of sinful man call for salvation from outside himself. He is unable to save himself: <br>
(a) From guilt (thing committed in disobedience to God=s requirements). <br>
(b) From unrighteousness (a sinful condition). <br>
(c) From weakness or inability to resist evil. What he really needs, therefore, are pardon, regeneration, and power. All these needs are graciously provided for us through Jesus Christ. <br>
                           <br>
3. To make such a marvelous provision for the sinner=s needs, the Son of God came to this earth as a man to conquer the evil one. By taking our human nature (the incarnation) Christ became the Representative Head of our race, our Asecond@ Adam. By engaging in the conflict as a man, living a sinless life, and dying a substitutionary, atoning death He <br>
(1) demonstrated the justice of God= s requirements, <br>
(2) proved the falsity of Satan=s charges, and <br>
(3) made salvation from sin certain for all who would avail themselves of His merits by accepting Him as their Savior and Lord. 1 John 3:8 AThis is why the Son of God appeared - to undo the devil=s work.@ (Goodspeed translation) <br>
                           <br>
4. The plan of redemption comprises three specific stages: justification, sanctification, and glorification. <br>
a. Justification Rom 3:23, 24 Justification is the divine act by which God declares a repentant sinner righteous, or regards him as righteous. Justification is the opposite of condemnation. Rom 5:18 The basis for this justification is not our obedience, but Christ=s obedience, His righteousness. 23 Gal 2:16 Many wrongly believe that their standing before God depends on their good or bad deeds. However, we cannot earn salvation; it is a free gift of God (Eph 2:8). Rom 5:1, 2 Christ=s righteousness becomes ours through faith in Him (Phil. 3:9). Faith or trust is the hand with which we accept the gift of salvation. 1 John 5:12 Justification also brings the assurance of salvation. Christ has made a way of escape for us. He lived on earth amid trials and temptations such as we have to meet. He lived a sinless life. He died for us, and now He offers to take our sins and give us His righteousness. If you give yourself to Him, and accept Him as your Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you are accounted righteous. Christ's character stands in place of your character, and you are accepted before God just as if you had not sinned. (SC 62.2) <br>
b. Sanctification 1 Thes. 5:23 Sanctification means holiness. True repentance and justification lead to sanctification. Justification is what God does for us, while sanctification refers to what God, through the Holy Spirit, does in us. John 17:17 The Bible reveals to us the character of God and of Jesus Christ. Studying it opens the door for the Holy Spirit to change sinners into saints. In justification a man receives the Lord Jesus Christ, and in sanctification he learns to walk in harmony with His will (Col 2:6, 7). Justification takes but a moment; sanctification, on the other hand, takes a lifetime.<br>
                           <br>
The righteousness by which we are justified is imputed; the righteousness by which we are sanctified is imparted. The first is our title to heaven; the second is our fitness for heaven.@ (MYP 35) John 14:15 Salvation includes living a sanctified life; that means living in harmony with God=s commandments, not in order to be saved but because we are saved. c. Glorification 1 Cor. 15:51-54 At the Second Advent God=s people will be changed physically. This is the meaning of glorification. The corruptible mortal body will put on immortality. <br>
                           <br>
5. Christ=s salvation meets every need of the sinner. It is a full, or complete, salvation. <br>
(a) It provides forgiveness. (Col.1:14) 24 <br>
(b) It provides righteousness. (Rom. 3:21-26) <br>
(c) It provides power. (Rom. 1:16) <br>
(d) It rescues from death and gives eternal life. (John 3:16) <br>
                           <br>
6. The salvation provided for us by Christ is the only way of salvation for man. Acts 4:12 Salvation is found only in Christ. Notes: <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. Christ is mentioned almost on every page of the New Testament, and many pages mention Him many times. In regard to the Old Testament writings Jesus said, AThese are they which testify of Me.@ (John 5:39) Thus the purpose of Scripture is to reveal Jesus, whom to know is life eternal (John 17:3). <br>
                           <br>
2. What does the Old Testament say about Jesus? Gen. 3:15 That although God, Jesus would be born of a woman (cf. Isa 9:6). Micah 5:2 That He would be born in Bethlehem. Isa. 53:9, 11 That He would lead a sinless life. Isa. 53: 5-12 That He would bear our sins and atone for them. Ps. 22:16-18 That He would be crucified. Ps. 16:10 That He would be resurrected <br>
                           <br>
3. The Birth and Childhood of Jesus Matt. 1:1 Jesus was to be born as a human being Luke 1:26-35 Mary was a virgin. Her son Jesus was conceived through the Holy Spirit. John 1:14 God became man. The blending and uniting of divinity with humanity is called Athe Incarnation.@ Luke 2:40, 52 As a child, Jesus grew as other human children grew. <br>
                           <br>
4. Jesus the Man We cannot explain how the infinite God and a finite human being can be united in a single person, but the Bible presents Jesus as a person with two natures B a divine and a human nature. <br>
a. His humanity: <br>
(1) 1 Tim. 3:16 Jesus had flesh and blood. <br>
(2) John 4:6 Jesus was tired. <br>
(3) Matt. 4:2 Jesus was hungry. <br>
(4) John 19:28 Jesus was thirsty. <br>
(5) Luke 19:10 More than 80 times Jesus is called the ASon of Man@ in the NT.<br>
Christ did not make believe take human nature; He did verily take it. He did in reality possess human nature.@(1Sam. 247) <br>
b. His divinity: <br>
(1) John 1:1, 14 Jesus, the Word, was God. 26<br>
(2) John 8:58 Jesus claimed to be the great AI AM.@ (Ex 3:14) <br>
(3) John 10:30-33 Jesus said He and the Father were one. <br>
(4) Matt. 12:25 Jesus knew what people were thinking. <br>
(5) Matt. 8:23-27 Jesus had power over nature.<br>
Christ could not have come to this earth with the glory that He had in the heavenly courts. Sinful human beings could not have borne the sight. He veiled His divinity with the garb of humanity, but He did not part with His divinity.@ (RH June 15, 1905; 5BC 1128) <br>
                           <br>
5. Jesus= Sinless Life 1 Peter 2:22 Jesus never sinned. 1 John 3:5 Not only did Jesus never sin, but there was no sin in Him; that is, he had no sinful desires with which every other human being is born. Heb. 4:15 Jesus was tempted in all points like us, but did not yield.<br>
He took upon Himself human nature, and was tempted in all points as human nature is tempted. He could have sinned; He could have fallen, but not for one moment was there in Him an evil propensity.@ (5BC 1128) Throughout His earthly life Christ never used His divine power for His own benefit in His struggle with sin. He exercised in His own behalf no power that is not freely offered to us. As man, He met temptation, and overcame in the strength given Him from God.@ (DA 24) John 8:46 Jesus Himself claimed to be sinless (cf. John 14:30). John 1:29 Because of His sinlessness, Jesus could be the perfect and spotless lamb of God Bour savior. <br>
                           <br>
6. The Ministry of Jesus John 14:8, 9 Jesus came to reveal the true character of God. Rom 8:3 Christ met, overcame, and condemned sin in the world through His sinless life and his death on the cross. John 13:15 Jesus showed us how to live (cf. 1 Peter 2:21). <br>
                           <br>
7. The Death of Jesus Matt 27:33-35 Jesus died a cruel death on the cross. Crucifixion was a characteristic Roman mode of execution. However, Roman citizens were never crucified; this form of punishment was reserved for persons held in utter contempt, such as slaves, the worst criminals, and non-Romans. In submitting to this form of death Christ humbled Himself utterly. (Phil. 2:8) 27 1 Peter 3:18, 19 Through His death Jesus redeemed humanity. (cf. 1 Peter 3:18) The first death is a consequence of death passing upon all men. The second death B eternal death B is the penalty for each individual=s sins. Either the sinner must die or someone has to die in his/her place. Jesus came into this world to take humanity=s place and carry out God=s plan to eliminate sin and death. <br>
                           <br>
8. The Resurrection of Christ Matt 28:1-6 The resurrection took place early on Sunday morning.<br>
AWhen the voice of the mighty angel was heard at Christ's tomb, saying, Thy Father calls Thee, the Savior came forth from the grave by the life that was in Himself. Now was proved the truth of His words, &gt;I lay down My life, that I might take it again. . . . I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.= Now was fulfilled the prophecy He had spoken to the priests and rulers, &gt;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.= John 10:17, 18; 2:19.&quot; (DA 785) 1 Cor 15:12-19 Without the resurrection, the death of Christ would have been in vain. Rom 10:9, 10 Faith in Christ=s resurrection is essential to salvation. <br>
                           <br>
9. The Ascension of Jesus Acts 1:9-11 Jesus was taken up into heaven in plain view of His followers. John 14:1-3 Jesus promised to come back to take us to heaven. Notes: <br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. Salvation provided for all. Through Jesus Christ salvation has been made possible for every human being. John 1:29 Christ is “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (RSV) John 3:16 The Father “gave” Jesus because of His love for the world. <br>
                           <br>
2. Salvation given to those who accept Christ. Mark 16:15,16 He who does not believe in Christ will be lost. Acts 4:12 No escape if we neglect the salvation God offers us. Acts 16:30,31 What must I do to be saved? Believe in Jesus. <br>
                           <br>
3. Salvation something to be sought for. Matt. 6:33 One’s first interest should be to seek the kingdom of God. <br>
                           <br>
4. The meaning of believing in Christ. Belief in Jesus Christ is more than an intellectual acceptance of His teachings or of certain facts concerning Him. Genuine belief in a person is putting one’s reliance upon him, accepting what he promises and acting upon it. Belief in Christ can never be divorced from obedience to Him. John 1:12 To believe in Christ is to receive Him. “The faith that is unto salvation is not a mere intellectual assent to the truth.... The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction by which those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant relation with God.” (DA 347) <br>
                           <br>
5. Steps in experiencing salvation. <br>
(a) Repentance Acts 2:38 This step in coming to Christ is prompted by the Holy Spirit. The word repentance is from the Greek word metanoia, which means “a change of mind, or attitude.” To repent is to change one’s attitude, to alter one’s mind toward God. This repentance or “change of mind” which now sees God, oneself, and others in their true light is a gift from Christ, implanted in the heart through the operation of the Holy Spirit. (Acts 5:31) <br>
(b) Confession Prov. 28:13 Genuine confession is specific and the confessor 29 forsakes the sin confessed. “True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges particular sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought before God only; they may be wrongs that should be confessed to individuals who have suffered injury through them; or they may be of a public character, and should then be as publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite and to the point, acknowledging the very sins of which you are guilty.” (SC 38) <br>
(c) Acceptance of Jesus Christ as personal Savior and Lord Rom 10:9-13 (d) Consecration Rom. 12:1 We are urged to yield our bodies to God. Gal. 2:20 And to be crucified with Christ. “The whole heart must be yielded to God, or the change can never be wrought in us by which we are to be restored to His likeness.” (SC 43) “God does not require us to give up anything that it is for our best interest to retain.” (SC 46) <br>
                           <br>
6. What God does for the penitent who accept Jesus. <br>
(a) Forgives our sins on the basis of Christ’s atoning death. 1 John 1:9 When we have confessed our sins, and yielded our lives wholly to God, we are to believe that God has forgiven us and accepted us as His children. “You have confessed your sins, and in heart put them away. You have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to Him, and ask that He will wash away your sins and give you a new heart. Then believe that He does this because He has promised. This is the lesson which Jesus taught while He was on earth, that the gift which God promises us, we must believe we do receive, and it is ours.” (SC 49, 50) <br>
(b) Accounts to us the obedience/righteousness of Christ on the basis of His sinless life. 2 Cor. 5:21 God made Christ to be sin for us, who knew no sin. (CW) “Righteousness is obedience to the law. The law demands righteousness, and this the sinner owes to the law; but he is incapable of rendering it. The only way in which he can attain to righteousness is through faith. By faith he can bring to God the merits of Christ, and the Lord places the obedience of His Son to the sinner’s account. Christ’s righteousness is accepted in place of man’s failure, and God receives, pardons, justifies, the repentant, believing soul, treats him as though he were righteous, and loves him as He loves His Son. This is how faith is accounted righteousness.” (6BC 1073) <br>
(c) Treats us as His children. 30 1 John 3:1, 2 The Father accepts us as His sons and daughters. <br>
                           <br>
7. Obedience– the fruit of salvation. <br>
(a) Having been forgiven our sins and accepted as God’s children, we are now to live a life of obedience to God’s requirements. John 14:15 Love is expressed in obedience. John 15:10 Obedience is the proof of love. <br>
(b) Christian experience may be defined as the experience of constant fellowship with Christ. “He lived a sinless life. He died for us, and now He offers to take our sins and give us His righteousness. If you give yourself to Him, and accept Him as your Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you are accounted righteous. Christ’s character stands in place of your character, and you are accepted before God just as if you had not sinned. “More than this, Christ changes the heart. He abides in your heart by faith. You are to maintain this connection with Christ by faith and the continual surrender of your will to Him; and so long as you do this, He will work in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure. So you may say, ‘The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.’ (Gal. 2:20) “So we have nothing in ourselves of which to boast. We have no ground for selfexaltation. Our only ground of hope is in the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought by His Spirit working in and through us.” (SC 62, 63) <br>
(c) It is important for true assurance and peace of mind for the Christian to realize that he is always under the umbrella of God’s acceptance (justification) and His cleansing grace as he grows and develops spiritually in the Christian walk (sanctification). (1 John 1:7; 5:11-13) Notes:<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The extent of God’s rule. The kingdom of God is the realm in which He rules or exercises His dominion. Christ designated the dominion of God’s authority as “the kingdom of God” (Mark 1:15) or “the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt. 4:17) Ps. 24:1 “The earth is the Lord’s.” However, the actual exercise of God’s control within His domain is limited, through the invasion of sin. This is because He grants His creatures freedom of choice. <br>
                           <br>
2. The present kingdom of God in this world. The present kingdom of God in this world is a moral or spiritual kingdom consisting of those who willingly acknowledge God as the king of their lives. By speaking of it as a spiritual kingdom we mean that it is concerned with man’s inner life, where the Spirit of God desires to exercise control. The Bible speaks of it as the kingdom “(throne) of Grace.” (Heb. 4:16) Luke 17:21 “The kingdom of God begins in the heart.” (DA 506) <br>
                           <br>
3. How to enter the kingdom of God. Matt. 4:17 Jesus announced the kingdom of God to be at hand. The Jews of His day were expecting a national, worldly kingdom like the kingdom of David, but Christ had not come to establish such a kingdom. Matt. 6:33 Men are to seek the kingdom of God. John 3:1-6 Entrance into the kingdom of God is through conversion—the new birth. Matt. 13:44-46 Entrance into the kingdom of heaven calls for full surrender to God. <br>
                           <br>
4. The future aspect of the kingdom of God. While the kingdom of God begins in this present world in the hearts of those who accept Christ, it will have a future development when sin and sinners are forever eliminated from the universe. Thus the kingdom of heaven has two phases, one pertaining to the present, the other to the future, that is, the present kingdom of grace and the future kingdom of glory. Matt. 6:10 Christ taught His followers to pray for the coming of His kingdom. We enter the kingdom in this life by conversion. When the kingdom triumphs over all its foes and is established in glory, all God’s children will enter it at the second advent, either through translation or resurrection. (1 Thes. 4:16-18.) 32 Dan. 2:44 God’s kingdom will destroy all earthly kingdoms and stand forever. Christ as our divine-human Lord will be king of the coming kingdom of glory, along with God the Father. Thus He chooses to be forever linked with the human family He has redeemed. (1 Cor. 15:28.)

                        <div class="blogdate">Wednesday, April 05, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. Christ the only mediator between God and man. 1 Tim. 2:5 Christ is the only mediator between God and man. Christ’s work as mediator is the work of reconciling man to God. No one else could serve as a mediator between God and man, for Christ alone is both God and man. “By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God.” (DA 24.) <br>
                           <br>
2. Christ the true high priest. In ancient times, man’s need of a mediator was emphasized by the appointment of a high priest, who served as a medium of approach to God in Israel’s worship. Earthly high priests, however, fell far short of meeting the sinner’s need of meditation and could serve only as a dim shadow of the perfect mediator to come and as a constant reminder of the need for a greater high priest who would not be handicapped by human limitations. Heb. 8:5 The ministry of earthly priests was typical of the ministry of Christ. Heb. 3:1; 8:1, 2 Christ is the High Priest of the heavenly sanctuary. Heb. 7:25 Christ is able to save all who “come unto God by him.” <br>
                           <br>
3. The benefits of Christ’s priesthood. Heb. 7:25 It provides a complete salvation. <br>
                           <br>
4. The culmination of Christ’s work. Acts 3:19-21 Christ’s priestly ministry in heaven will be followed by His return to this earth and the restoration of all things. Acts 17:31 His work as mediator will close with a work of judgment. Rev. 19:11-16 At the close of the judgment Christ will return to this world as king. Notes: <br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The Jewish day of atonement. Once a year, on the tenth day of the seventh month of the Jewish year, the Jews were directed to hold a special service in connection with the sanctuary. From the nature of the service held on this occasion the tenth day of the seventh month was called “a day of atonement.” (Lev. 23:27.) The nature and services on the Day of Atonement are described in Leviticus, chapters 16 and 23:26-32. Before proceeding further with this lesson, read these scriptures carefully and become thoroughly acquainted with the order of service performed by the high priest. Be able to answer the following questions: <br>
a. Name all the animals used in the service. Which were for the high priest? Which were for the people? <br>
b. What distinction was made between the two kids selected from the congregation? <br>
c. Explain in detail what Aaron did with the bullock and his blood. <br>
d. What service did the priest perform after his own atonement? <br>
e. What was done with the live goat? <br>
f. What services followed the sending away of the live goat? <br>
                           <br>
2. The nature of the Day of Atonement and its significance. <br>
a. The Jewish day of atonement was, in its nature, a day of judgment, standing as a fitting type of the great day of final judgment at the end of the gospel era. Acts 17:31 God has appointed a day of final judgment for the whole world. Rom. 14:10, 12 All will be called to account in the judgment. <br>
b. The services performed on the typical day of atonement were for the purpose of bringing the professed people of God into perfect oneness with God by the complete separation of sin from the camp of Israel. They pointed to a day when God will bring the whole problem of sin to a finality. <br>
c. The cleansing of the earthly sanctuary was associated with the entry of the high priest into the place of judgment, in the second apartment of the sanctuary, where the Decalogue was kept. (Lev. 16:12-14; Heb. 9:7)<br>
The cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary would signify the work of Christ at the<br>
judgment throne of God in heaven. (Acts 17:31; Dan. 8:14; 7:9, 10) <br>
d. The cleansing agency in the earthly sanctuary was the blood of an animal upon which no hand had been placed or sin confessed. We are cleansed from our sins through the merits of the sacrifice of Christ. (1 John 1:7; Heb. 9:13, 14; 1 Peter 1:18, 19) <br>
e. The sprinkling of the blood, typifying Christ’s life, in the most holy place over the Ten Commandments, is a fitting type of how the righteousness of Christ satisfies the claims of the moral law in the judgment. <br>
f. The goat or Azazel represents Satan. It was not used as a sacrifice, or for cleansing any part of the sanctuary, and could not therefore typify Christ. <br>
g. The confession of all the sins of the children of Israel on the head of the Azazel goat signifies his responsibility for them. <br>
h. The change of garments by the high priest signified the termination of his work on the Day of 35 Atonement. <br>
i. The offering of the two rams for a burnt offering signified the entire consecration of Israel to God. Notes:<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The divine program of events. a. God works to a definite program. Eccl. 3:1 A time for every purpose. Gal. 4:4 Christ came to this world according to God’s time. b. God revealed in Bible prophecy the definite time when Christ would enter upon His work in the second apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, which marks the last phase of His work as high priest before He returns to this earth. Dan. 8:14 “Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” Eze. 4:6; Num. 14:34 Inasmuch as a day in prophecy symbolizes a year, this period is a period of 2300 years. <br>
                           <br>
2. The time period (2300 days) is not explained. Dan. 8:14-27 Gabriel explains the meaning of the symbols for the ram, goat, four horns, and little persecuting horn, but stops short of explaining the time period relating to the sanctuary because Daniel becomes sick over the revelation. <br>
                           <br>
3. The dating of the 2300-day/year prophecy. <br>
a. Daniel’s prayer Dan. 9:1-19 A number of years passed, but Daniel received no further word on this prophecy. He naturally feared it implied an extension of the captivity and continued desolation of the sanctuary-temple at Jerusalem. He discovered from Jeremiah’s prophecy that the 70 years of captivity were about to end, and he set himself to pray for Israel’s forgiveness and return. <br>
b. Return of Gabriel Dan. 9:20-23 With the touch from Gabriel, Daniel is immediately in vision. He recalls the angel’s interpretation in the earlier vision (ch. 8). His attention is immediately directed to the unexplained portion of the vision dealing with the time period. <br>
c. The 70-week period Dan. 9:24-27 Seventy weeks or 490 days/years (70x7 = 490) are said to be “determined” or “cut off” (root meaning of Hebrew word) for certain things to be accomplished in connection with God’s people Israel. The natural sense is that this shorter period was to be “cut off” from the longer 2300-day period as its first part. Thus the beginning of the 490 days/years would also be the beginning of the 37 2300 days/years. <br>
d. Dating the 70 weeks Dan. 9:25 There were three decrees which gave permission for the Hebrew exiles to return home. The decree of Cyrus in 537 B.C. had to do with rebuilding the temple, restoration of the sacred vessels and the temple worship. (Ezra 1:1-4) The decree of Darius in 519 B.C. was a renewal of Cyrus’ command. Finally, the decree of Artaxerxes in 457 B.C., in addition to promoting the reestablishing of the worship in Jerusalem, made possible the setting up of a Hebrew state and local government. (Ezra 7:11-26) Neither Cyrus nor Darius made any genuine provision for the restoration of the civil state as a complete unit, though a restoration of both the religious and civil government was promised in the prophecy of Daniel. The decree of the seventh year of Artaxerxes was the first to give the Jewish state full autonomy, subject to the overlordship of the Persian Empire. Therefore we take 457 B.C. as the required date for the commencement of the 70 weeks. The decree of Artaxerxes went forth in the autumn of 457 B.C. (Ezra 7:8, 9) and therefore approximately half of the year had gone, for the Jewish year begins in the spring. We are to reckon the 70 weeks from “the going forth [or publication] of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem.” (Dan. 9:25) <br>
e. The events of the 70 weeks 1. During the first 7 weeks (49 years), terminating in the autumn of 408 B.C., Jerusalem was to be rebuilt. (Dan. 9:25) 2. The 62 weeks, terminating in A.D. 27 (autumn), reach to the Messiah, (verse 25) The Messiah is Christ, the Anointed One. (John 1:41, margin) Christ was anointed with the Holy Spirit. (Acts 10:38) This anointing took place at His baptism. (Mark 1:10) Christ stated that a time prophecy was fulfilled at the time of His baptism. (Mark 1:15) 3. The remaining week would terminate in A.D. 34 (autumn). <br>
                           <br>
4. In the midst of the week, A.D. 31 (spring), Christ was crucified. <br>
                           <br>
5. The special privileges granted to the Jews ceased in A.D. 34 (verse 24, first part), and from then on the gospel went to the Gentiles. <br>
                           <br>
6. The remaining 1810 years from A.D. 34 (autumn) bring us to the autumn of 1844. 4. Thus it is clear that the cleansing of the sanctuary in heaven commenced in 1844. This means that in that year Christ entered upon the last phase of His mediatorial work for man. To the Adventists of 1844, “the subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disappointment of 1844.” (GC 423)<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. A definite time appointed. Acts 17:31 A definite day has been divinely appointed for the judgment of the world. Rom. 14:10, 12 No one can escape the judgment day. Every person must answer individually before God. 2 Cor. 5:10 Even the professed followers of God must stand in the judgment. The subject of the ultimate judgment is described in the Bible in three phases: <br>
(1) investigative, <br>
(2) review, <br>
(3) executive. <br>
The investigative phase takes place in heaven before the loyal angels and universe and involves a review of all the professed followers of God recorded in the Book of Life. In a sense this phase of judgment settles the destiny of all humankind because it not only will determine who are the genuine believers in the Book of Life but, when it is concluded, probation will close for all persons. When Jesus returns, He brings his reward with Him. <br>
(Rev. 22:12) The review phase of judgment also takes place in heaven, permitting the redeemed to better understand the issues of the great moral controversy. <br>
The executive phase of judgment takes place on the earth at the close of the millennium. At this time the lost will be caused to understand the issues likewise and what they have rejected. At this time the ultimate rewards are given: eternal life in a renovated earth, or eternal death. Dan. 8:14 The interpretation that the 2300 days terminated on October 22, 1844, led the Adventists to the conclusion that the day of God’s final judgment began at that time. At the appearing of Christ the decisions of the judgment will be carried into effect. An appropriate designation for this phase of the judgment would be<br>
executive. The determination of the sentence of judgment, which precedes the Second Advent, could be spoken of as investigative. <br>
                           <br>
2. The three phases of judgment represented in vision. Dan. 7:9, 10, 13, 14 Daniel’s vision of a court session in heaven judging the deeds of men. Christ receives His kingdom and His people at its close. Investigative phase. Rev. 20:4; Redeemed engaged in the review phase in heaven during their 1 Cor. 6:2, 3 millennial reign with Christ. Rev. 20:11-15; Executive phase of judgment on the earth at the close of the Matt. 25:31-46 millennium. <br>
                           <br>
3. Classes of persons. The three phases of judgment noted above suggest that there are really three classes of persons who will come into final judgment: <br>
(1) the genuine believer in God, <br>
(2) the false, 39 professing believer, <br>
(3) the rejecter of God’s grace. Just as the ritual of the Day of Atonement in Israel’s sanctuary figuratively removed the confessed sins of only the truly penitent, so the first phase of judgment in heaven will remove and blot out the recorded sins of all who are truly in union with Jesus and are clothed in His righteousness. It is an audit therefore of the Book of Life. But not all professors of God are genuine. (Matt. 22:10.) Thus the investigative phase of judgment in heaven will <br>
(1) remove false from true. (Matt. 22:11-14; Ex. 32:33) <br>
(2) This phase of judgment gives Jesus, our high priest and advocate (1 John 2:1), the opportunity to reaffirm the salvation status of the genuine believer before the angels and loyal universe. (Rev. 3:5) Thus Christ’s last priestly ministry is in behalf of His genuine followers, certifying their acceptance as their records give evidence to all of their union with Him. <br>
                           <br>
4. The records of judgment. <br>
a. God is acquainted with those who have responded to Him. Rev. 20:12 The Book of Life. Rev. 21:27 Only those whose names are retained in the Book of Life will enter heaven. “The book of life contains the names of all who have ever entered the service of God.” (GC 480) As indicated in Zech. 13:6, PK 376, and other places, people can be saved who have no knowledge of Jesus or the written law of God. These people are “honest in heart” and respond to the Holy Spirit. <br>
b. God is not forgetful of the good deeds and purposes of the lives of His followers. Mal. 3:16 A book of remembrance. <br>
c. God is acquainted with the sins which men commit. Eccl. 12:14 Every work and every secret thing is known in the judgment. <br>
                           <br>
5. Christ’s place in the judgment. Acts 17:30, 31 God will judge all men by Jesus Christ. John 5: 22, 27 The Father has given all judgment to Christ. <br>
                           <br>
6. The standard of judgment. John 3:36 The determining factor which decides the destinies of men will be their personal attitude toward Jesus Christ. Eccl. 12:13, 14 One’s personal attitude toward Christ involves obedience to the commandments of God. (John 14:15, 21; 15:10) 7. The judgment-hour message. Rev. 14:6, 7 A worldwide, last-day message is to proclaim the time of God’s judgment. 40 When, after the Great Disappointment of 1844, the Adventists, on the basis of their interpretation of Dan. 8:14, arrived at the conclusion that the cleansing of the sanctuary pointed to the final work of Christ in heaven they began to proclaim the message: “The hour of his judgment is come.” Notes:</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The promise of the Second Coming. John 14:1-3 Before leaving this world Christ made a definite promise that He would return. Acts 1:9-11 The promise was repeated at the time of the ascension. Rev. 22:20 Christ repeated His promise to the apostle John some 65 years after His ascension—“I come quickly.” The doctrine of the Second Advent occupies a position of primary importance in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, where it is estimated that there are 318 references to it in the 260 chapters. The hope of the advent of Christ in His glory was anticipated also by saints of Old Testament times, centuries before the first advent. It has been the hope of the ages. <br>
                           <br>
2. The manner of Christ’s return. Matt. 24:23-26 Christ stressed the importance of our knowing how He will return. Why? Matt. 24:27, 30, 31 Christ’s coming will be of such a character that it cannot be mistaken or counterfeited. Acts 1:9-11 He will come personally and visibly in a cloud as He went away. Rev. 1:7 All who are living on the earth at that time will see Christ return. Christ “cometh with clouds.” “Every eye shall see him.” Those who crucified Christ will be raised just previous to His coming in order to see Him appear as Christ told them at the time they condemned Him to death. (Matt. 26:64; Dan. 12:2) This is called the special resurrection. Matt. 25:31; 24:31 All the heavenly angels will accompany Christ. Matt. 16:27; Luke 9:26 The Second Advent will be an event of magnificent glory. <br>
                           <br>
3. Events connected with the Second Advent. a. The righteous dead will be raised. (1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:22, 23) b. The righteous living will be made immortal, and caught up with those who are resurrected to meet Christ in the air. ( 1 Thes. 4:17; 1 Cor. 15:51-53; Matt. 24:31) c. Those who reject Him will be destroyed by the brightness of Christ’s appearing. (Luke 17:26-30; 2 Thes. 1:7-10; Rev. 6:14-17; 2 Thes. 2:8) d. The earth will be devastated by the seven last plagues as well as by the impact of Christ’s coming. (Rev. 16; 6:14-17; Isa. 24:4-6, 9-22.) 42 <br>
                           <br>
4. Warnings and admonitions in view of the Second Advent. Matt. 24:44 Be ready. Mark 13:32-37 Watch and Pray. 1 Thes. 5:1-6 Let us not sleep in spiritual things. 1 Thes. 5:23 Be sanctified, or holy, in life. Notes:<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The nearness of the Second Advent can be known. Matt. 24:3 The disciples inquired, “What shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” Matt. 24 Jesus answered their inquiry by outlining a series of signs leading up to the end. Matt. 24: 32-35 By observing the signs we are to know when Christ’s coming is near. Matt. 24:36 The day and hour of Christ’s appearance have not been revealed. <br>
                           <br>
2. Signs in the national world. Matt. 24:6, 7 Strife will exist among nations. <br>
                           <br>
3. Signs in the social world. Matt. 24:12 Iniquity shall abound “because wickedness is multiplied.” (R.S.V.) 2 Tim. 3:1-5 Prevailing wickedness will be widespread under a form of godliness. <br>
                           <br>
4. Signs in the religious world. 2 Tim. 3:5 Men will practice the forms of religion but fail to manifest its power in their lives. Matt. 24:11 Many false prophets shall arise. Matt. 24: 23, 26 Reports will be made that Christ has appeared. 1 Tim. 4:1 Many will be influenced by evil spirits. Rev. 13:3, 8 All the world will render homage to the power of papal Rome except those whose names are in the Book of Life. Matt. 24:9, 10 The righteous will be persecuted. Matt. 24:14 The message of Christ’s kingdom will be sounded in all the world. (Rev. 14:6, 7) 2 Peter 3:3, 4 Men will scoff at the message of Christ’s return. <br>
                           <br>
5. Signs in the physical world. The Scriptures foretell three great events in the history of the physical world that are to act as signposts of the Christian era, by which it may be known where man is living in the course of history. Matt. 24:21, 22, 29 A period of great tribulation would be followed quickly by signs in the heavens. 44 Note: “Those days” of tribulation mentioned in verses 22 and 29 are referred to in Revelation 12:6, 13, 14 as a period of 1260 days, or 1260 years, for a day in prophecy is used for a year. (Eze. 4:6; Num. 14:34) This period of persecution has reference to the time of papal supremacy, stretching from the establishment of the papal power in 538 to its overthrow in 1798. Although the “days” do not end until 1798, persecution had generally ceased by the middle of the eighteenth century. For the elect’s sake the days were shortened. Mark 13:24 The darkening of the sun was to occur “in those days, after that tribulation,” i.e., between 1750 and 1798. Rev. 6:12, 13 The Dark Day was to be preceded by a great earthquake and followed by falling stars. Note: The divine order is as follows: (1) great earthquake, (2) dark day, (3) falling stars. History testifies to the fulfillment of the prophecy. The Great Earthquake—Lisbon, November 1, 1755. The Dark Day—May 19, 1780. The Falling Stars—November 13, 1833. <br>
                           <br>
6. Other signs of the last days. Luke 21:25 “The sea and the waves roaring”—that is, distressful conditions among the nations. Matt. 24:7 Famines and pestilences (plagues or rampant, widespread diseases). 7. The need for preparation. Matt. 24:43 Christ exhorts us to watch and be ready. Matt. 25:1-13 If we do not watch, we may leave our preparation for Christ’s return until too late. Notes:<br>

                        <span class="blogsubject">Lesson 24 - The Millennium</span>
                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. Meaning of the word. The word millennium is not used in Scripture. It means simply “1,000 years” (mille = a thousand; annus = a year), and may therefore be applied to the period of 1,000 years of Revelation 20. <br>
                           <br>
2. The righteous during the millennium. Rev. 20:4 “Judgment was given unto them… and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” John 14:1-3 Christ will come the second time so that His people might be with Him. 1 Thes. 4:16 When Christ comes again those of His saints who are sleeping in death are resurrected to be with Him. 1 Thes. 4:17 At the same time the righteous living are translated and along with the resurrected ones are taken from the earth to be “with the Lord.” It is therefore clear that the righteous are not to be with Christ until His second advent, and therefore the millennium must be a period which follows that event. Rev. 20:4-6 The righteous will live and reign with Christ for a thousand years. Doubtless the place where they reign with Him is in heaven. <br>
                           <br>
3. The unrighteous during the millennium. The question now arises as to the unbelievers during the millennium. Rev. 20:6 The unbelieving dead are not raised when Christ comes, for “the first resurrection” brings life only to the “blessed and holy.” “They that are Christ’s” are raised at His second advent. Since the unbelieving dead are not raised at Christ’s coming, they remain in their graves together with the wicked who were slain by the glory of the Advent. Thus the unbelieving dead “[live] not again until the thousand years [are] finished.” (Rev. 20:5) <br>
                           <br>
4. Satan during the millennium. During the millennium Satan is bound in the bottomless pit. Rev. 20:1-3 Whatever “the bottomless pit” represents, it is clearly the place of Satan’s punishment. Eze. 28:17, 18 Satan will be punished on the earth. 46 Rev. 16:17-21 The seven last plagues will have previously desolated the surface of the earth. Jer. 4:23-27 “The whole land shall be desolate.” This terrible scene of the “Day of the Lord” on Judah reflects by extension an ultimate fulfillment of the final Day of the Lord on an impenitent world. 5. Events at the close of the millennium. Rev. 20:5 The rest of the dead (i.e., the wicked) are raised at the close of the millennium. This will be the resurrection of damnation. (John 5:28, 29) Rev. 20:7 Satan is now “loosed” because he can continue his work of deception. He was “bound” by being unable to act. Rev. 20:3 Satan’s liberty after the millennium will be short-lived. Rev. 20:8 Satan works among the nations to urge them to battle. He deceives them with the belief that they can conquer the saints. Rev. 20:9 He incites them to attack the New Jerusalem. Note: Since at the close of the millennium the saints are in the New Jerusalem and it is on earth, it must have descended with the saints at the close of the 1,000 years. (Rev. 21:2) Rev. 20:11-15 The executive judgment takes place, bringing an end of sin, sinners, and the effect of sin. Rev. 21:1 A new heaven and a new earth. Notes:<br>

1. The promise of a future home. 2 Peter 3:13 There will be a new earth inhabited by a righteous people. <br>
                           <br>
2. The new earth has been the hope of the saints. 1 Peter 1:3-5 The living hope of the Christian is fastened upon an inheritance that is incorruptible, undefiled, and eternal. It centers in heaven because God is its creator, but the abode of the redeemed is ultimately in a renewed earth. <br>
                           <br>
3. The reality of the future life. Isa. 65:21-25 Isaiah spoke of man’s future home as a place of reality where there will be projects, home life, and development. Rev. 21:1-5 Sin and its effects will not exist in the new earth. Rev. 21:9-27 A description of the New Jerusalem. Take note of modern translations that provide modern interpretations of measurements. Rev. 22:1, 2 The redeemed will have eternal life. Apparently the tree of life is used to maintain that life and to restore the race to God’s original design. Isa. 35 A picture of the better land. <br>
                           <br>
4. Christ the king of the new earth. Dan. 2:44 All earthly kingdoms will pass away. Rev. 22:4 The redeemed are given the blessed assurance of seeing Christ. Rev. 21:1 New heaven and new earth. Notes:</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

1. A prophetic declaration. <br>
a. God revealed future events to King Nebuchadnezzar. (Dan. 2:1-45.) <br>
b. The king was shown events of the last days. (Dan. 2:28, 45 last part.) “In one night God revealed the history of over 2,500 years, and what the human historian requires volumes to explain is given in fifteen verses.” The Story of Daniel the Prophet, S. N. Haskell. <br>
c. God helped Daniel reveal the dream and give the interpretation. (Dan. 2:14-30.) <br>
d. Note the description of the image of the dream. (Dan. 2:31-35.) <br>
e. Each part of the image represented a kingdom. (Dan. 2:36-43.) <br>
(1) Babylon 605-538 B.C. Head of Gold <br>
(2) Medo-Persia 538-331 B.C. Arms and breast of silver <br>
(3) Grecia 331-168 B.C. Thighs and belly of brass <br>
(4) Rome 168 B.C. - A.D. 476 Legs of iron <br>
(5) Kingdoms of Europe Feet of iron and clay <br>
(6) Great stone Christ’s kingdom <br>
                           <br>
2. Explanation and dates of the periods of the great image. <br>
a. Babylon: Head of gold. 605-538 B.C. (Dan. 2:36-38) “It was the golden kingdom of a golden age. Babylon, its metropolis, towered to a height never reached by any of its successors…In their feeling of security lay the source of their danger. “The soldiers of Cyrus first made known their presence in the city by falling upon the royal guards in the vestibule of the palace of the king. Belshazzar soon became aware of the cause of the disturbance, and died fighting for his life.” Daniel and Revelation, Uriah Smith, pp. 42, 45, 48, 1944 ed., hardcover. <br>
b. Medo-Persia: Breast and arms of silver. 538-331 B.C. (Dan. 2:39) <br>
c. Grecia: Belly and thighs of brass. 331-168 B.C. (Dan. 2:39) “When Darius died [the last king of the Medo-Persians] Alexander [the Great of Greece] saw the field cleared of his last formidable foe… He encouraged such excessive drinking among his followers that on one occasion twenty of them died as the result of their carousal. At length, having sat through one long drinking spree, he was immediately invited to another… He was seized with a violent fever, of which he died eleven days later, June 13, 323 B.C., while yet he stood only at the threshold of mature life, in the thirty-second year of his age.” Ibid., 53. <br>
d. Rome: Legs of iron. 168 B.C. - A.D. 476 (Dan. 2:40) Describing the Roman conquests, Gibbon uses the very imagery employed in the vision of Daniel 2: “The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the ocean; and the images of gold, silver or brass that might serve to represent the nations and their kings were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome.”-- A History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon, Chapter 38, paragraph 1 under “General Observations,” at the close of the chapter. <br>
e. Ten Kingdoms of Europe: Toes mixed with iron and clay. (Dan. 2:41-43) As iron and clay do not mix, so the territory of the former Roman empire has not been successfully reunited since that time. Even the efforts of recent years through the European Union show how accurate God’s predictions are. “These ten kingdoms came into existence in the territory of the Roman Empire between A.D. 351 and 476. They were the result of the barbarian invasions of those times. The kingdoms were as follows: The Alemanni (Germany), the Franks (France), the Burgundians (Switzerland), the Suevi (Portugal), the Saxons (England), the Ostrogoths (part of Italy), the Heruli (part of Italy), the Visigoths (Spain), and the Lombards (Italy).” Our Lord’s Return, C. B. Haynes, p. 22. Iron is not mixed with clay. (Dan. 2:43): <br>
(1) Attempts were made to unite the nations of Europe by marriage. <br>
(2) Attempts have been made in the past to unite the nations of Europe by conquest. <br>
(3) Most recent unification efforts have involved market, currency and politically based European Union. <br>
f. The Stone: Setting up of God’s kingdom—eternity. (Dan. 2:44, 45) <br>
                           <br>
3. The fulfillment. <br>
a. What is the answer of history to this prophetic declaration? <br>
b. When will God set up His kingdom? (Dan. 2:44, 45) <br>
c. In view of the coming kingdom, what should we do? (2 Peter 3:13, 14) Notes:<br>

1. Prophecy and history. <br>
a. Note the description of the vision of Daniel recorded in chapter 7, verses 1-7. <br>
b. In prophecy God sometimes uses symbols: <br>
(1) Winds: strife Jer. 25:31; 49:36, 37 <br>
(2) Waters: peoples and multitudes Rev. 17: 15 <br>
(3) Beasts: kings and kingdoms Dan. 7:17, 23 <br>
c. The animals of Daniel 7 represent kingdoms. <br>
(1) The lion (first kingdom). (Dan. 7:4) “The lion with eagle’s wings represented Babylon, corresponding to the head of gold in Daniel 2… So Babylon was the glory of the kingdom. However, the wings were to be plucked, and it was to stand on its feet as a man and be given a man’s heart… Babylon went down on a night of women and wine, feasting and reveling.” (Dan. 5) God Speaks to Modern Man, Arthur E. Lickey. <br>
(2) The bear (second kingdom). (Dan. 7:5) “The bear symbolized Medo-Persia. It raised itself on one side. It was a dual monarchy of Medes and Persians. One power was stronger than the other. (see Dan. 8:3, 20) It was a cruel and bloodthirsty power. The three ribs well represent the triple alliance of Babylon, Libya, and Egypt, against which the bear fought. This is the silver of Dan. 2.” Ibid., 312. <br>
(3) The leopard (third kingdom). (Dan. 7:6) “The leopard with four heads and four wings is Grecia. The extra wings indicated the rapidity of Alexander’s conquests. He conquered Medo-Persia in five years, and in eight years marched his soldiers over 5,100 miles (8,200 km.)… The four heads stand for the four divisions of the empire made after Alexander’s death, which followed a drunken debauch. His empire was soon divided among his four leading generals: Cassander Macedonia and Greece in the west Lysimachus Thrace and Asia in the north Ptolemy Egypt, Lydia, Arabia, Palestine south Seleucus Syria, Bactria and all the east <br>
(4) The fourth beast (the fourth kingdom). (Dan. 7:7, 23) “The dreadful beast represents Rome. The iron kingdom of Daniel 2 is here a beast with great iron teeth.” Ibid., 313. <br>
(5) The ten horns represent the kingdoms of Europe and match with the ten toes of the image in Daniel 2. The ten horns represent ten kings or kingdoms (Dan. 7:17, 23) “So ten main kingdoms were to arise out of Rome’s empire. The main modern nations of Europe are the outgrowth of these divisions. They can never be permanently united by men.” Ibid., 313. <br>
                           <br>
2. The fourth beast and the little horn. <br>
a. Note the character of the fourth kingdom. (Dan. 7:7, 19, 23) b. The horns of the fourth beast were peculiar, and a change takes place among them. (Dan. 7:7, 8, 24) <br>
(1) A small horn came up after the ten horns. (Dan. 7:24) 51 “The little horn was to come up after the ten horns were in evidence. So it did. The roots of the papacy were there, but it rose to power and prominence after Rome’s division.” Ibid., 314. <br>
(2) It came up among the ten horns. (Dan. 7:8) “This power must come up among the ten horns, that is, in the European region. The papacy rose with its seat at Rome itself.” Ibid., 314. <br>
(3) This horn has power to exercise against the saints. (Dan. 7:21, 25) “The little horn represents papal Rome, or the papacy. All students of history know that Rome had two phases: pagan (heathen) and papal Rome. When pagan Rome fell under the invasion of the barbarian tribes the Bishop of Rome picked up the scepter. Christianity was nominally accepted by the barbarians in general, and the pope became the chief power in Europe… All historians, both Catholic and Protestant, know that, following the breakup of pagan Rome, the papacy, or papal Rome, became the outstanding force among the kingdoms of Europe. There is simply no other power which answers to the ten points set forth by Daniel.” Ibid., 314. <br>
                           <br>
3. The eternal kingdom. All power and dominion will at last be given to Christ. (Dan. 7:13, 14, 26, 27.) “All who keep the commandments of God will enter in through the gates into the city and have right to the tree of life and ever be in the presence of the lovely Jesus, whose countenance shines brighter than the sun at noonday.” (Early Writings 51) Notes:<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Wednesday, April 05, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The Bible notes that there are two basic kinds of law: physical law and moral law. All nature operates under physical laws. Plants yield seed and fruit in harmony with fixed laws. (Gen. 1:11) Sun, moon, and stars move in precise orbits according to the arrangement and design of the divine will. (Gen. 1:14-18) Landing men on the moon would not have been possible without a knowledge of and cooperation with the physical laws God designed to govern the universe. There would be immediate chaos if physical law were violated. God has placed all intelligent beings He has created not only under physical law but also under moral law. Moral law expresses the will of the Creator for these intelligent beings because He has given to each the ability to make moral choices between right and wrong. Violation of moral law brings moral chaos such as occurred in the time before the Flood and in the great sin and degradation of end-time humanity. <br>
                           <br>
1. The Ten Commandments Ex. 20:1-17 God has expressed moral law to humankind in the form of the Ten Commandments. Rom. 7:12 God’s law is just and good; it is not burdensome to man. It shows 1 John 5:2, 3 us the happiest way to live. Eccl. 12:13 The Ten Commandments express “the whole duty of man.” The first table (precepts 1-4) defines his duty to God; the second table (precepts 5-10) defines his duty to his fellow beings. <br>
                           <br>
2. The Nature of the Ten Commandments Ps. 119:96 Although the law of God is brief, it is comprehensive, covering in principle all aspects of human living. <br>
                           <br>
3. God and the Commandments 1 Pet. 1:16; The Ten Commandments are a reflection of God’s Rom. 7:12; character. Thus the principles upon which they rest are Rev. 15:3; Ps. 25:8 unchangeable. Rom. 7:14 The law of God is spiritual; that is, it tests and weighs the Matt. 5:21, 22, thoughts and motives of the mind where sin originates (Mark 7:21 &amp; 27, 28 23) as well as our outward acts. 1 John 4:8 God’s character is one of love. Thus the precepts of His law Matt. 22: 36-40 rest on the principle of love: supreme love to God and unselfish love to one’s fellowman. This means that each precept of the Ten Commandments has a positive side as well as a 53 negative one. For example, “Thou shalt not kill” means not only that the Christian will not murder another human being, but also that he will seek in every way possible to promote the life and well-being of his fellowman. <br>
a. First table: Gen. 35:1-4; 2:1-3 Since God is eternal (Ps. 90:2), it is clear that the principles of supreme love to the Creator and unselfish love to fellow beings always existed and always will exist. Those principles are expressed in the Ten Commandments. <br>
b. Second table: Gen. 18:19; 4:8-11 The evidence from Genesis shows that the precepts of this law were Gen. 39:7-9; 19:1-10 known orally from the very beginning of human existence. Many Gen. 44:8; 12:11-13 centuries would pass before it would be necessary to speak them again and write them on tables of stone. <br>
                           <br>
4. The function of the Ten Commandments 1 John 3:4; Rom. 7:7 The Holy Spirit uses the law to convict us of sin and our lost condition. This convicting function of the law helps us to sense our need of Christ, who alone can save us from our sins. Rom. 2:17, 18; The law also functions to continually teach us our Father’s will. Ps. 40:8 Thus it serves as a guide to Christian living, a compass of absolutes by which we check our course through life. <br>
                           <br>
5. The Inward Law Heb. 8:8-10; God desires not only to forgive our sins but also to write His law in Isa. 51:7 our hearts. That is, He desires to make the Ten Commandments our inward law—to train the conscience to be sensitive to His authority in all things. Rom. 13:8-10; God makes the moral law of the Ten Commandments our inward Gal. 5:14, 22 law by implanting love in our hearts for Him and our fellow beings. He who loves God supremely will naturally desire to obey the first four precepts. And if he loves others as himself, he will obey the last six and their comprehensive applications. James 2:8-12 The judgment will determine whether God’s law and its principle Matt. 25:31-46 of love have become a living reality in the lives of human beings who are subjects of the Sovereign of earth and universe. John 15:1-8 The inward law becomes a reality to those who are in union with Jesus Christ.<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The origin of the Sabbath. Mark 2:27 The Sabbath was made for man, that is, mankind. It is not a national institution. Gen. 2:1-3 It was made at the close of the creation week by three distinct acts of God—resting, blessing, and sanctifying. <br>
                           <br>
2. The Sabbath from creation to Sinai. Ex. 16:22-26 The Israelites were observers of the Sabbath before the Ten Commandments were proclaimed from Sinai. (The story of the manna.) Ex. 20:8-11 A commandment to reverence the Sabbath was placed in the heart of the Decalogue when Israel was established as God’s nation. Notice that the Sabbath is not introduced as something new at Sinai, but men are called upon to “remember” it as an institution with which they are already acquainted. The reason given for Sabbath observance goes back to creation. It was a memorial of the creation of the world. <br>
                           <br>
3. The Sabbath and the nation of Israel. Eze. 20:13 The breaking of the Sabbath in the wilderness journeys of Israel brought God’s displeasure. Isa. 58:13, 14 The Sabbath was God’s holy day and was not to be used for selfish purposes. <br>
                           <br>
4. Important truths taught by the Sabbath. Ex. 20:8-11 The Sabbath is a reminder of God’s creation of the world and thus is the foundation of true worship. We worship and obey our Creator. Ex. 31:13 It served as a constant sign of the sanctifying power of God. It reminded Israel that they were to be a holy people. The God who created man is able to re-create him, thus sanctifying or separating him from rebellion. Ex. 20:2 The Sabbath was the sign to Israel that Jehovah was God. Notes:<br>

1. Christ and the Sabbath. Luke 4:16 It was Christ’s custom to observe the Sabbath. Mark 2:28 He called Himself the Lord of the Sabbath. Matt. 12:9-14 He healed the man with the withered hand. “Lawful to do well.” Matt. 24:20 Christ taught His followers to keep the Sabbath in mind after His death. Luke 23:50-56 In harmony with the nature of the Sabbath as a day of rest, Christ rested in the tomb on the Sabbath day. He rested from His completed work for man’s redemption as He had from His completed work at creation. <br>
                           <br>
2. The disciples and the Sabbath. Matt. 28:1 “Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week.” (R.S.V.) (See also Mark 16:1) The resurrection occurred after the Sabbath ended. Luke 23:50-56 The followers of Jesus observed the Sabbath “according to the commandment” while Christ was in the tomb. Luke 24:1 They regarded the first day of the week as an ordinary day. It is clear that Jesus had given them no instruction about a change from the Sabbath to the first day of the week. Paul made no mention of any change in regard to the Sabbath in his frequent contact with the Jews and Gentiles. (Acts 13:14, 42- 44; 16:13; 17:1, 2; 18:1-4, 11) Rev. 1:10 John, about A.D. 95, shows that Christians looked upon a certain day as “the Lord’s day.” Note: Scripture warrants us in applying the title “Lord’s Day” only to the seventh day of the week. (Mark 2:28; Isa. 58:13; Ex. 20:11) Notes:<br>

1. The first day of the week in the Old Testament. No particular importance is attached to the first day of the week in the Old Testament. In the creation week there is nothing to distinguish it above the other days of the week. (Gen. 1:3-5) It was viewed as one of the “six working days.” (Eze. 46:1) <br>
                           <br>
2. The first day of the week in the New Testament. Many people are of the opinion that Christ and His disciples changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week. Others believe that the Sabbath was dropped as a day of worship after Christ’s death and that the first-century Christians began the observance of Sunday in its place. In this lesson we shall examine all the references to the first day of the week in the New Testament to see if there is any indication of a religious regard for that day in New Testament times. The word Sunday is not found in the Bible. The Jews had a name for only one day of the week—Sabbath, all other were simply numbered. Some languages today, such as Portuguese, continue that tradition with a name for Sabbath (Sabado) and Sunday (Domingo). Monday is called “Second Market-day” (Segunda Feira), etc., with Sunday having been once considered “First Market-day.” Matt. 28:1 The expression “In the end of the Sabbath” (K.J.V.) is rendered “After the Sabbath” in the Revised Standard Version. (See how other languages translate this phrase in various versions.) The text shows that the first day of the week follows the Sabbath and was not regarded as a rest day or day of worship by the women who believed in Jesus. Mark 16:1, 2 Similar to Matt. 28:1. Mark 16:9 States that Christ rose in the early morning of the first day of the week. Luke 24:1 Luke’s account of the visit to the tomb of Jesus on the early morning of the first day. John 20:1 John’s account. John’s Gospel was the last to be written; it was composed in the nineties of the first century. John 20:19 John uses no religious title for the first day of the week. The gathering of the disciples mentioned in this verse was not for worship. John is doubtless using Roman time here. Acts 20:7 This is the only place in the New Testament which mentions a religious meeting on the first day of the week. As the meeting was held on the dark part of the first day of the week, it would be held on what we now call Saturday night. Paul was traveling to Jerusalem and continued his journey next morning. It is evident from the record that this upper-room session was not a regular meeting reflecting apostolic custom, inasmuch as it extended through the night (verses 57 7-11). The meeting was a farewell meeting. 1 Cor. 16:2 See other translations of this verse. Note that the setting aside money for donations was a private occasion. Notes: <br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. A change of the Sabbath indicated in prophecy. Dan. 7:25 The prophet Daniel spoke of a power that would presume to be able to change “the times and the law.” (R.S.V.) Ex. 20:3-17 The only part of the Decalogue that deals with time is the Sabbath commandment. <br>
                           <br>
2. The little-horn symbol identified. The power that would attempt to change the times and the law of God is symbolized in Daniel’s prophecy by a “little horn.” This little-horn power can be clearly identified as the papacy. (See Lesson 26) 2 Thes. 2:3, 4 Prophecy foretold an apostasy of the church resulting in the development of a “man of sin” (doubtless the little horn of Dan. 7:8 with eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke great things.) <br>
                           <br>
3. The claims of the papacy. <br>
a. The papacy claims the right to change or abrogate divine requirements. The following extract gives a clear statement of papal claims. “The pope is, as it were, God on earth, sole sovereign of the faithful of Christ, chief king of kings, having plenitude of power, to whom has been entrusted by Almighty God direction not only of the earthly but also of the heavenly kingdom. “The pope is of so great authority and power that he can modify, explain, or interpret even divine laws. “The pope can modify divine law, since his power is not of man but of God, and he acts as a vicegerent of God upon earth, with most ample power of binding and loosing his sheep.” Ecclesiastical Dictionary, Ferrarias. article “Papa,” Rome, 1890. <br>
b. The papacy claims that by virtue of this right she has changed the Sabbath. “It was the Catholic Church which, by the authority of Jesus Christ, has transferred this rest to the Sunday in remembrance of the resurrection of our Lord. Thus the observance of Sunday by the Protestants is an homage they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the [Catholic] church.” Plain Truth About the Protestantism of Today, Mgr. Segur, 213, Boston: Thomas B. Noonan &amp; Co., 1868. Imprimatur, Joannes Josephus. “Ques. Which is the Sabbath day? “Ans. Saturday is the Sabbath day. “Ques. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday? “Ans. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church in Council of Laodicea (A.D. 336) transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.”<br>
The Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine, Rev. Peter Geierman, C. SS. R., 50, 2nd edition, 1910. 59 “Ques. Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals or precepts? “Ans. Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.”<br>
A Doctinal Catechism, Rev. Stephen Keenan; approved by the Most Reverend John Hughes, D.D., Archbishop of New York, page 174. New York: Edward Dunigan &amp; Brother, 1851. <br>
c. A study of Roman Catholic catechisms reveals the fact that the Roman Catholic Church has made three drastic changes in the Ten Commandments: <br>
(1) The second commandment has been entirely omitted or viewed as part of the first. <br>
(2) The tenth commandment has been divided into two in order to make the full number of ten. <br>
(3) The fourth commandment, called the third, is so changed in its reading that it no longer defines which day is the Sabbath, and is then applied to Sunday. Notes: <br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. The sealing of God’s servants. Rev. 7:1-3 Before the final judgments of God fall upon the earth, the servants of God are to be sealed with “the seal of the living God.” <br>
                           <br>
2. The seal of the living God. Clearly the seal of God in the vision of Revelation 7 is a symbol of ownership. Those who are sealed are God’s special people. The placing of God’s seal upon the forehead signifies God’s recognition of those sealed as His own possession. Rev. 7:4 The company of the sealed of the last days are called the 144,000. Rev. 14:1 The seal of God in the forehead is equivalent to the name of God in the forehead. As God’s name signifies His character, it is obvious that only those are sealed who manifest the character of God in their lives. Ex. 31:13 An outward sign of a sanctified person is the keeping of the Sabbath, the seal in God’s law. (Eze. 20:12) A person who is truly sanctified in his life will “remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,” when he understands that the Sabbath is God’s holy day. Rev. 14:6, 7 God’s final message to the world calls attention to God as the creator. Since the Sabbath is the memorial of creation, this final message doubtless calls men to the observance of the true Sabbath. Rev. 14:12 Christians of the last days keep the commandments of God. <br>
                           <br>
3. The mark of the beast. Rev. 14:9-11 At the same time that the faithful are receiving the seal of God another group are receiving the “mark of the beast.” Rev. 16:1, 2 Those who receive the mark of the beast will suffer the seven last plagues. Rev. 13:11-17 The mark of the beast is enforced by another beast power, likened to a lamb with a dragon’s voice. In order to determine what is meant by “the mark of the beast,” it is necessary to identify the power referred to as “the beast.” Rev. 13:1 The beast has ten horns. This identifies him with the fourth beast of Daniel 7, which is declared to be “the fourth kingdom upon the earth” from Babylon’s day. (Dan. 7:23) This beast (Rev. 13:1) has the same characteristics as the little horn of Daniel 7. (Read Rev. 13:1-7) The beast-power must, therefore, refer to Rome, and as its work reaches to the last days of earth’s history, it is evident that it must symbolize Rome in its papal form; i.e., the papacy. 61 Rev. 13:6, 7 The character specifications of the beast are met in the papacy. Rev. 13:5 The special period of papal supremacy was to last for 42 months, or 1260 days (years). From the expulsion of the Ostrogoths from Rome in A.D. 538, leaving the pope free under the Emperor Justinian to act as head of all the churches, to 1798, when the pope was dethroned and the papacy controlled by the French, is a period of 1260 years. Rev. 13:3 The papacy received a deadly wound in 1798 when Napoleon Bonaparte ordered its abolition. But the deadly wound was to be healed and all the world come again under papal influence. Despite Napoleon’s orders a new pope was elected in 1800 and the papacy was revived. In the twentieth century it has renewed power and influence which are felt throughout the whole world. Rev. 13:11, 12 Through the influence of another power the earth is to “worship the first beast.” It is not within the purpose of this lesson to enter into a detailed study of the prophetic symbols. From early in their history Seventh-day Adventists have interpreted the two-horned beast of Revelation 13:11-17 as apostate Protestantism, particularly as it appears in the United States of America. The reasons for this may be found in such books as The Great Controversy, Daniel and the Revelation, and Bible Readings for the Home. Rev. 13:14, 15 The two-horned beast makes an image to the first beast. An image of the beast would be a system similar to the papacy. Such a system would doubtless be a church-state organization or a religio-political power that would seek to coerce men in respect to their manner of worship. Rev. 13:16, 17 This church-state system, the image of the beast, uses a certain mark or sign of allegiance to show its authority, and persecutes all who refuse to receive this sign. Since the sign of obedience to a dictatorial state system is called “the mark of the beast,” and since the beast is the papacy, the mark must be something which constitutes a special recognition of papal religion. <br>
                           <br>
4. The people of God victorious. Rev. 14:9-11 The message of the third angel warns us against receiving the mark of the beast. Rev. 13:8 Some refuse to worship the beast. Rev. 15:2-4 Glorious victory will come to those who refuse to worship the beast or receive his mark. Rev. 16:2 The plagues will fall on those who receive the mark of the beast. 62 Two groups are contrasted in the third angel’s message (Rev. 14:9-14): <br>
(1) The worshipers of the beast and its image (verse 9) and <br>
(2) the saints, the true worshipers of God. (verse 12). <br>
Both are professed worshipers of God. The saints are identified as “they that keep the commandments of God.” But the other group—as professed Christians—would make a similar claim. Therefore, the basic distinction between the two lies in the attitude each shows towards the fourth commandment. The saints observe the Sabbath, the seal of God’s law, thus recognizing God’s authority as the Creator. The worshipers of the beast observe a substitute day, thus acknowledging the authority of the papacy to alter divine laws and to command the conscience. “The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty, for it is the point of truth especially controverted. When the final test shall be brought to bear upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those who serve God and those who serve Him not. While the observance of the false Sabbath in compliance with the law of the state, contrary to the fourth commandment, will be an avowal of allegiance to a power that is in opposition to God, the keeping of the true Sabbath, in obedience to God’s law, is an evidence of loyalty to the Creator. While one class, by accepting the sign of submission to earthly powers, receive the mark of the beast, the other, choosing the token of allegiance to divine authority, receive the seal of God.” (GC 605) Notes:</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

1. A divine plan. <br>
a. Jesus said He would build His church on the great Truth of Peter’s confession. (Matt. 16:18) <br>
b. The church founded on Christ. (Eph. 2:18-22) “Human power and human might did not establish the church of God, and neither can they destroy it. Not on the rock of human strength, but on Christ Jesus, the Rock of Ages, was the church founded, ‘and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.’” (PK 595, 596) <br>
c. Jesus showed that He recognized the authority of the church. (Matt. 18:17) <br>
d. The Lord leads us to become members of the church. (Acts 2:47) <br>
                           <br>
2. Instruction and discipline. <br>
a. God has placed gifts of leadership in the church. (Eph. 4:11) <br>
b. The leaders of the church are admonished to care for the flock. (Acts 20:28) <br>
c. Members of the church should submit to the chosen leaders. (Heb. 13:17.) <br>
d. God has given gifts to help the church—apostles, prophets, teachers, miracles. (1 Cor. 12:28) <br>
e. God is the author of order. (1 Cor. 14:33, 40) <br>
f. The church sometimes has to take extreme measures of discipline. (1 Cor. 5:13; Matt. 18:5-17) “No church officer should advise, no committee should recommend, nor should any church vote, that the name of a wrongdoer shall be removed from the church books, until the instruction given by Christ has been faithfully followed. When this instruction has been followed, the church has cleared herself before God.” (7T 262, 263) <br>
g. The church members have special blessings if persecuted. (Matt. 5:11, 12) <br>
                           <br>
3. Proclaiming the gospel. <br>
a. What work has been committed to the church? (Mark 16:15, 16; Matt. 10:1, 7) <br>
b. What special message will the remnant church bear? (Rev. 14:6-12) “The church is God’s appointed agency for the salvation of men. It was organized for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to the world….The church is the repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church will eventually be made manifest, even to the ‘principalities and powers in heavenly places,’ the final and full display of the love of God.” (AA 9) Notes: <br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 25, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. Baptism a Christian ordinance. Baptism is the sacred ordinance at the entrance to the church of God. Matt. 28:19, 20 Baptism is inseparably connected with the gospel commission. Mark 16:15, 16 Baptism is a positive requirement of the gospel. Matt. 3:13-17 Jesus was baptized, not as a confession of sins, but for an example to His followers. <br>
                           <br>
2. The manner of baptism. The only method of baptism revealed in the Bible is baptism by immersion. Matt. 3:5, 6, 13, 16 John the Baptist is the first Bible character known to baptize. John 3:23 It requires much water to baptize. Note: The New Testament writers always used the word baptize when referring to baptism, and this word means “to plunge,” “to dip,” “to immerse.” Two entirely different words are used for sprinkling and pouring: rantizo (“to sprinkle”) and ekcheo (“to pour”). Acts 8:29-39 Philip baptized by immersion. Eph. 4:5 There is only one baptism in the Christian faith. <br>
                           <br>
3. What baptism signifies. Baptism signifies a complete change of character, a death to the old nature, and the acceptance of a new life. Rom. 6:3, 4 Baptism signifies the death and burial of the past life of sin and a resurrection to newness of life in Christ. Rom. 6:6 The old nature must die. Rom. 6:8-11 In baptism the believer signifies that through union with Christ he dies to sin to live a new life. <br>
                           <br>
4. The prerequisites for baptism. Acts 16:30, 31, 33 Faith in Christ as a personal Saviour. Acts 2:38 Repentance is obtained from Christ. Matt. 3:7, 8 Obedience to God’s requirements. Acts 16:31; 8:35-37; Matt. 28:20 Definite instruction concerning the Christian life should precede baptism. <br>
                           <br>
5. The gift of the Spirit. The gift of the Holy Spirit is promised to those who enter into the full significance of this 65 sacred rite. Acts 2:38 The promise to those who are baptized. Mark 1:9-11 Christ received a special baptism of the Spirit at His baptism in the Jordan River. Mark 1:8 John baptized only with water; Christ is to baptize with the Spirit. Acts 10:44-48 Although the Spirit is given before baptism, baptism should not be omitted. Acts 19:1-5 An example of rebaptism by immersion into further light. Through the gift of the Spirit the believer is enabled to live the Christian life. Eph. 3:16, 17 The Spirit strengthens us. Gal. 3:27 The believer has “put on” Christ. Rom. 8:14-16 As the children of God, believers are led by God’s Spirit. Col. 3:1-3 The baptized Christian lives for heavenly things. Notes:<br>

Two important ordinances within the church are the ordinance of humility and the Lord’s Supper. <br>
1. The ordinance of humility. John 13:1-5 Christ’s example of humility and service. This ordinance commemorates His incarnation. Compare the symbolism of His acts in instituting the ordinance (consciousness of His true identity; removal of His outer robe; girding Himself as a servant and serving) with the actual incarnation (in form of God and equal; empties Himself—“makes of no reputation;” takes the form of a servant; dies to provide moral cleansing of sin). John 13; Phil. 2:5-8) John 13:6-11 Peter’s objection. Note the importance which Jesus attached to the washing (verse 8). He used the service of washing Peter’s feet to emphasize the washing from sin, which is essential for fellowship with Himself and with one another. Titus 3:5; John 15:3 The washing of feet was a symbol of a higher cleansing. John 13:12-17 The Savior’s example of humility and service to His followers should be emulated in their attitude toward one another. “This ordinance is Christ’s appointed preparation for the sacramental service. While pride, variance, and strife for supremacy are cherished, the heart cannot enter into fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared to receive the communion of His body and His blood. Therefore it was that Jesus appointed the memorial of His humiliation to be first observed.” (DA 650.) <br>
                           <br>
2. The Lord’s Supper. 1 Cor. 15:2-4 Importance of a knowledge of two fundamental historic facts concerning Christ. 1 Cor. 5:7 In the old dispensation the feast of the Passover kept Christ’s death in mind. 1 Cor. 11:23, 24 The Lord’s Supper is to remind us of Christ’s death. 1 Cor. 11:25 The wine is a symbol of the blood of Christ which ratified the new covenant. The blood represents a life sacrificed for us. 1 Cor. 11:26 Both the bread and the wine commemorate Christ’s death. 1 Cor. 11:27, 29 It is a solemn thing to participate in the ordinances. 1 Cor. 11:28 There is need for self-examination. 1 Cor. 10:16 The partaking of the Lord’s Supper signifies entering into the experience of the gospel. 1 Cor. 11:26 The ordinances instituted by Christ are to continue in the church 67 until the second advent. Matt. 26:26-29 We may regard the Lord’s Supper as a reminder of the great supper to come in God’s kingdom. Notes:<br>

1. God is the rightful owner of this world and of everything in it. Ps. 24:1 God owns the earth and all its possessions. Ps. 50:10-12 Every living thing is the Lord’s. Haggai 2:8 The wealth of the world is God’s. <br>
                           <br>
2. Seeing that man really owns nothing, but is entrusted with God’s goods, his is a position of stewardship. 1 Tim. 6:7 All that we have has been entrusted to us from God. Matt. 25:14 God has delivered to us His goods. Deut. 8:18 God gives man power to get wealth. <br>
                           <br>
3. God has given us clear instructions as to how we may discharge our responsibility as stewards faithfully. Eph. 5:5 The covetous person has no inheritance. Luke 12:15 Beware of covetousness. Deut. 14:22 Israel was to tithe “increase of [their] seed.” Prov. 3:9 We are to honor God with our substance. <br>
                           <br>
4. God claimed a tithe of all the income of the children of Israel for the support of His work. Lev. 27:30-33 All the tithe “is the Lord’s.” Matt. 23:23 Christ, in speaking to the Jews, commended the tithing principle as a divine obligation. <br>
                           <br>
5. The tithing principle existed before the establishment of the nation of Israel and is therefore not simply a Jewish institution. Gen. 14:17-24; Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek. Heb. 7:1, 2 Gen. 28:20-22 Jacob promised to be faithful in tithing. “I will give a tenth.” 1 Cor. 9:11-14 The gospel ministry of the church calls for our financial support just as the Levitical priesthood called for the tithe for its support. Num. 18:20, 21, Israel’s tithe was used to support the priests and Levites as they 26-28 gave full time to the sanctuary service. Tithing is God’s plan for the systematic support of the work of the gospel. <br>
                           <br>
6. God also expects freewill offerings. 69 Ps. 96:8 Offerings are a part of acceptable worship. 2 Cor. 9:7 The true spirit of giving is the thing that counts with God. Deut. 16:16, 17 How to measure our gifts. Acts 20:35 The blessedness of giving. <br>
                           <br>
7. Rich blessings are promised to the faithful stewards of God’s goods, but God cannot so bless the unfaithful. Mal. 3:8-10 When God’s professed people withheld what was due to Him in material things; they were robbing God and came under His displeasure. Matt. 6:19-21 Investment in the bank of heaven is a secure investment. Notes:<br>

1. God communicated His message to the people in Old Testament times by means of the gift of prophecy. Hosea 12:10; God spoke to men by the prophets in ancient times. Heb. 1:1 Amos 3:7 God promises to reveal His secrets by the prophets. 2 Peter 1:21 The prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit. 2 Chron. 20:20 The prosperity of Israel was dependent upon the attitude of the people to God’s prophets. Note: Though it is true that all we have in the Bible came through the ministry of the prophets, it is also true that there were many prominent prophets who made no additions to the Bible. Elijah, Elisha, and others have left us no books. Also, some of the prophets wrote books, but the books they wrote do not form a part of the Scriptures. 2 Chron. 36:14-21 Israel was sent into captivity for refusing to heed the prophets. <br>
                           <br>
2. God did not dispense with the gift of prophecy in New Testament times. After Christ returned to heaven He still used the prophets as His medium of communication. Luke 2:25, 26, 36; Christ was announced by three prophets at His advent. Matt. 11:9 Acts. 11:27, 28; There were prophets in the church after Christ’s ascension to 21:8-11; 13:1 heaven. Rev. 1:1 The last book of the New Testament (along with other books of the New Testament) was written by a prophet. <br>
                           <br>
3. After the close of the apostolic era, the gift of prophecy practically disappeared from the professed church of Christ, for the same reason, doubtless, that it was removed from Israel in earlier times. Eze. 7:26 God removed the gift of prophecy when the people departed from His law. Prov. 29:18 Obedience to the law and clearness of vision go together (“no vision, the people perish”). Dan. 7:25 After the apostles’ day an apostate power (the papacy) led the people away from God’s law. <br>
                           <br>
4. The Bible reveals that the church of the last days will be a commandment-keeping church, and will also possess the gift of prophecy. 71 Rev. 12:17 Two outstanding characteristics of the remnant church—the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus. Rev. 19:10 “The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” Joel 2:28-32 Joel’s prophecy of the gift of prophecy in the last days. Notes:<br>

There is need to test the claims of one professing to exercise the gift of prophecy, because Satan counterfeits the work of God. <br>
                           <br>
1. False methods of communication. a. Deut. 18:9-12 The occult (fortune-telling, spiritualism, etc.) Lev. 20:6, 27 Isa. 47:12-14 b. 1 John 4:1 False prophets. We are to try the spirits. Why? Matt. 24:24 False prophets will appear, especially in the last days. <br>
                           <br>
2. Challenge to distinguish the true from the false. (1 Thes. 5:19-21) 3. Primary Bible tests of a prophet. <br>
a. Isa. 8:19, 20; Matt. 4:4 Harmony with the revealed will of God (Scripture). <br>
b. Matt. 7:15-20 Fruits (results) of the personal life and teachings. (What are the effects on the cause of God and the lives of those who accept?) <br>
c. 1 John 4:1-3 Loyal to all aspects of the Bible’s teaching about Christ. <br>
d. Deut. 18:21, 22; Jer. 28:9 Fulfilled predictions. Note: This test is not conclusive for the following reasons: <br>
(1) Satan, through a false prophet or a medium, may predict something that will happen. (Deut. 13:1-3; 1 Sam. 28:7, 19) <br>
(2) There may be conditional aspects to a prediction made by a true prophet which may cancel its fulfillment. (Jonah 3:4, 10) Apart from these considerations, a true prophet’s prediction will come to pass. (Jer. 28:16, 17) <br>
                           <br>
4. Secondary Bible tests of a prophet. <br>
a. Timeliness of a prophet’s message. (True prophets come at a time of need with a timely message; consider Noah, John the Baptist, the major and minor prophets.) <br>
b. Practical (meets genuine needs; not fanciful.) <br>
c. High spiritual plane (Does not deal with secular matters as modern psychics do, but with sin and righteousness.) <br>
d. Physical phenomena (Dan. 10:8, 17, 18; Num. 24:2-4, 15, 16) Some persons under the inspiration of the Spirit have manifested various physical phenomena. Apparently the Spirit did this to arrest attention. But there is no evidence that this was the experience of every prophet. This feature is not a conclusive test, as physical phenomena could be counterfeited by satanic agencies. <br>
e. Evidence the prophet is not being influenced (see charge made against Jeremiah on this point. Jer. 43:2, 3) <br>
                           <br>
5. Seventh-day Adventists believe that they constitute the remnant church of Revelation 12:17 because they keep the commandments of God. This claim cannot be justified, however, unless they also “have the testimony of Jesus Christ” (Rev. 12:17), which is declared to be the “spirit of prophecy” (Rev. 19:10). These scriptures clearly indicate that there will be a prophet in the remnant church. Seventh-day Adventists believe that from the time when the Sabbath truth was discovered (1844), the Lord has restored the gift of prophecy in His church, and that this gift was manifested through Mrs. Ellen Gould White, formerly Miss Ellen Harmon. It is certain that her life and work stand every test that can be brought to bear upon them. Notes:</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

1. Our bodies are the temples of God because of creation and redemption. 1 Cor. 6:19, 20 Our bodies are not our own, but God’s. <br>
                           <br>
2. Seeing that our bodies belong to God, we are under obligation to keep them jealously for His occupancy. Rom. 12:1 The body is to be yielded to God. <br>
                           <br>
3. The body temple may be defiled in the following ways: Dan. 1:8 By what we eat and drink. Jude 8 By impure thoughts. Lev. 10:8-10 By strong drink. 1 Cor. 6:9, 10 Impure persons and drunkards will not enter heaven. Judges 13:4 God forbids the use of food or drink detrimental to health. “Abstinence from all hurtful food and drink is the fruit of true religion.” (GW 348) <br>
                           <br>
4. The Christian eats, drinks, and acts so as to honor God. (1 Cor. 10:31) 5. The Lord expects us to be sanctified in body for His return. 1 Thes. 5:23 To be sanctified wholly. 2 Cor. 7:1 We are to put away all filthiness of the flesh and spirit. 1 Cor. 9:25-27 Temperance and self-control are necessary in the Christian life. 1 Cor. 9:25 Everyone who strives for mastery is temperate in all things.

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. God is interested in the physical well-being of His people and is not the author of sickness. 3 John 2 It is the Lord’s wish that His followers should be in health. <br>
                           <br>
2. In harmony with God’s purpose that His people should be healthy, He has made definite provision as regards the food which is best suited for man, and has warned him against that which will deprive him of health. Gen. 1:29 Man’s original diet. Gen. 9:3 After the Flood, man was given permission to add flesh to his diet. The permission granted in this verse indicates clearly that flesh was not in the original diet of man. Ex. 16:35 When God provided Israel with food He did not give them a flesh diet. Dan. 1:8-20 Daniel was blessed and honored of God for refusing the highly seasoned flesh foods of the king. <br>
                           <br>
3. Though the Lord permitted man to eat flesh, He has shown clearly that it is not the best food, and has definitely forbidden the use of certain flesh foods. Eccl. 10:17 A guiding principle in the selection of food—eat for strength, not merely to satisfy appetite. Deut. 14:1-21 A divine evaluation of flesh foods. (Lev. 11:1-31) Deut. 14:8 The swine especially forbidden. <br>
                           <br>
4. The Lord is also particular as to what we drink. All injurious drink is strictly forbidden. Prov. 20:1 Wine and strong drink are deceivers. Isa. 28:7 Alcohol takes away a man’s judgment. 1 Cor. 6:9, 10 No drunkard will enter heaven. Hab. 2:15 Christians should not give injurious drinks to others. <br>
                           <br>
5. Since God regards the physical bodies of His children as temples of His Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19, 20), we honor God by rejecting the common use of alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics for physical thrills, or any other substance that would weaken our physical and mental wellbeing.

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
God created humankind as His crowning act of creation. Adam and Eve and their descendants were intended to be the centerpiece of a beautiful planet teeming with animals and plant life of all kinds. <br>
                           <br>
1. Man’s position Gen. 1:26, 27 Humankind especially reflect the “image of God” in their mental capacities to reason, to exercise choice, to love and to fellowship with their maker. (Col. 3:10) Ps. 8:5 As one order of intelligent beings, man was made a little lower than the angels. Gen. 1:28; God entrusted the earth and its resources to the care and rulership Ps. 115:16 of the human family. <br>
                           <br>
2. Man’s nature Gen. 2:7 God created the first person by uniting the “breath of life” (the lifeprinciple) with a body of “dust.” The union of these two produced a “living soul,” that is, a “living person” or a “living being” (as different translators interpret the original). Observe that no independent entity such as an immortal soul or spirit was placed within the first created person. 1 Tim. 6:15, 16 Only Deity has natural or inherent immortality. Since God “only” has inherent immortality, neither Adam nor any of his descendants possess immortality naturally. It is the life-principle from God—sometimes described as “the breath of life” (Gen. 2:7) or the “spirit of God… in my nostrils” (Job 27:3)—that makes possible the whole human person with his mental, spiritual, and physical natures or functions. None of these aspects of the human being are naturally immortal, nor can any of them exist independently apart from the others. Eccl. 12:7; Death is a reversal of the creation process which produced the first human life. Just as the life-principle (breath/spirit) from God united with the dust to create life, so the return of the life-principle (breath/spirit) to God results in death, the cessation of life. Gen. 2:17; 3:22 God intended for the human family to live endlessly. Such an endless life was dependent, however, upon their obedience to God’s commands and their eating from the “tree of life.” In this sense they had what is called “conditional immortality”—an 77 endless life so long as they met the conditions God specified. <br>
                           <br>
3. Man’s condition in the sin situation Rom. 5:12; 3:23 Through the fall of Adam, humankind’s representative head, the whole human family have become a sinful race. Severed from the life of God, man is subject to death. Job 4:17 All humankind, throughout both Old and New Testaments, are viewed as “mortal”— subject to death. <br>
                           <br>
4. Man’s only hope of life is in Christ Rom. 2:7 Since man does not have natural immortality, it must be sought for. 2 Tim 1:10 God has made the gift of immortality possible to be obtained through the gospel of Jesus Christ. John 3:16; Whoever will accept Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and Lord Rev. 22:17 is promised eternal life. 1 John 5: 11-13 Every believer in union with Christ has the assurance of eternal life now in this present time. John 6:40 Even though a believer may die, Jesus promises to resurrect him “at the last day.” 1 Cor. 15:20-23 Christ’s own resurrection is the believer’s assurance that Christ will awaken him to life in the resurrection at the Lord’s return. 1 Cor. 15:51-55; The redeemed (whether asleep in the graves or alive) will receive Phil. 3:20, 21 the gift of immortality at the second coming of Christ and will be given glorified bodies like His. They will never die again. Note: The common belief of “eternal torment”—and endless hell—is a man-made teaching built on the foundational idea that man possesses by nature an “immortal soul.” If a lost person has an immortal soul, it follows that God could not destroy him, but could only punish him endlessly. Such a belief is both contrary to Scripture and dishonoring to God. Since the lost sinner is mortal by nature, and since he has not accepted God’s provisions to receive eternal life, in the execution of the judgment he will perish. This will be the “second death.” (Rev. 20:14, 15; 21:8) Except that generation who will be alive at Christ’s return, all members of humankind die what may be termed “the first death.” But all—both righteous and unrighteous—will be resurrected from the “first death.” (John 5:28, 29) On the other hand, the “second death” is the ultimate end of the impenitent. “The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23) Notes:<br>

1. In the Bible death is compared to sleep John 11:11-14 Christ referred to death as a sleep. Dan. 12:2 The dead sleep in the dust of the earth. <br>
                           <br>
2. The sleep of the dead, both of the righteous and of the wicked, is in absolute unconsciousness. Eccl. 9:5 The dead know nothing. Ps. 115:17 The departed are not in heaven praising God. Job 7:9, 10 The dead do not return to their homes. Ps. 146:3, 4 The thoughts of the departed are no more. Ps. 6:5 God is not known by the dead. <br>
                           <br>
3. All who are sleeping the sleep of death will be awakened to life at the appointed time of resurrection. Job 14:14 The dead must a wait their appointed time until their change comes. Job 17:13 The place of waiting is in the grave. John 5:28, 29 All will be made alive, irrespective of character. 1 Thes. 4:16 This resurrection at the second advent is the resurrection of the just. 1 Cor. 15:42-44 Paul describes the change that will take place at the second resurrection. 1 Cor. 15:53, 54 At the resurrection of the just the righteous are immortalized. Rev. 20:6 The second death will have no power on those who are raised in the first resurrection. Rev. 20:9 There will be a resurrection of the wicked. Rev. 20:4, 5 The unrighteous will be raised at the close of the millennium. Notes:</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

He longs to show his love for Christ and for his purchased possession. He covets toil, hardship, sacrifice.” (GW 294) Notes: <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
God’s church stretches from Eden to Eden.<br>
                           <br>
Those who have obeyed God have been called by various names, such as <br>
- “the sons of God,” <br>
- “the seed of Abraham,” <br>
- “the children of Israel,” <br>
- “Christians.” <br>
They all have the same fundamental beliefs.<br>
                           <br>
a. The church of the Old Testament accepted the law of God as its rule of life. The Ten Commandment law is unchangeable because it is an expression of God’s character, which is universal, eternal, unchangeable. Long before the commandments were given to Moses on Mount Sinai the people of God were keeping them. God said, “Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws ” (Genesis 26:5).<br>
                           <br>
b. God has had only one method of salvation, one standard of righteousness, all through the ages. We read in Psalm 105:8-11 that He made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the children of Israel “for an everlasting covenant.” God declares that the covenant was made forever, “the word which He commanded to a thousand generations.” It is not correct to say that in the Old Testament times people were under law and in New Testament times people were under grace. God has always maintained a harmony of law and grace. We are saved by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and when we have experienced this salvation and have entered into a saving relationship with Him, we delight to do His will.<br>
                           <br>
c. The members of the Old Testament church showed their faith in the plan of salvation by offering a sacrifice. By faith they accepted God’s plan, for the sacrifice was a symbol of the Lamb of God, who would take away the sins of the world. They became free men and women, new creatures through faith in the coming Messiah. The hope of the ages has always been the coming of the Lord.<br>
                           <br>
d. God instructed the church members in Old Testament times through prophets. Moses was the first writer whom God used to record permanent instructions for His church and to preserve the people’s experiences for future generations. These inspired writings were read to the congregations on the seventh-day Sabbath and on other special occasions. These writings are known to us as the Old Testament.<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The church of the New Testament received its fundamental beliefs from the Old Testament<br>
church. <br>
                           <br>
It accepted the law of God as a rule of life. The Lord Jesus knew that some people would think that He came to replace the teachings of the Old Testament church and the law, so He said, “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill ” (Matthew 5:17). Like the Old Testament church, the New Testament church loved and cherished the law of God. Paul declared, “I delight in the law of God after the inward man” (Romans 7:22).<br>
                           <br>
The Church of the New Testament was privileged to have the Lord of glory come to them in<br>
human form. Unfortunately, the members of the church, even though they studied the Scriptures, were so bound by walls of tradition that they missed accepting Jesus as the Savior of the world. <br>
                           <br>
The apostles continued to preach, “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). The apostolic church was organized after the ascension of Christ, and James became the first general president. The church had a strong evangelistic program. <br>
                           <br>
In addition to the twelve, we read of Paul, perhaps the greatest evangelist of all time, and of Barnabas, Silas, John Mark, Apollos, Timothy and Titus. The deacons were also elected as officers of the early church. It seems that the headquarters of the early church was at Jerusalem, but the apostles and teachers were commissioned to go “into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” (Mark 16:15). <br>
                           <br>
Officers and members of the early Christian church wrote Gospels and Epistles, not only for the early church, but also for the Christian church in later centuries. Only a few weeks after their Lord ascended to heaven, the members of the New Testament church suffered persecution. The disciples were put in prison for preaching, and Stephen became the first martyr. As Christianity spread through the Roman Empire, the church came in contact with paganism, and the followers of Jesus were imprisoned, tortured and put to death. The darkest hours of persecution were from about A.D. 100 to 300. <br>
                           <br>
When the sword did not end the Christian church, the enemy of souls tried another method of attack. He attempted to make the church popular with the state and bring pagan rites and ceremonies into the Christian religion. Little by little false teachings filtered into the church. The simple faith was lost as Christians became wealthy and powerful in business and government. <br>
                           <br>
In 476 A.D. the barbarian tribes from the north overthrew the Roman Empire, and in the struggle that followed, the head of the church at Rome became known as the bishop. The Bible was not placed in the hands of the church members, <br>
- partly because only handwritten copies were available in those times, but <br>
- mainly because the leaders of the church were afraid to let the people study the Holy Scriptures lest they discover that some church doctrines– such as <br>
&gt; the immortality of the soul, <br>
&gt; the worship of the saints, <br>
&gt; purgatory and <br>
&gt; the observance of Sunday– <br>
were not taught by the Lord Jesus Christ. <br>
The Church of Rome states that it changed the day of worship from the seventh to the first day of the week. History and the Bible show that the observance of Sunday as a Christian institution came from paganism. Despite the compromise and apostasy that crept into the church, there was always a faithful remnant who had the faith of Jesus and kept the commandments of God. <br>

By the sixth century, the bishops of Rome held power over most of the Christian churches. This strong leadership was known as the papacy, with the pope as the head. In 538 the papal power became supreme and ruled for a period of 1260 years, as was predicted by Daniel and John in their prophetic books. This period of papal supremacy ended in 1798, when the pope of Rome was taken prisoner. By means of secular authority the church forced the followers of Jesus to choose either to accept the false doctrines and pagan ceremonies of Catholicism or to suffer imprisonment and perhaps death by the sword or by burning at the stake. This long period of history has been called the Dark Ages. As one historian stated, “The noon of the papacy was the midnight of the world.” (J. A. Wylie, quoted in GC 60). “Amid the gloom that settled upon the earth during the long period of papal supremacy, the light of truth could not be wholly extinguished. In every age there were witnesses for God– men who cherished faith in Christ as the only mediator between God and man, who held the Bible as the only rule of life, and who hallowed the true Sabbath. How much the world owes to these men, posterity will never know. They were branded as heretics, their motives impugned, their characters maligned, their writings suppressed, misrepresented or mutilated. Yet they stood firm, and from age to age maintained their faith in its purity, as a sacred heritage for the generations to come” (GC 61). <br>

“In lands beyond the jurisdiction of Rome there existed for many centuries bodies of Christians who remained almost wholly free from papal corruption... These Christians believed in the perpetuity of the law of God... Churches that held to this faith and practice existed in Central Africa and among the Armenians of Asia. “But of those who resisted the encroachments of the papal power, the Waldenses stood foremost. In the very land where popery had fixed its seat, there its falsehood and corruption were most steadfastly resisted... <br>
                           <br>
The Waldenses were among the first of the peoples of Europe to obtain a translation of the Holy Scriptures... Behind the lofty bulwarks of the mountains– in all ages the refuge of the persecuted and oppressed– the Waldenses found a hiding place. Here the light of truth was kept burning amid the darkness of the Middle Ages. Here, for a thousand years, witnesses for the truth maintained the ancient faith... <br>
                           <br>
“John Wycliffe was the herald of reform, not for England alone, but for all Christendom. The great protest against Rome which it was permitted him to utter was never to be silenced.... When Wycliffe’s attention was directed to the Scriptures, he entered upon their investigation with the same thoroughness which had enabled him to master the learning of the schools... “God had appointed to Wycliffe his work. He had put the word of truth in his mouth, and He set a guard about him that this word might come to the people. His life was protected, and his labors were prolonged, until a foundation was laid for the great work of the Reformation...Wycliffe was one the greatest of the reformers” (GC 63-66, 80, 81, 92-94). <br>
                           <br>
John Huss was one of the members of the church of the Reformation who read and believed the writings of John Wycliffe. When he became a priest he exposed unscriptural teachings of the church, and his preaching aroused the interest of the hundreds of students from all parts of Bohemia and Germany. Huss was burned at the stake, as eventually was Jerome, his companion and supporter. <br>
                           <br>
The greatest impetus to the church of the Reformation period came from the courage and faith of Martin Luther. At the age of 21, Luther was already an accomplished scholar. He read the Latin Bible, the first Bible he had ever seen, and memorized portions of Scripture. Dramatically, he came to the realization “The just shall live by faith.” On October 31, 1517, Luther nailed to the heavy wooden door of the Wittenberg Castle Church a list of ninety-five theses, or statements, of doctrine. These were later printed and sent all over Europe. When asked to retract these statements, he answered, “I cannot and I will not retract, for it is unsafe for a Christian to speak against his conscience. Here I stand, I can do no other; may God help me. Amen.” The church of the Reformation expanded due to the translation of the Bible into German<br>
by Martin Luther.<br>
                           <br>
Philip Melanchthon was a close friend of Luther and also a teacher at Wittenberg. He helped draft the Augsburg Confession, a high point of the Protestant Reformation.<br>
                           <br>
John Calvin, a Frenchman, strengthened the Huguenots. From Geneva, Switzerland, many of his students went to Spain, England and other countries, where they supported the Reformation. One of his most enthusiastic students was John Knox, whose preaching shook the foundation of apostasy in Scotland.<br>
                           <br>
Ulrich Zwingli was a reformer in Switzerland during the time of Luther. Zwingli was pastor of the Cathedral of Zurich. Switzerland became a model of peace and order as a Protestant nation and center. In Scandinavia, the Reformation prospered. <br>
                           <br>
The Petri brothers translated the Bible into Swedish, and Sweden became a Protestant country. <br>
                           <br>
John Tausen preached the Reformation in Denmark, and through his work and translation of the Bible into Danish by Pedersen, Denmark became Protestant. <br>
                           <br>
The church of the Reformation was helped by further translations of the Bible into other languages.<br>
William Tyndale and the printing press gave the common people of England the Bible in their own language, and the Bible set men in many countries free. Darkness was dispelled by the Word of God; ignorance was replaced by the Scriptures. <br>
                           <br>
Later reformers like Wesley would bring the gospel truths into even more prominence. <br>

On September 16, 1620, approximately one hundred pilgrims, men and women of iron -will religious fervor, set sail on the Mayflower for what is now known as the United States of America. Their journey of faith was undertaken because they wanted religious liberty. Their journey led the way for later freedom lovers such as Roger Williams. Williams became the founder of the colony of Rhode Island, the first settlement in America with a republican form of government and full religious freedom. <br>

The father of modern missions was William Carey of England (1761-1834). As a young man he repaired shoes, and above his workbench he had a large map of the world on the wall. The shoemaker was inspired to sail to foreign lands by the reports of Captain Cook’s voyages. A sermon he preached to a group of ministers resulted in the formation of the first missionary society, and Carey sailed as pioneer missionary to India. Despite many reverses, he translated portions of the Scriptures and laid the foundation for modern missions. As the nineteenth century dawned, the Protestant churches became mission-conscious; societies for the support of missions began to develop in many lands. No less than seven societies were established in England and America during the quarter of a century following the founding of the Church Missionary Society in 1799. The era of modern missions had begun. Among those who suffered privation and loss to extend the gospel boundaries are the following:<br>

The great apostolic doctrine of Christ’s second coming, the revival of interest in this event by the reformers and the signs that indicated its nearness formed background for the preaching of the second advent early in the nineteenth century. The work of William Miller was of first importance in this movement. Men in various lands arose preaching the second coming of the Lord Jesus. His coming to earth a second time, as King of Kings, was foretold by the prophets of the Old Testament church, and this became a recurring theme in the New Testament church. Through centuries of persecution and martyrdom, the hope of Christ’s return strengthened the Christians in the church of the Dark Ages. The reformers believed the prophecies of this event and recorded their assurance that time would not be long before Jesus returned. Now we see that His second advent becomes the dominant theme in many parts of the Christian church and is responsible for a great religious awakening. This exciting section of church history will be dealt with further in the next section of the Church Heritage course. <br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The term remnant is a Bible word to describe the church in the last period of earth’s history. Just as a remnant piece of material is the last piece of a roll of cloth, so the remnant church is the last of the church through the ages. The remnant piece of cloth is identical to the cloth at the beginning of the bolt; so the remnant church is the same true church God has had in the world all through the ages. <br>
*In the book of Revelation, John gives many characteristics of the remnant church. (Memorize these texts and their references.) <br>
• keep the commandments of God (12:17) <br>
                           <br>
• have the testimony of Jesus Christ, or the spirit of prophecy (12:17; 19:10) <br>
                           <br>
• proclaim the three angels’ messages to every nation, kindred, tongue and people (14:6-12) <br>
                           <br>
• call attention to the judgment hour of God (14:7) <br>
                           <br>
• announce that spiritual Babylon is fallen (14:8)<br>
                           <br>
• warn men and women against receiving the mark of the beast (14:9, 10) <br>
                           <br>
• have the patience of the saints (14:12) <br>
                           <br>
• have the faith of Jesus (14:12) 12 <br>
                           <br>
The remnant church is to “contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints” (Jude 3). In other words, the church is to continue the work of the Protestant Reformation. It is to put the “protest” back in protestant and lead men and women to protest against substituting tradition for Bible truth. It is to announce reforms outlined in the Word of God, so that people will walk in the light of God’s Word rather than in the teachings of man. In God’s plan He has ordained that a movement will preach the everlasting gospel and the third angel’s messages in all the world prior to the second coming of Jesus. Just as John the Baptist was the herald of the first advent of Christ, so the remnant church is to be the herald of His second advent. The Scriptures record that “there was a man sent from God, whose name was John. ” (John 1:6). <br>
                           <br>
The Bible also indicates there will be a remnant church. It, too, is sent from God. The teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church harmonize with the teachings of the Christian church through the ages. As you study the Bible, you will notice that such truths as salvation by grace through faith, the judgment, the seventh-day Sabbath, baptism by immersion, tithing, the gift of prophecy, the second advent, the unconscious state of man in death and separation from the world were all teachings of the church in other eras. The Lord Jesus Himself, who was our supreme example, was baptized by immersion, kept the Sabbath, taught the sanctity of marriage and the responsibility to pay tithe and warned men of a judgment to come. <br>
                           <br>
These are teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church today. God’s people are to be found in all religious persuasions. God’s people are those who are walking in the light of His Word as well as they understand. When the honest in heart understand the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14, they will obey these messages. John says that those who are in spiritual Babylon are to come out. God wants His people to join the remnant church so that they will be a witness to the truth and will be ready and waiting for Jesus to come. You have the privilege to be a member of the remnant church. You have a lot of light, and thus you have a God- given responsibility to live up to that light. In the next few weeks in this book you can study an outline of the history of the remnant church. As you study these pages you will sense God’s leading in the organization and activities of His remnant church. Determine today that by the grace of the Lord Jesus you will be a true representative of that church and that you can honestly sing “Faith of our fathers! living still.... We will be true to thee till death.”<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Wednesday, April 05, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
During this time period, numerous spectacular signs appeared in the natural world, which were interpreted by theologians and secular media alike as portents of grave things to come– maybe even the second coming of Christ. <br>
                           <br>
a. Lisbon Earthquake <br>
The first of these (1755) is known as the Lisbon Earthquake, due to the massive destruction caused in that city and which is still referred to by its citizenry. It was actually felt as far away as Scandinavia, Greenland and the West Indies, covering a region of more than four million square miles (6.4 million square kilometers). The earthquake was an obvious fulfillment of the prophecy connected to the opening of the sixth seal of Revelation 6:12, 13. <br>
                           <br>
b. The Dark Day<br>
Then in 1780, twenty-five years later, the second prophecy-fulfilling event took place as predicted by Jesus and recorded in Mark 13:24. The 1260-year period referred to as “those days” ended in 1798, but the persecution was to be cut short before the close of that time prophecy. This happened with the decree of Empress Maria Theresa and the Acts of Toleration from 1773 to 1776. Therefore, the sign would occur after those dates and before 1798. This happened as predicted with the Dark Day of May 19, 1780. The newspapers of the day reported clearly the most unusual circumstances of this event, which occurred over the northeastern states of America. Noah Webster, years later, wrote, “No satisfactory reason has ever been given to explain the reason for this darkness.” Those describing the darkness of the night of May 19 said, notwithstanding there was a full moon, that “if every luminous body in the universe had been struck out of existence, the darkness could not have been more complete.” <br>
                           <br>
c. The Falling of the Stars<br>
*The third sign given occurred first on November 13, 1833, in the Western Hemisphere then again a few days later on November 25th over Europe– two incredible meteorite showers, “the likes of which have never been seen in the annals of recorded history” (to quote one newspaper of the day). The first shower was witnessed from Hawaii to the mid-Atlantic and from Hudson Bay, Canada, to northern South America and was described as “streams of fire coming down from heaven” and “falling as thick as snowflakes in a snow-storm.” The second was described as “like a rain of fire...making the night so light that the people thought that the houses near them must be on fire.” “Horses were frightened by it and fell to the ground. Many people were made sick through fear.” Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of Revelation 6:13. These three spectacular signs in the natural world, placed there by God to call people’s attention to the truth, gave great impetus to the preaching of the Advent message. <br>

To symbolize the moment in the great clock of historical time for the delivery of the last warning message to a perishing world, God chose three mighty angels. God could have literally sent celestial beings in person to appear on earth in dazzling splendor and have them shout the messages from the 14 mountaintops, but this was not His plan. The members of the church of God in our time have been entrusted with the messages, and the Holy Spirit gives the power to proclaim these messages to the world. There are many doctrines contained in the three angels messages but they may be summarized as follows:<br>
                           <br>
a. The first angel <br>
The first angel’s message calls to give allegiance to God, the Creator of the heavens and earth, and warns that the judgment hour has come.<br>
                           <br>
b. The second angel <br>
The second angel’s message declares that spiritual Babylon has fallen.<br>
                           <br>
c. The third angel <br>
The third angel’s message warns men and women living in the time of the remnant church against receiving the mark of the beast. <br>
                           <br>
The books of Daniel and Revelation have special significance for the last period of the world’s history and should be studied carefully by those living in these times. The three angels messages of Revelation 14 summarize some of the special teachings of the books of Daniel and Revelation. They are to be heralded by the members of the remnant church so that those living in the last days can decide for truth and not be caught in the deceptions of tradition. <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
1. William Miller, 1782-1849 <br>
(A biography is given in the book Herald of the Midnight Cry by Paul Gordon, Pacific Press, 1990. The complete biography was written by Sylvester Bliss, 1853, Memoirs of William Miller and is still available in reprint form). During the first half of the nineteenth century, the most prominent American preacher of the second coming of Christ was William Miller. <br>
                           <br>
The eldest of a family of sixteen, Miller was able to receive what would be termed a “good education,” but his curiosity and desire for knowledge led him to study for himself. Later, due to his association in political circles with unbelievers, he became a deist, although he was not fully persuaded and still retained some hold on the Bible. Rather miraculously, he made a change from deism to full faith in God and the Bible, but he was challenged by his deist friends as to his unswerving faith in the Bible. In order to vindicate his new faith, he studied for years and during this time became convinced of the nearness of the Advent. He studied for fifteen years, from 1816 to 1831, and became more and more convinced that he should tell others of his remarkable and important discoveries. <br>
                           <br>
But now, being almost fifty years old and without any schooling in the art of public speaking, he resisted the prompting to declare what he had learned. However, he finally made a covenant with God that he would preach if an opportunity came. That Saturday morning in August of 1831, before he had made this decision with God, his nephew left home sixteen miles away in Dresden on a mission inspired by God. <br>
                           <br>
Miller was studying in his farmhouse in New York, near the border of Vermont, about a half hour after his encounter with God, when his nephew (Irving Guilford) arrived with a request from his father. The minister of the Baptist church was away, and could William come and preach tomorrow on the subject of the second coming? When he arrived back home, there was a request waiting from Poultney, Vermont. From this beginning, William Miller continued to preach, first in rural areas around his home, then in the larger towns and big cities until more than 100,000 had accepted the message of a soon coming Savior. <br>
                           <br>
His earlier messages included the signs of the second coming, specifically the one already fulfilled in 1780– the Dark Day of May 19. Soon, his work was aided by another miraculous sign, the falling of the stars on November 13, 1833. When Joshua V. Himes joined him, Boston was opened up to his ministry. Later, in 1840, he entered New York City. *Miller studied the 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8 and 9 and became convinced that the cleansing of the sanctuary was the cleansing of the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ. While he spoke much about the second coming, it was not until late in 1844 that he accepted a definite date. However, in January of 1843, he did say that Christ would come between March of 1843 and March of 1844. <br>
                           <br>
When Miller and his associates began preaching on the prophecies, many ministers saw it as an excellent means of bringing about a revival and filling their churches, but as time progressed a negative reaction set in, until by late 1843 and during 1844 many Advent believers were disfellowshipped from the churches they still loved and longed to help. Among those being asked to leave the church were Robert Harmon and his family. Opposition became stronger, and in 1844 it was generally evident that the popular churches had rejected the first angel’s message as given by the Advent preachers. When 1843 and 1844 passed and Jesus did not come, it did not shake William Miller’s faith. He continued to preach the second coming. His public ministry ended in 1845, and he died four years later. <br>
                           <br>
Throughout his life Miller was a leader in God’s work and a keen Bible student; however, he did not come to see the Sabbath truth. In ten years of ministry, William Miller gave more than three thousand lectures in nearly a thousand different places. In 1848 the veteran worker became blind. He died the following year, confident in the hope of the Saviour’s return. He received little money for his labors, but his name was inseparable from the Advent movement; he was the leader of the movement from which we descend today. Miller has rightly been called the “Morning Star” of the Advent movement because: <br>
a. He recommended the work of preaching the first angel’s message. <br>
b. He proclaimed the gospel with such vigor and fervor that the early work was known for some years as Millerism and his followers were called Millerites. <br>
                           <br>
2. Joshua V. Himes, (1805-1895) <br>
Fifty-seven-year-old Miller met 35-year-old Himes at Exeter, New Hampshire, in November of 1839. In December, Miller preached at Himes’ church in Boston, converting many, including Himes. From that point, Himes became Miller’s chief promoter, arranging preaching appointments in most of the large cities of the country. Joshua Himes was born in Rhode Island. His father wanted him to become an Episcopal minister. However, financial problems made it necessary for Joshua to become an apprentice to a cabinetmaker. His interest in church was strong, however, and at the age of 22 he entered the ministry in Boston. After his encounter with Miller, he wrote “I laid myself, family, society, reputation, all, upon that altar of God, to help him, to the extent of my power, to the end.” *Joshua V. Himes began publishing the Signs of the Times at Boston in 1840. A number of other Advent papers were published, including The Midnight Cry (1842) with a daily edition of 10,000 copies. This continued for four weeks and then became a weekly publication. Camp meetings attended by thousands did much to spread the message. Himes was a remarkable character, strong leader, courageous promoter and organizer of the Millerite movement. His contribution in producing the first periodical on the second coming of Christ was a major force in heralding the Advent in America. His career after 1850 is not striking, for he did not join the Seventh-day Adventist group after the Disappointment. However, he kept his interest in the Advent message until his death in 1895. <br>
                           <br>
3. Josiah Litch <br>
Over the course of Miller’s preaching, more than 200 ministers and 500 lecturers joined him in spreading the Advent message. One of the first of these was Josiah Litch. He had become a Christian at the age of seventeen, joined the Methodist Church and became a minister. In 1838 he read a small book written by Miller; he was uncertain about Miller’s teachings and felt that he could fault them in a few minutes. However, he confessed, “Before concluding the book I became satisfied that the arguments were so clear and that they were so scriptural that it was impossible to disprove the position which Mr. Miller had endeavored to establish.” <br>
                           <br>
4. Charles Fitch <br>
Charles Fitch was pastoring a Congregational church in Boston when he studied Miller’s printed lectures and began preaching the Advent message. Fitch contributed to the movement in four ways: <br>
a. Preacher– His central theme was “Prepare to meet thy God.” Of all the preachers in the movement, it was said of him, “perhaps none was so widely loved.” <br>
b. Writer– He published a widely circulated paper titled Second Advent of Christ. <br>
c. Hymn writer– He wrote several hymns, one of which is still found in our old Church Hymnal listed as number 338: One Precious Boon, O Lord, I Seek,(sung to the tune of Uxbridge by Lowel Mason). <br>
d. Artist– Perhaps he is most remembered today because of his artistic ability in developing the first prophetic charts (1842) introducing the concept of audiovisuals in public evangelism. As the weather turned cold in October of 1844, Fitch had just baptized a group of people in the cold waters of the north country when several more stepped forward requesting baptism. After these, yet another group decided to join and requested baptism. The chill he received turned to pneumonia, and on October 14, just eight days prior to the date he preached about so fervently, he died. <br>
                           <br>
5. Among Many Others <br>
Sylvester Bliss wrote the memoirs of William Miller in 1853. S. S. Snow determined that the date for the close of the 2300-day prophesy was in the fall of 1844 and not in the spring, as first thought. James White, at the age of 21, rode horseback for his evangelistic campaign one winter and reported back to the leaders more than a thousand converts in three months of preaching. <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The Advent movement began at the same time in both Europe and America as men of God were led to study the prophecies of the Bible. It was providential that Christians in various lands studied the Scriptures and arrived at that belief that Jesus was coming soon. We list here only a few of the more prominent ones: <br>
                           <br>
1. Joseph Wolff From 1821 to 1845 <br>
Joseph Wolff traveled in Africa, Syria, Persia, India, the United States– even to the island of St. Helena. He preached to rulers and paupers alike. One of the world’s most noted missionary travelers and language students, Joseph Wolff became known as the “missionary to the world. ” Born in Bavaria, Joseph was the son of a Jewish rabbi. At eleven years of age, he left home seeking an education so that he might become a missionary. He was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church but very soon challenged the authority of the church on doctrine and dogma. Wolff spoke fourteen languages, which allowed him great ease with dignitaries and common folk alike. His travels in Asia and Africa involved many dangers and narrow escapes. He was beaten, starved and sold into slavery. Three times he received the death penalty. Through it all, he carried his Bible and warned people of the coming reign of the Messiah. <br>
                           <br>
2. Johann A. Bengel <br>
Before Wolff or Miller, during the first two decades of the 1700's the second coming was taught in Germany by Bengel, a Lutheran minister. He believed in religious liberty and trained young men for the ministry. However, his greatest influence was felt through his books about the Second Advent; Wesley drew heavily from his writings, and they were spread even into Russia. “Probably no other continental theologian did so much as he to call attention to the importance of the prophetic portions 18 of the Word...especially as it relates to the second coming of Christ.” <br>
                           <br>
3. Edward Irving <br>
Next to North America, the proclamation of the Second Advent had its fullest development in Great Britain. As a Scottish evangelist, Edward Irving, who received his M.A. at the age of seventeen, began studying the prophesies, and particularly those with reference to the second coming. His stature (6ft. 4in/ 1 mt. 95 cm.) and his eloquence attracted the upper classes, including the Prime Minister. The churches were so full that tickets needed to be purchased six weeks in advance. A clergyman from Paris heard him preach and lent him a copy of Lacunza’s book, The Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty. Irving learned Spanish to be able to read it, then translated it into English. He was also a key participant in the Albury Conferences organized by Henry Drummond.<br>
                           <br>
4. Henry Drummond <br>
Henry, an English banker and member of Parliament, devoted his life to Christian service. He arranged a series of five annual prophetic conferences. Some twenty ministers from various church and orthodox communions and countries were present, among them Joseph Wolff. At these conferences the prophecies of the books of Daniel and Revelation were studied. Of these, Irving wrote, “We were so overruled by the one Spirit of truth and love, as to have found our way to harmony and coincidence in the main points of all these questions.” <br>
                           <br>
5. Robert Winter <br>
Mr. Winter heard the doctrine of the Second Advent while attending a camp meeting during a visit to America. In 1842 he returned to England, where he entered into the work of preaching the Advent. In his frequent letters to America he told of his progress. In one letter he said, “I preach about the streets with my chart hoisted up on a pole. Our books are flying about and are making quite a stir in this great city.” God blessed his humble efforts with the baptism of several thousand converts. <br>
                           <br>
6. Manuel de Lacunza <br>
Under the pseudonym of Juan Ben-Ezra, Lacunza, a Jesuit priest, called attention to the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. Born in Chile, he later lived in exile in Spain and Italy. He was dissatisfied with the Catholic interpretations of prophecy and went to the Bible to find out for himself. His study resulted in the writing of the book The Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty. Despite laborious hand-copying, it was widely circulated and was translated from Spanish into Latin, Italian, and English (this one by Irving). <br>
                           <br>
7. H. Heintzpeter <br>
The keeper of the Royal Museum in Holland, Heintzpeter was given a vision of Christ’s soon return. He spoke of it using Bible texts to prove his point, then wrote several pamphlets from about 1830- 19 1842, in which he explained the light he had received. He first heard of William Miller twelve years after he began to publish. <br>
                           <br>
8. Louis Gaussen <br>
The book The Great Controversy nicely sums up the work of Gaussen on pages 364-366. Ellen White tells of his unique style of preaching the good news through a method first used by the reformer William Farel teaching the children. No one could use the excuse that these things were too hard and complicated to understand if children grasped the significance and enjoyed it. The plan worked; adults began to come and listen, high society was reached and foreigners visiting Geneva heard and were convicted, carrying the news to other countries. Eventually he had the lessons published, which only widened the success. Eventually a reaction set in. Even though he was one of the most distinguished and beloved preachers in the French language, he was suspended for the principal offense of using the Bible for instructing the youth instead of the church catechism. Of course, this only meant that he continued his ministry apart from the recognized church. <br>
                           <br>
9. Francisco Ramos Mejia <br>
It is worth taking note of the impact the second coming concept had in other, perhaps lesser known, surroundings. One such example is Argentina. Among the leaders of this country’s struggle for independence were several national heros who were also students and believers in the Advent. Ramos Mejia (who died before Miller began his preaching) had determined that Christ’s return was eminent; the Bible and not tradition was the rule of faith; education was of paramount importance (began schools for the Indians); the Ten Commandments were the norm for Christians (he kept the Sabbath); and he established the correct understanding of the relationship between faith and works. Others included Manuel Belgrano, the designer of the national flag, Domingo Sarmiento, first president of Argentina, and many others.<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
“And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because shemade all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication” (Rev. 14:8).20The message of the second angel, which is joined with that of the first angel, may at first glanceseem unrelated to it. However, in this section we shall see how the two messages were joinedtogether. The first and second angels’ messages were given at the right time, when the hearts of thepeople would accept them. The work that God planned to accomplish through these two messageswas effectively done. The second angel’s message was proclaimed mainly during the “tarryingtime” between March and October, 1844.Wiliam Miller began his public ministry in 1831, and many voices were heard in other parts of theworld announcing the coming of Christ. However, the focal point of Advent teaching was in NewEngland, the northeastern corner of the United States. William Miller worked almost singlehandedly for several years. In 1839 and 1840 men of influence and ability as writers and preachersbegan to accept the teaching and to join Miller in his devoted evangelism.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">From 1840 to 1842 a series of general conferences of Advent believers was held in various cities ofNew England. William Miller had been unable to attend the previous meetings, but one, in his hometown, enabled him to meet with the earnest, scholarly and skillful men who had joined themovement, some through his teachings and some through independent study.About 200 leaders were associated at these conferences, which unified their thinking and stimulatedtheir preaching. Many of them were ministers of Protestant churches, and they represented most ofthe popular denominations. They preached the first angel’s message in their own pulpits, in otherchurches, in various public meetings and at camp meetings. There were many Advent paperspublished, but the nearest to an official organ of the group was the </span><span style="color:#000000;">Signs of the Times. </span><span style="color:#000000;">They formedthe Adventist Association without shifting their loyalty from their own congregations ordenominations.The common doctrines discussed at the conferences and then taught to the people are as follows:· the nature of Christ’s coming in the clouds of heaven· the signs of His coming, as seen in the Dark Day, the meteoric shower and conditions ofunrest·the prophecies in the Revelation, ending with the three woes and their confirmation,observed in the loss of independence of the Ottoman Empire in 1840·the 1260 years of papal domination, ending with the captivity of the pope in 1798·other related time prophecies·the 2300 years of Daniel 8:1421·the “premillennial” interpretation of the coming of Christ in “about 1843&quot;In spite of occasional opposition, particularly to the preaching of the premillennial return of Christ,the Millerites preached and prospered, maintaining friendly relations with the variousdenominations. Many infidels were converted and the sale of Bibles rose sharply.Charles Fitch, in the summer of 1843, printed a sermon that he had recently preached, applyingRevelation 14:8 and 18:2-4 to the Protestant churches as well as to Roman Catholicism. He said thatboth branches of Christendom had become Babylon and had fallen by rejecting the messages ofChrist’s second coming. There was good reason for this interpretation, for by this time manychurches had barred Advent preaching and preachers.In this same summer ministers were ordained by the Millerite group to preach the Second Advent,and in the </span><span style="color:#000000;">Signs of the Times </span><span style="color:#000000;">believers were advised to separate from their congregations. Memberswere being asked by their church officers to change their beliefs in premellennialism or withdrawfrom membership. An example of this is the story of the Harmon family. Ellen White recounts theexperience of her family in the book </span><span style="color:#000000;">Life Sketches, </span><span style="color:#000000;">pages 50-53. The concluding paragraph of thatstory reads, “The next Sunday, at the commencement of the love feast, the presiding elder read offour names, seven in number, as discontinued from the church.”When some of the Advent preachers applied the term “Babylon” directly to the churches thatrejected the doctrine of the judgment and the return of Jesus, the message of the second angel wasjoined to that of the first. A paper entitled “</span><span style="color:#000000;">Babylon the Great Is Fallen</span><span style="color:#000000;">” was published in Oswego,New York. By the summer of 1844, at least 50,000 believers had separated from the churches toform groups of their own.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">William Miller and others attempted to find a definite time for the end of the 2300-day prophecy. Atfirst they declared that it was “about 1843.&quot; Later, the limit of time was set at March 21 and thenApril 18, 1844, the end of the Jewish year 1843. The time passed without any unusual happening.This first disappointment was a heavy blow to the believers and was followed by a period ofquietness, the “tarrying time” of the parable of the ten virgins, as the experience was laterinterpreted. After this disappointment the scholars returned to their books and discovered theirerror– 2300 years would include the complete years of 457 B.C. and A.D. 1843. Thus, a happeningwithin the year 457 B.C. would be matched in the prophecy at the same date in 1844. This had beenpointed out a year before but had not been generally heeded. In the summer of 1844 a new burst oflight appeared and illuminated the Advent movement to its dramatic climax in October.At a camp meeting in New Hampshire in August, Joseph Bates felt that he would receive new light.He invited Samuel S. Snow to give his study on “The Midnight Cry.” The man not only spoke thatday but each day afterward until the meetings closed. The people were thrilled, for the parable ofthe ten virgins seemed to apply to them. Brother Snow explained that the Advent people had22expected the Lord to come in the spring of that year but had been forced to wait. The 2300-dayprophecy could not end until the fall of 1844. A closer study of the sanctuary and its servicesrevealed that the cleansing of the sanctuary occurred on the tenth day of the seventh month. Thiscoincided with the idea that the 2300 days would end in the fall, for the tenth day of the seventhmonth (of the Jewish year) in 1844 was on October 22.In the parable of the ten virgins the cry was made at midnight. Samuel Snow’s midsummer messageseemed to correspond to the “midnight cry.” The reality of the truth gripped the hearts of the people,and they went from the camp meeting to herald the glad tidings far and wide, “Behold, thebridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. ” The “Midnight cry” was given during the “tarryingtime.” The 50,000 Advent believers were so impressed that the Lord would come that many of themdid not cultivate their fields, because they thought He would have come before another harvest time.They spent their time proclaiming the coming of Jesus.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">As October 22, 1844, drew near, tension increased among the Adventists. There were thousandswho were completely unconcerned or who were watching merely as bystanders. Newspapers hadpublished sensational stories about the Millerites. However, the sober factual reports described theAdventist groups as sincere, devout people who were calm and earnest. There were several classesof people among the Advent believers. Some had joined the group through fear; some rejected theexact date, such as William Miller himself until a few weeks before October 22. Then there were thehonest believers, the majority of whom accepted the day; they made consistent preparation to meetJesus.The day arrived. The Adventists were in meeting houses or private homes. The believers sanghymns and reviewed evidences that the Lord would come. The day passed and the sun set. Stillthere was hope: “For ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, orat the cock-crowing, or in the morning” (Mark 13:35). Finally, midnight passed. Prayer wasoffered, and tears filled the eyes of some of the believers. The believers were grief-stricken andasked one another, “Have the Scriptures failed?” Further diligent study would reveal that the timeprophecy was correct, but the event to take place had been incorrectly interpreted.Hiram Edson said, “There is a God in heaven. He has made Himself known to us in blessing, inforgiving, in redeeming, and He will not fail us now. Sometime soon this mystery will be solved.”Many Millerites drifted away soon after the disappointment, though a substantial group held togetherfor several years. Miller died in December, 1849. Some of his associates continued to set new datesfor several years. They became the Evangelical Adventists, believing in consciousness in death andan eternally burning hell. They gradually declined into extinction. Another group, which believedin the unconscious state of the dead but continued to observe Sunday, took the name AdventChristians. Their church still exists. There were several other groups with different ideas, and somewent into fanaticism. We are primarily interested in the group including Hiram Edson, Joseph23Bates, James White and Ellen Harmon, who formed the nucleus of the remnant church. (James andEllen were united in marriage August 30, 1846).Those who were to form this nucleus shared the bitterness and heartache of the disappointment withthe other believers. Most of those gathered at Edson’s farmhouse went sorrowfully home on themorning of October 23. Edson and some close friends went to the barn for a season of prayer, whichgave them confidence that the Lord would show them the way.After breakfast Edson said to one of the believers who remained, “Let us go out to comfort thebrethren with this assurance.” The two men walked through the field where Edson’s corn was stillin the shocks. They went with meditative hearts, thinking of the disappointment. At about themiddle of the field, Edson stopped. * He seemed to see the sanctuary in heaven and Christ as HighPriest going from the Holy Place of the sanctuary into the Most Holy. “I saw distinctly and clearly,”writes Edson, “that instead of our High Priest coming out of the Most Holy of the heavenlysanctuary to come to this earth on the tenth day of the seventh month, at the end of the 2300 days,He for the first time entered on that day the second apartment of that sanctuary and that He had awork to perform in the Most Holy before coming to this earth.” This cleansing of the sanctuarymarked the beginning of the investigative judgment.His companion had gone across the field; but at the fence, he turned. Seeing Edson far behind, hecalled, “Brother Edson, what are you stopping for?” Edson called, “The Lord was answering ourmorning prayer.” Catching up with his friend, he told him of his new insight.The cornfield experience led these men and others to intensively study the sanctuary service given toIsrael and the significance of the doctrine of the 2300 days. They published their findings in Adventjournals, and Hiram Edson called a conference late in 1845.Now the mystery was resolved and the dates confirmed. The message of the first angel continued aspresent truth. It was and is a powerful doctrine to turn sinners to Christ in this time of judgment.The second angel’s message held significance for the period preceding the disappointment and holdsadditional significance for the future.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">The study of the sanctuary was the key that unlocked the mystery of the disappointment. It was alsoa key to the central doctrine of the </span><span style="color:#000000;">*Third Angel’s Message</span><span style="color:#000000;">, which points especially to the law ofGod and particularly to the consequences of transgressions. There is a definite link between thismessage and the Sabbath, which is the center of the law. It was in the light given to the earlybelievers on the Sabbath truth that God was preparing for the final message.During the time of the Midnight Cry in 1844, Mrs. Rachel Oakes (later Preston), a Seventh DayBaptist, came to Washington, New Hampshire, to visit her daughter, who was one of the Adventbelievers. Mrs. Oakes was an ardent believer in the Bible Sabbath and had brought with her asupply of tracts. Soon she accepted the Advent doctrines, and she also continued to keep the24Sabbath. The tracts she quietly distributed bore fruit. At a Sunday morning service one of theAdventist believers arose and said he was convinced the seventh day was the true Bible Sabbath, andthat he, for one, was resolved to keep it. Several others expressed themselves as like-minded, andwithin a few days practically the entire company of forty became Sabbathkeepers.Thus began, in a sense, at Washington, New Hampshire, the first Seventh-day Adventist church,although it was years before the Seventh-day Adventist organization was established.The first Adventist minister to accept the Sabbath was Frederick Wheeler, of the Washington group.He was formerly a Methodist minister and an associate of William Miller.Adventists as a body were called to the Sabbath question through an essay on the subject by T. M.Preble, published in a paper at Portland, Maine early in 1845. J. B. Cook also wrote an article thatappeared in print shortly after Mr. Preble’s, in which he showed conclusively that there is noScriptural evidence for keeping Sunday as the seventh-day Sabbath. A Sabbath movement hadbegun that could not easily be stopped.Hearing of the Washington, New Hampshire, company that was keeping the Sabbath, Joseph Batesdecided to visit them to see what it all meant. He went to New Hampshire, studied the subject, sawtheir views were correct and accepted the light. Returning home, he met on the bridge between NewBedford and Fairhaven a Mr. Hall, who greeted him, “Captain Bates, what’s the news?” “Thenews,” replied the captain, “is that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord our God.” “Well,”said Mr. Hall, “I shall go home and read my Bible and see about that.” He did so, and when nextthey met, Mr. Hall had accepted the Sabbath truth and was obeying it </span><span style="color:#000000;">(</span><span style="color:#000000;">The Great Advent Movement</span><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><span style="color:#000000;">pp.<br>
39, 40).</span><span style="color:#000000;">Although the seventh-day Sabbath truth was highlighted again in 1844, there have beenSabbathkeepers since the commencement of time. Even during the Dark Ages, groups observed theseventh-day Sabbath. The Seventh Day Baptists loyally preserved the truth of the fourthcommandment for centuries, and we have seen it is from them that the Adventists first learned of theSabbath truth.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">The doctrine of the seventh-day Sabbath soon became a test for those wishing to join theSabbathkeeping Adventists. The reading of a single article was sufficient to convince Joseph Bates.Hiram Edson also readily accepted the Sabbath truth. Frederick Wheeler and William Farnsworthneeded only the introduction to the subject and a little time to study; soon they were Sabbathkeepers.James and Ellen White were not impressed with the importance of the Sabbath doctrine at first.After their marriage the Whites studied a pamphlet that Bates had published, and they soon acceptedthe Sabbath.However, these were difficult days for these leaders, for there was not yet a unity of teaching. In theprovidence of God several conferences were held about this time. The believers dug deeply into the25Scriptures and compared text with text until they knew the doctrines of the Bible. In all, there weresix Bible conferences during 1848. Ellen White played a very important part in these conferences.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">“While in vision on Patmos, the apostle John saw symbols of great eras of world history. As Johnpeered into the future, he caught a glimpse of God’s loyal people near the close of time, and he sawthe intensity of the conflict. As the prophet looked closely, he observed that this church was keepingGod’s commandments. He saw, too, that it had special divine guidance through the Spirit ofProphecy, ‘for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy’ ” </span><span style="color:#000000;">(</span><span style="color:#000000;">Revelation 19:10</span><span style="color:#000000;">)</span><span style="color:#000000;">, The Story of Our<br>
Church</span><span style="color:#000000;">, p. 186.</span><span style="color:#000000;">From the very beginning, God has in various ways kept in contact with His church. His leadership isnot always as obvious as the pillar of cloud by day or pillar of fire by night, but His people are madeaware of His presence. The main channel of communication between God and His people hasalways been through “His servants the prophets.” As predicted in Revelation 12:17 and 19:10, theremnant church was to have the gift of prophecy.William Ellis Foy was born in 1818 to Joseph and Elizabeth Foy in Augusta, Maine a free state soconsequently, William was born “free” and grew up during a time of racial conflict and divide. Hisbirthplace, however, was far removed from the oppressive conditions of the slaveholding states, asMaine had very few Blacks and virtually no slaves, but was not without racial prejudice.After growing up in a country setting for a large part of his life, he then married in the middle or late1830s and moved to Boston, where his skills in farming and carpentry provided him a means bywhich to live.In 1835 Foy was converted, under the preaching of Elder Silas Curtis at the Freewill Baptist Churchin Augusta, Maine. Here Foy converted to Christianity and began to inquire what he should do to besaved. Shortly thereafter, Foy began receiving visions about the Advent. After he moved to Boston,many witnessed him during times of these visions.His first vision was concerning the ultimate victory of the saints. Then late one Friday evening heentered into his second vision, which lasted 12½ hours, until early Saturday morning. It was basedupon the judgment and the level of preparedness of those in the church. Given the racial tensions ofthe times, Foy was apprehensive to share the visions. However, he trusted God and shared what hehad been given.After traveling extensively with his message, Foy was given two more visions shortly before thedisappointment. New material was presented to him showing three platforms, which indicated athird phase in the message from God for that time. In perplexity he ceased public work butmaintained an interest in the Advent movement. He died on November 9, 1893, at the age of 75.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">(</span><span style="color:#000000;">Excerpts taken from </span><span style="color:#000000;">The Unknown Prophet </span><span style="color:#000000;">by Delbert W. Baker)26Hazen Foss, a talented young Adventist of Poland, Maine, was given a vision a few weeks before thegreat disappointment. The vision included the three platforms shown to Foy. Foss was warned ofsome of the difficulties he would have to face as a messenger of the Lord and when he related thevision. Due to the ridicule of the people, he refused to do so. The vision was repeated, with awarning that if he still refused, the gift would be withdrawn. Since he still refused, a third visionwas given telling him the gift was being given to one of the weakest of the weak. Though he liveduntil 1893, he never regained an interest in personal religion.Ellen Harmon was the third person selected by the Lord to be the messenger to the remnant. InDecember, 1844, two months after the disappointment, when a voice of assurance from heaven wasneeded for the Advent believers, God gave a vision to Ellen, a young woman of seventeen. In brief,a symbolic representation of the future of the church was portrayed to her. The time covered wasfrom October 22 until the saints would enter the New Jerusalem. She saw that the coming of Jesuswas not as near as they had hoped. The glory of the vision of heaven was so real to Ellen that aftershe came out of vision everything seemed dark about her. She wept as she realized that herexperience was only a vision. She was homesick for heaven.About a week after Ellen’s first vision she was given a second revelation. She was told she must gofrom place to place and relate the divine messages that had been revealed to her. At the same timeshe was shown the trials she would face.In her first vision Ellen Harmon saw the same portrayal that was revealed to Foss and Foy. Thevision depicted the journeys of the people of God on their way to the kingdom.In the early Advent church each member had to decide whether or not to believe that EllenHarmon’s messages were from God. In like manner a person who joins the Seventh-day AdventistChurch today must determine in their own mind whether she spoke truthfully or not when shedeclared that God called her to be His messenger. However, we are not left in doubt, because theBible gives important tests by which we may check the claims of the writings of Ellen White as oneof His prophets. *There are four clear tests, and we see that in each case her life and work harmonizewith these Bible tests.1. “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is becausethere is no light in them” (Isaiah 8:20).There is no conflict between the statements in the </span><span style="color:#000000;">Testimonies for the Church </span><span style="color:#000000;">and theteachings of the Bible. Ellen White consistently upholds and magnifies the Bible.2. “By their fruits ye shall know them” (Matthew 7:20).The Sabbath School, Christian education, healthful living, the publishing work are but a fewof the fruits that have come to the church or a result of following counsels of the messengerof the Lord . Over a period of seventy years, Ellen White proved to be a genuine Christian,and a wise and safe leader. She devoted her life to the work of God, never seeking office or27wealth.3. “When the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known”(Jeremiah 28:9).There are many Bible prophets, and there are people in the Scriptures who are named to beprophets but did not make predictions. However, if a prophet makes predictions, they needto come to pass. In 1848 Ellen White predicted that the publishing work, which would beginwith a few papers in a carpetbag, would grow until it would seem “like streams of light thatwent clear round the world.” Today, the Seventh-day Adventist Church operates about fiftypublishing houses. There are many other predictions, such as stating that cancer was a virusand that the world would become involved in international war, with the loss of ships andnavies and millions of lives, which confirm her words to be true. One of the mostoutstanding recent fulfillments can be read about in the first few pages of </span><span style="color:#000000;">Testimonies</span><span style="color:#000000;">volume 9, regarding New York City.4. “Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God” (1John 4:2).Books such as </span><span style="color:#000000;">The Desire of Ages</span><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><span style="color:#000000;">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing</span><span style="color:#000000;">, and<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">Christ’s Object Lessons </span><span style="color:#000000;">are clear witnesses to the fact that Ellen White confessed thatJesus was God.Through the years enemies have bitterly assailed Mrs. White and her claims to divinerevelations. Their work has been built largely on prejudice, distortion of facts and outrightfalsehood. Such attacks were to be expected. However, more than sixty volumes andthousands of magazine articles still bear testimony to the divine commission of thisremarkable lady. The history of the church is interwoven with the story of guidance by thegift of prophecy. Wherever the church has followed the counsels from the Lord it has, aspromised, prospered.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">1. Ellen Gould Harmon was born November 26, 1827, on a farm at Gorham, Maine, about twelvemiles west of Portland. With her twin sister she was the youngest of a family of eight. She was anormal, happy child with a pleasant disposition and a deep sense of the importance of religion,which she received from her devout parents.<br>
                           <br>
2. A turning point in her life came when one day as she was crossing a park she received a blow onher face by a stone thrown by another girl. Her nose was broken and her face temporarilydisfigured. She was unconscious for three weeks, and the shock rendered her an invalid for someconsiderable time. Study was out of the question, and although she endeavored to attend schoolagain, she finally had to surrender any plans for academic education due to her health.<br>
                           <br>
3. In 1840 and again in 1842 Ellen Harmon, with her family, listened to William Miller’s doctrineof the imminent advent of Christ. They accepted his teachings while remaining Methodists.28However, it was not easy. During this period Ellen went through a spiritual crisis in making herdecision. At a camp meeting in the latter part of 1840 she gave her heart to God, and immediatelyher troubled spirit was calmed. From that time forward she began a new relationship with the Lord.<br>
                           <br>
4. Her family was among those who accepted the “midnight cry” to forsake and leave the apostatechurches. They were among the company that experienced the “Great Disappointment” butremained firm in the Advent message.<br>
                           <br>
5. Her first vision occurred shortly after the great disappointment, and she was shown the progressof God’s people toward the heavenly home. As she thought of her youth (she was just seventeen),her timidity, her poor health and the hardships before her, she prayed earnestly that God wouldrelease her from the responsibility to be His messenger. However, the call of duty did not change,and she expressed her willingness to go and do what God wanted her to do.<br>
                           <br>
6. In April, 1847, she was given a vision of the Sabbath. She saw the temple in heaven with Jesusraising the cover of the lid. There she saw the Ten Commandments with a soft halo of light aroundthe fourth and heard an angel confirming its importance. She was shown that if the Sabbath hadalways been kept, there would not have been an infidel or atheist, and the world would have beenprevented from idolatry. This vision opened up to her the relationship of the Sabbath to the thirdangel’s message. The believers who saw the true importance of the sanctuary, Sabbath and SecondAdvent doctrines were the forerunners of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (</span><span style="color:#000000;">Life Sketches</span><span style="color:#000000;">, pp. 95,96).<br>

7. For the next seventy years her work was to receive counsels from God and to give them to hispeople. She spoke to many audiences, wrote about forty volumes of books (which became known asthe “Spirit of Prophecy”) and contributed many articles in Seventh-day Adventist publications.Perhaps her best-known and best-loved book is the story of Christ’s life, </span><span style="color:#000000;">The Desire of Ages. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Shetraveled widely, not only in North America but to many parts of Europe and out to Australia andNew Zealand, where her counsel was used in laying the basis of the work there. She wasinstrumental in setting up Avondale College in Australia.<br>

8. The messages that Ellen White received from God were usually given to her in vision form.During these visions it was evident that she was under divine control. She looked intensely at somedistant object; her breathing ceased but her face did not lose natural color, nor did her pulse fail.Various testimonials from eyewitnesses, including doctors, have all attested that the wholeprocedure was not of this world. F.C. Castle, who witnessed a medical examination, says, “Alighted candle was held close to her eyes, which were wide open, and not a muscle of the eye moved.She was then examined with regard to her pulse and her breathing, and there was no respiration.The result was that all were satisfied they would not be accountable for unnatural scientificprinciples.” This frail woman gave evidence of great strength while in vision; at one time she held alarge eighteen-pound Bible in her extended left hand for half an hour.<br>

                           <strong>James White (1821-1881)</strong><br>
He was a pioneer minister in the Advent movement. In spite of physicaldefects, he felt that God wanted him to warn the world of its nearing end and went on a preachingtour carrying the first angel’s message to many towns. He was a persuasive speaker and a goodsinger, but above all he was a leader of men. “James White, intrepid, resourceful, far-seeing, eagerleader of the infant Seventh-day Adventist Church, who in the early decades of its history had achief part: first, in framing the doctrines and bringing out a people to stand upon them; second, inpromoting and organizing the ecclesiastical polity; and third, in founding and managing theinstitutions– corporate church, publishing, health and educational– which make up the pillars ofthis cause. He was a born leader...All his co-workers felt the dynamic power of his spirit”(Spalding).<br>
                           <br>
*James White served as president of the General Conference for three terms, totaling ten years.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Joseph Bates (1792-1872)<br>
                           </strong>He had risen from cabin boy to captain and had retired from the sea beforethe first angel’s message came to him. God had been leading him; always a man of good principlesand a lover of right and truth, he had given up the use of alcohol and tobacco while sailing the seas.He was a member of the Christian Church and about fifty years of age when he was called to preach;he organized one of the first temperance societies in America. He poured his money into the workuntil, at the time of the great disappointment, he had little left; after that, he lived much by faith.He was the first of leaders who later became Seventh-day Adventist ministers to accept the Sabbathtruth and introduce it to other leading workers and believers. He also wrote the first comprehensiveSabbath tract that was printed. He spent much of his time from then on traveling the “unworked30West,” even in the winter snows of Canada and in all parts of eastern America. “He shrank from nohardship in his untiring zeal.” He was older in years than his more youthful associates, the Whites,and they leaned upon his fatherly advice in the pioneering days of the movement. He was activeuntil the end of his life; he died in 1872 and is buried near his home in Michigan.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>John Nevins Andrews (1829-1883) </strong><br>
He was but fifteen years old when he shared in the greatdisappointment. He began to preach at 21. He was among the first of the leaders to accept theSabbath truth, was a diligent student, an able writer (History of the Sabbath) and a good organizer.He led out in studying God’s plan for gospel finance, from which was developed the tithing systemas we know it today. In August, 1860, he suggested publicly that the bretheren should meet todiscuss church organization; as a result, the Advent Review Publishing Association was formed, andthe name “Seventh-day Adventist” was chosen for the church. Partly because he was a goodlinguist, he was sent to Europe in 1874 as our first official overseas missionary, and he laid a firmfoundation for the work there. *J. N. Andrews was the third president of the General Conference.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>John Norton Loughnborough (1832-1924) </strong><br>
He preached for the Adventists from the age of sixteen,though he had not heard the Sabbath truth until 1852, when J. N. Andrews explained it so clearlythat he accepted it immediately. He worked with M. E. Cornell in the 1850's before ministersreceived salaries, laboring at any work he could find for four half-days a week, and preaching therest of the time.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>John Byington (1798-1887)</strong><br>
He is best remembered as the first president of the General Conference.He had been a Methodist minister before the three angels’ messages came to him. One of the firstSabbath schools and the first Adventist elementary school (begun in 1853) were taught inByington’s home at Buck’s Bridge, New York. The teacher was his daughter Martha. EarlySabbathkeepers gathered at his property, on which he built an Adventist church.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>J. H. Waggoner (1820-1889) </strong><br>
He accepted the Advent message in 1852 and is listed among those whocalled for a discussion of church organization in 1860; by then he was one of the leaders amongSabbathkeeping Adventists. He worked in the West, chiefly as the editor of the Signs of the Times.Later he served in Europe and died in Switzerland.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Uriah (1832-1903) and Annie (1828-1855) Smith </strong><br>
These were two promising young people, brother andsister, who were teaching when the Lord called them to work for Him. Annie Smith responded as aresult of a dream about Elder Joseph Bates, whom she heard speak very soon after. She was anardent worker, best remembered for her poems, many of which were used as hymns. Her life endedprematurely in 1855 as a result of tuberculosis. Uriah Smith accepted the message about the end of1852, more than a year after his sister, and entered the publishing work. He was an ordainedminister of the gospel and spent most of his life as an editor, from 1853 to 1903, the year of hisdeath. He was an editor of the Review and Herald and author. Thoughts on Daniel and the<br>
Revelation is the work by which he is best remembered. In 1888 he was a leader in the discussionson righteousness by faith, and he was one of the prominent Bible scholars of the denomination.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Frederick Wheeler (1811-1910) </strong><br>
He was a Methodist-Adventist preacher who lived in New Hampshire31and pastored the church at Washington. He was essentially the first Seventh-day Adventist minister,for he accepted the Sabbath truth brought to him by Mrs. Rachel Oakes in 1844. Among those in hiscongregation who accepted the third angel’s message were the Farnsworth brothers, William andCyrus.<br>

                           </strong><br>
1853-1863 The Seventh-day Adventist Church did not come out of the 1844 movement with a structure and corporate identity. The scattered believers took nearly twenty years to develop the components that would finally bring about the need for a structured approach to fulfilling its mission. A few of these components, or steps, we list as we follow the move toward organization. <br>

*An initial step toward church organization was the need to identify those persons who, as itinerant preachers, would travel around the country preaching to small, scattered groups of believers who often were quite cut off from current happenings. It was decided that identification cards would be issued and signed by the “leading brethren,” thus certifying the validity of the doctrines presented by the carrier. This procedure was introduced in 1853 (the forerunner of credentials). While the preachers received no salary and were thus self-supporting, they traveled and preached with zeal. <br>

During the summer of 1853, Elders J. N. Loughborough and M. E. Cornell were sent out at the expense of the Battle Creek church to travel in three adjacent states. They became the first to have a “travel budget.” The following summer they raised the necessary $200 to purchase a 600-foot circular tent and on June 10, 1854, held the first-ever tent meeting among Seventh-day Adventists. While both these events may appear to us quite insignificant, to a motley group of a few hundred scattered believers these were both momentous risky decisions with little support except faith. The year 1853 also saw the development of embryonic structure with the formation of regular Sabbath schools in Rochester and Buck’s Bridge, New York. The idea had been introduced the year before with a novel series of Sabbath school lessons printed in the new magazine The Youth’s Instructor. <br>

The Whites had settled in Rochester, New York, where they had enough room to set up a small print shop to produce the magazines and pamphlets that were rapidly expanding the work of the gospel. However, the primary growth of the movement was following the westward expansion of the nation, and Rochester was getting left behind and out of the way. The print shop was incorporated instead of being under private ownership. Then four laymen offered James White $1,200 as an interest-free loan to set up the press in Battle Creek. The offer was accepted, and in 1855 the press moved to a two-story 20 x 30-foot (6mt. x 9mt.) house in Michigan. Here the fledgling church established its headquarters, until 1903, when it moved to Washington, D.C.( See Life Sketches of Ellen White, pp. 33 388-393, for interesting further details regarding this latter move.) In the new location the press was kept busy printing the Review and Herald, the Youth Instructor, temperance and evangelistic tracts, and an increasing load of all sorts. Uriah Smith, who had joined the movement two years earlier, was appointed editor, and writers included Andrews, White, Waggoner, Cottrell, and Pierce. The first issue (volume 7, number 10) of the Review in its new home was dated December 4, 1855. <br>

In 1849 a group of Sabbathkeeping Adventists had begun to publish a paper called The Present<br>
Truth. In 1850 they also had published six issues of The Advent Review. In November of that year, these two papers had merged under the name Second Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, which today is simply the Adventist Review. This is the general church paper and contains news of activities of the church around the world as well as devotional and doctrinal articles. There is a weekly edition as well as a monthly edition. It is printed at the Review and Herald Publishing Association in Hagerstown, Maryland. *The Youth’s Instructor, begun in 1852 by James White, has evolved into several age-related magazines to better meet the needs of the youth. Today the church publishes the Insight, Guide,<br>
Primary Treasure, Our Little Friend, and Sabbath School Lesson Quarterlies for all age groups. <br>

*At first, the mere mention of the word “organization” would bring very strong feelings and vocal negative opinions. The fact that many had been disfellowshiped from their previous churches had turned folk strongly against any formal church structure. However, as the movement grew in numbers and spread out geographically, it became more evident that church organization was becoming essential to safeguard against confusion and fanaticism, keep from becoming a one-leader cult, ensure continuity and focus to mission and resolve problems arising from property ownership legalities. <br>

In the 1850's those who preached the Advent message relied on the generosity of their listeners and worked when and where they could to support themselves. A group, under the leadership of J. N. Andrews, searched the Scriptures to find God’s method for the support of the ministry. The resulting recommendation was called systematic benevolence. The initial plan adopted called for each member to give annually at least 1% of all personal property free of debt, in addition to weekly free-will offerings. Until 1853 all literature was given away free and printed as specific donations were given. In 1853, James White suggested that the tracts be sold (the price of a full set was set at 35 cents by Loughborough), and in 1854 the Review was offered by subscription and the price of $1.00 per year 34 payable in advance. <br>

To understand the setting, here’s a quote illustrating much of the current thought of the times. George Storrs, a prominent leader in the movement, wrote: “Take care that you do not seek to organize another church. No church can be organized by man’s invention but what it becomes is Babylon the moment it is organized...” When tent ministry became an effective way of spreading the gospel, it required a full-time commitment of a large number of ministers. This was not possible without some regular form of support. Finances were therefore carefully studied and plans were voted. Then some suggested a form of organization was needed to hold church property. Opposition arose and accusations of “going back to Babylon ,” “union of church and state ,” “power mongers,” greed and position were all used as the debate became emotional rather than fact and necessary reality. Reality slowly won out, and at a general meeting held at the end of September 1860, the name “Seventh-day Adventist” was selected to represent the movement and a unanimous vote was taken for the formation of a publishing association. The Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association was officially formed on May 3, 1861. At this spring meeting it was also decided to issue certificates of ordination, and the churches in the state of Michigan were organized into a conference, with a chairman, secretary and advisory . *The Michigan Conference then met the following year and invited all other “state conferences” to meet in a general conference in the spring of 1863. Six states organized and sent delegates to the May 20- 23 meeting. At this meeting a General Conference constitution committee was appointed, and a state conference constitution committee was named. And, finally, John Byington was elected as the first president. A constitution of nine articles was adopted, and while others have been added since, no major changes have taken place within this document. At this time, there were 3,555 members in 125 churches. The ordained ministerial staff numbered twenty-two, with eight additional licensed workers.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

If the internal tensions were not enough, the fledgling church had to cope with a major external obstacle as well. The American Civil War was in full swing (1861-1865) precisely at the same time. Military service and normal disruptions created by warfare were major issues to deal with while attempting to keep a clear focus on the mission of the remnant church. Once the church was organized formally, one of the first immediate benefits appeared when the United States government granted noncombatant status to members (1864). <br>

As soon as the war was over, the church was again able to think expansion. While Michigan and the other states of the midcountry were considered “West ,” now the “far West” opened up new possibilities. A Macedonic call came from fourteen members living “way out there,” so at the General Conference session of 1868, Elders J. N. Loughborough and D. T. Bourdeau were appointed to go to the West coast. The work grew very quickly and spread into Western Canada as well. The Whites visited the Pacific coast in 1872. As a result of this trip and seeing the needs of the work in that area, they sold their home in Battle Creek and donated the money to the work there. By 1874 the first issue of Signs of the Times came off the presses of the west. Today nearly one third of the North American Division membership resides in the two Western unions. <br>

In 1865, Ellen White’s six pamphlets on health, based on an 1863 vision, were released. The need for this instruction was desperate; many of the pioneer leaders were in very poor health because of ignorance. While the believers had been active in temperance work, they were not fully aware of the positive aspects of healthful living. Continuing the same theme, in 1866 the magazine Health Reformer appeared as the church’s first health journal. <br>

As a direct result of a second vision on health received by Ellen White, a health institution was opened in 1866. It was first called the Western Health Reform Institute and later became world known as Battle Creek Sanitarium. It was paid for by personal pledges (James White and J. P. Kellogg gave $500 each) and became the first of what was to become one of the largest chains of medical institutions in the world. Dr. Kate Lindsay helped start a school of medicine at Battle Creek in 1883. <br>

Sporadic efforts had been made to establish church schools as early as 1853. Possibly the first of these was sponsored by John Byington, with his daughter, Martha, as teacher at Buck’s Bridge, New 36 York. The first official Seventh-day Adventist school anywhere in the world was begun in 1872 at Battle Creek by Goodloe H. Bell, a former patient of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. The school was the building that had originally been built for the press. Today the church operates more schools around the world than any other Protestant denomination. <br>

The early Adventists had held camp meetings prior to 1844, but the idea had fallen by the way due to public ridicule. Now, five years after the General Conference was organized, the idea was revived, and in 1868 the first Seventh-day Adventist camp meeting was held on a farm in Michigan with two thousand in attendance. In 1878 there would be 20,000 attending a camp meeting near Boston. Today these special meetings are held in many parts of the world, with some of the largest being held in East Africa. <br>

The first Sabbath school lessons had appeared in the Youth’s Instructor in 1852 and were written by James White. G. H. Bell, “the born teacher,” had experience in Sunday school work. So in 1869 he prepared two series of lessons for Sabbath schools. The next year a simple programming format was added and the Sabbath school was on its way. The first Sabbath school gifts to missions were sent to Australia (1885) and Africa (1887). Later, a ship was sent to the South Pacific; the “Pitcairn” plied the south seas for several years, taking missionaries to many islands. The population of Pitcairn Island today is entirely Seventh-day Adventist. At the close of the year 2000 the church statistics showed there were 14,548,500 Sabbath School members around the world. <br>

The Vigilant Missionary Society, formed in 1869, made one of its top projects the wider distribution of literature. Stephan N. Haskell saw possibilities in this kind of work and organized it on a broader basis. They soon became known as “tract and missionary societies.” Today’s offspring are known as the Publishing Department (Colporteur Ministry) and the Adventist Book Centers. At the General Conference of 1873 a Missionary Society was formed. As a result, missionary work (witnessing and outreach participation) among members increased. This society became the Lay Activities Department, then Personal Ministries.<br>

For several years “Macedonian” calls had been coming to the General Conference from Switzerland. M. B. Czechowski, a converted Catholic priest, had traveled out on his own under another sponsorship, spreading the message of the second advent along with other beliefs held by our church, including the seventh-day Sabbath. Finally, at the General Conference session of 1874 a significant official forward action was taken. John Nevins Andrews was appointed the first official overseas missionary and was sent to Switzerland. His son Charles, 17, and daughter Mary, 13, sailed with him; his wife had died in 1872. Soon after his arrival, the European Mission was organized. Andrews also reached Prussia (1875) and reported having found a group of 46 Sabbathkeepers there. <br>

Scandinavia was entered in 1877 by John Matteson, and a publishing house was opened two years later. D. T. Bourdeau was assigned to consolidate the work in France. His brother, A. C. Bourdeau worked in Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland and Romania. Philipp Reiswig, a man who was uneducated and with a speech impediment, was used in a special way by God to carry the message into Russia. <br>

William Ings went to England in 1878 and in only 16 weeks had ten people keeping the Sabbath. Later that same year, Elder Loughborough arrived to lead out, and in time the Stanborough Press and Newbold College were established. These countries each in turn became a home base, sending out missionaries to other lands.<br>

*The first young people’s society was organized in Hazelton Township, Michigan, in 1879, by two youth– Harry Fenner, 17, and Luther Warren, 14.&nbsp; Twenty years later (1899) the Ohio Conference became the first to form a conference-wide youth organization.&nbsp; It was known as *Christian Volunteers.&nbsp; In 1890 the first youth ministry related manual appeared under the title “Manual of <br>
Suggestions for Those Conducting Youth Meetings.”&nbsp; These ideas spread rapidly: by 1891 Youth Societies were formed in Wisconsin; by 1892, they had spread to Australia; by 1901, Missionary&nbsp; <br>
Volunteer membership cards were being issued, and by 1904 the first Manual of Young People’s Work appeared.&nbsp; To begin with, youth ministry came under the direction of the Sabbath School Department, but in 1907 the General Conference Youth Department was formally organized, and Elder M. E. Kern was appointed as director.&nbsp; <br>

In 1879 Ellen White was shown the need to circulate books as widely as possible among the public.&nbsp; Two years later, George King felt burdened to sell Uriah Smith’s book Daniel and the Revelation.&nbsp; The plan was very successful and introduced the colporteur ministry to the church.&nbsp; Today, thousands around the world either make their living through this ministry or earn school scholarships during the summer months.&nbsp; <br>

*The tithing system replaced the systematic benevolence plan in 1878.&nbsp; The new combination of tithes and book sales greatly strengthened all phases of ministry.&nbsp; The plans of tithes and systematic offerings have enabled the church to finance a worldwide mission and institutional development program.&nbsp; <br>

                          By 1883, twenty years after organization, the number of churches had increased over five-fold from the original 125 to 680, membership had jumped five-fold from 3,500 to about 17,500, and tithe now was ready to surpass the $100,000 mark.<br>
                           <br>e. <strong>WORLD VIEW BECOMES TRULY GLOBAL&nbsp; <br>
                           </strong> <br>
                          General Conference president George I. Butler visited Europe in 1884 and led in forming the European Conference.&nbsp; Ellen White also paid an extended visit to Europe the following year.&nbsp; <br>
                          *Australia received a party led by S. N. Haskell, M. C. Israel and J. O. Corliss, who were able to start a very strong work there in spite of considerable opposition.&nbsp; An early order of business was to open a publishing house in Melbourne.&nbsp; <br>
                          New Lealand was next to receiving the Advent Message when Elder Haskell went in 1885 and then A. G. Daniels traveled there in 1886.&nbsp; <br>
*Pitcairn Island opened up with a visit by John I. Tay in 1886, and the Fiji Islands were opened by J. E. Fulton, for whom now there is a college on the islands that bears his name.&nbsp; <br>
Africa received the message during the same year (1886).&nbsp; An excellent book (long out-of-print but still around) on the early years in Africa is Desert Track and Jungle Trail by Virgil Robinson.&nbsp; It was in 1894 that Pieter Wessels and a small delegation visited with Cecil Rhodes, Prime Minister of Cape Colony, requesting a piece of land for a mission in Rhodesia.&nbsp; Rhodes instructed the administrator in Bulawayo to permit the SDA representatives to select whatever land they needed– and Solusi College was born.&nbsp; <br>
In 1888 a humble man by the name of Abram La Rue went to Hong Kong as a self-supporting colporteur visited China and prepared the way for missionaries Edwin H. Wilbur and J. N. Anderson to enter China fourteen years later.&nbsp; <br>
f.&nbsp; <strong>A TIME TO REVIEW </strong> <strong><br>
                           </strong> <br>
During the 1860's and 1870's, Adventist evangelists were so busy proving that God’s law had not been abolished at the cross that they gave little attention to the “faith of Jesus” and stressed “the commandments of God.”&nbsp; There were also still some who held Arian views of Christ and who did not believe in the Trinity or in the personality of the Holy Spirit. With this background, the General Conference session of 1888, held at Minneapolis, Minnesota, became a very significant and pivotal meeting in our church history.&nbsp; A crisis had been reached and now dealt with.&nbsp; The decade following was marked by revivals and righteousness by faith was vigorously discussed and, by many, gratefully accepted.&nbsp; A full and well-documented study of this meeting has been published under the title Movement of Destiny, by Leroy Edwin from (Review, 1971).&nbsp; <br>
A number of new books written by Ellen White were introduced during this period, including The Desire of Ages and Steps to Christ designed to help correct erroneous teachings on the nature of Christ and endorsing the truth of righteousness by faith.&nbsp; <br>
g. <strong>INSTITUTIONAL EXPANSION&nbsp; <br>
                           </strong> <br>
The first SDA College outside of North America was opened near Cape Town, South Africa, in 1893 as the forerunner of today’s Helderberg College.&nbsp; Other early institutions overseas were:&nbsp; <br>
Signs Publishing Company&nbsp;&nbsp; Australia&nbsp; 1886&nbsp; <br>
Stanborough Press&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; England&nbsp; 1889&nbsp; <br>
Hamburg Publishing House&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany&nbsp; 1889&nbsp; <br>
Avondale College&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Australia&nbsp; 1897&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
h. ELLEN WHITE GOES TO <strong>AUSTRALIA&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                              <br>
In 1891 Ellen Whit</strong>e sailed for Australia and remained there for nine years (including several months in New Lealand).&nbsp; While there she founded Avondale College and encouraged the establishment of health food factories.&nbsp; The Sanitarium Health Food Company (1898) was established as a result and is today a very successful major supplier of health foods in the South Pacific, as well as a big financial backer of the South Pacific Division.&nbsp; <br>
i. FIRST UNION CONFEREN<strong>CE&nbsp; <br>
                              <br>
The first regional</strong> grouping of conferences to be formed as a Union Conference took place in Australia in 1894.&nbsp; Today there are 95 Unions in the world church, according to the 1997 statistical report.&nbsp; <br>
j. REORGANIZATION&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
T<strong>he General Confer</strong>ence of 1901 was one of the most significant sessions for the church and its structure.&nbsp; Major changes took place in the management structure, which gave much greater freedom of decisionmaking to the church at the local level, allowing for maximum expansion “into all the world.”&nbsp; Some of the changes that were instituted include:&nbsp; <br>
General Conference Committee was enlarged and made more representative.&nbsp; <br>
Union conferences/missions and local conferences/missions became the pattern of organization.&nbsp; <br>
Conferences were to share their tithes and offerings with the missions.&nbsp; <br>
Various independent organizations representing various interests of the denomination became departments of the General Conference.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
This 1901 session became known as the “turning point toward unity, reform, solvency and ardent evangelism”. <br>
                           <br>

                              <br>
k. PIONEERS CALL</strong>ED TO R<strong>EST&nbsp; <br>
James White died in </strong>1881.&nbsp; His death heralded an end to the era of the pioneers in America.&nbsp; <br>
John Byington–1887.&nbsp; The first president of the General Conference is buried next to the first Adventist in Battle Creek (David Hewitt).&nbsp; For his funeral, he had previously chosen as the text Revelation 3:21: “To him that overcometh....”&nbsp; <br>
John N. Andrews– 1883; J. H. Waggoner– 1889.&nbsp; Both are buried in Basel, Switzerland.&nbsp; <br>
Uriah Smith– 1903, longtime editor of the Review; his book Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation is still much used today.&nbsp; His death coincided with the end of the Battle Creek era as well.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
l. BRIGHT STARS DISAPPE<strong>AR&nbsp; <br>
                              <br>
D. M. Canright, a </strong>leading minister, left the church and became an ardent opposer of the movement.&nbsp; He died a broken and forgotten man.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
2.Dr. J. H. Kellogg, administrator of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, mixed pagan pantheism with the Bible, left and managed to take the hospital with him.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
m. FIRE DESTROYS INSTIT<strong>UTIONS&nbsp; <br>
                              <br>
For some time Batt</strong>le Creek was developing into an Adventist “cloister.” The members there were warned by God several times not to concentrate in one location but to scatter out and take the “Good News” with them.&nbsp; In 1893 they were warned that the institutions would be destroyed if they did not decentralize.&nbsp; In February, 1902, the main building of the sanitarium burned down.&nbsp; In December of the same year, the Review factory was destroyed by fire.&nbsp; Finally in 1903, Ellen White’s advice to move the headquarters east was heeded and property purchased near the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. <br>

By 1905 the overseas mission program was expanding as fast as persons were found who were willing to sacrifice. On every continent and throughout the oceanic regions, the Spirit of God was leading men to the light.&nbsp; <br>
Philippines entered by R. A. Caldwell in 1905 and J. L. McElhany in 1906.&nbsp; <br>
Greece entered by W. E. Howell in 1907.&nbsp; <br>
New Hebrides entered by C. H. Parker in 1912.&nbsp; <br>
Solomon’s entered by G. F. Jones in 1914.&nbsp; <br>
Highland Indians of South America received F. A. Stahl in 1909.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
Africa was witness to a rapid northward expansion of the gospel as missionaries from South Africa and America pushed northward through the then British colonies of East Africa.&nbsp; Names like Tarr, Campbell, Stockil, Anderson, and Sparrow all list under the pioneers.&nbsp; Today their descendants still continue in most of these countries.&nbsp; The Solusi graveyard is full of markers of these early pioneers, with the university itself a memorial.&nbsp; <br>
Each new venture, each new missionary cannot really just be listed as another statistic. The lives affected, the waves set in motion are still being seen and felt today amplified through many fascinating stories of God’s providential guiding.&nbsp; The student of church history will want to research more on this topic.&nbsp; <br>

In 1903 a lay member named Jasper Wayne experimented with an idea by giving away Signs of the Times and collecting donated money for missions.&nbsp; The idea caught on and is now an annual practice around the world, as funds are collected in support of the church’s humanitarian and educational work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. <strong>YOUTH MINISTRY&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br>
                           <br>
*In 1907, youth ministry came into its own when the new Young People’s Department was added to the General Conference and Elder M. E. Kern was named its first director.<br>
                           <br>
In the Central Union of the U.S. a little booklet was produced in the same year, with Bible texts listed for daily devotions.&nbsp; It was called the Morning Watch.&nbsp; It soon caught on and became a key part of the future Pathfinder Club.&nbsp; Also in 1907 youth received a new plan of study known as the Standard of Attainment, which was a forerunner of the Progressive– AY– Pathfinder classes.<br>
                           <br>
Reading Course plans for senior youth and junior youth were developed and offered by 1908.&nbsp; The Junior Society Lessons (1914) and the Junior Bible Year (1917) joined the resources available for youth ministry.<br>
                           <br>
By 1911 some members thought their children needed something more than the fare they had.&nbsp; They understood that children need to spend time in the outdoors, learn camping skills, with the accompanying benefits of independence, teamwork and relationship with their Creator that came with the new skills.&nbsp; One response to meeting these needs was the Takoma Indians Club in Maryland; another was the Mission Scouts in Tennessee (1919).<br>
                           <br>
In 1920, the General Conference saw the need of adding a Junior Youth Specialist to the Youth Department, and Harriet Holt was named to the position.&nbsp; She immediately set to work at experimenting with numerous ideas involving the children in outdoor activities, and in 1922 introduced the Progressive Classes, divided into two groups: two classes for Juniors, in what was called the JMV Society (Friend and Companion), and two classes for those youth who would become Junior Youth Leaders in an organization she called the Comrade Band (Comrade and Master Comrade).&nbsp; The last two were eventually changed to what is today known as Guide and Master Guide.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

A medical school had been established in Battle Creek, but it left with Dr. Kellogg and later had to close.&nbsp; In 1910, the church opened the College of Medical Evangelists in Loma Linda, California.&nbsp; The institution prospered, and in 1913 a clinic was opened in Los Angeles, which became White Memorial Hospital.&nbsp; CME, as the college became known, and renamed Loma Linda University, has become world renowned, and today is listed for many great accomplishments, including this stated by the American Medical Association: “one of the top three medical schools in the nation for training physicians how to help patients stop smoking.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong>The last major organizational step to take place after the Union and local Conference levels, done in 1901, came in 1913 when the world field was divided up into Divisions.&nbsp; Each Division president is a vicepresident of the General Conference.&nbsp; The administrators and departmental staff of both these levels are elected by the General Conference in session.&nbsp; With the expanding work and increasing expenses of transporting delegates, the time between sessions was first lengthened from annual to biennial, then to quadrennial, and in 1970 was voted to become quinquennial– every five years.<br>
                           <br>
It is good for students of church heritage and denominational structure to know the persons currently serving the church at the various relevant levels.&nbsp; Here is a place where you may write in the names of the persons at the General Conference and for your Division, Union, and local field (conference/mission) level who are responsible for the various areas of administration and ministry:<br>
                           <br>
Note: The SDA Yearbook, published annually, gives a full list of all officers and departmental persons at all levels, but for testing purposes, only those above need to be learned.&nbsp; All Master Guides should know who their Union and Conference presidents and youth directors are.&nbsp; <br>

Ellen White died on July 16, 1915 at the age of 87.&nbsp; Her last words spoken were “I know in whom I have believed.”&nbsp; <br>
*During her seventy years of ministry she wrote more than 100,000 pages, including more than 4,000 magazine articles and at least 8,000 manuscripts and letters.&nbsp; The total of her books today exceeds 120 volumes, including the Manuscript Releases (21 volumes).&nbsp; All of these, along with some additional materials, are now also on CD-ROM.&nbsp; Every year the number of languages also increases.&nbsp; All of the world’s major languages now have at least some of her books, and many of the lesser- known languages and dialects also have some of her materials in print.&nbsp; As was always her style, at the last General Conference she attended in 1909, she held out the Bible in her hand and said, “Brethren, I commend to you this book.”&nbsp; To this dedicated, peerless Adventist witness, the Bible was “the only rule of faith and practice.”&nbsp; Her death marked the end of an era, but the influence of her writings, as predicted, continue to guide the church: “the lesser light leading to the greater light.”&nbsp; <br>

From a one-country operation in the mid-1800, this church quickly grew and matured into a worldwide church by the first quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; This period included survival during World War I (19141918), and as this time period drew to a close, the church leadership also began to reflect the worldwide focus.&nbsp; When A. G. Daniels stepped down from the presidency in 1922, a leader with an international outlook was invited to step in, one who knew missions and understood the modified focus that came with it.&nbsp; W. A. Spicer had served in England and India and had been chairman of the Foreign Missions Board for over two decades.&nbsp; He once remarked in later life, “Only four years between 1900 and 1940 did not find me on a trip abroad.”&nbsp; <br>

J. N. Loughborough died in 1924, and one might think that with the death of the last of the pioneers, the movement might stagnate, crumble, fracture and finally disappear.&nbsp; That’s what happens to most ideologies or personality-centered movements.&nbsp; But the Personality guiding this one does not depend on specific individuals, and His ideology is eternal.&nbsp; See what happened:&nbsp; <br>
At the next General Conference session (1926) 150 workers were sent overseas to new fields of labor.&nbsp; Hospitals and/or schools and/or printing presses were opened in Ethiopia, Japan, Poland, Angola, Philippines, China, Malaya, Java, Trinidad and India.&nbsp; New missions were organized in the South Seas, Middle East, Cameroons, Brazil and the West Indies.&nbsp; <br>
The seed sown by the pioneers, watered by the Holy Spirit, bore fruit.&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong> <br>
All this occurred in a decade that also saw a worldwide collapse of the financial markets in what is known as the Great Depression.&nbsp; Elder C. H. Watson, president of the Australasian Division, was invited to be the General Conference president in 1930– the worst of times.&nbsp; He was noted for financial integrity and business acumen, and even though the next four years saw church income decrease by $54 million U.S., membership increased by 90,000, 48 missions were organized, and 654 additional workers employed.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, “The Lord blessed.”&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong> <br>
Youth Ministry filled in many of the components that continue to shape and guide the focus today.&nbsp; MV Weeks of Prayer began in 1924.&nbsp; The Junior Manual was translated into Chinese and Spanish in 1927.&nbsp; Sixteen Vocational Merits were introduced in 1928 (today’s Honors listing over 250). Another forerunner of Pathfinders began in Switzerland in 1939 (Advent Watch), and in the Pacific Northwest were the Trailblazers in 1942.&nbsp; Finally, in 1946 the first Conference-sponsored Pathfinder Club is born in California, and John Hancock designed the triangular emblem that is now recognized and worn with pride around the world by nearly two million Pathfinders. <br>
Numerous individuals in local churches had begun taking their children on camping experiences for several years, but the spiritual benefits of this type activity didn’t register with church leadership until the mid-Twenties.&nbsp; Australia held its first Junior Camp in 1925, and the following year (1926)camps were held in both Wisconsin (one for girls) and in Michigan (one for boys).&nbsp; They were so successful that the idea spread very quickly, even with very little support beyond a “blessing” from church administrators.&nbsp; Wilbur Holbrook recalled that for his first camps in Wisconsin and Illinois (1927) the conference loaned him $2.50 and when he was 50¢ short at the close, it was taken from his salary.&nbsp; Today, camping in all of its multiple forms is an integral component of youth ministry (with huge financial backing by the church) around the world, with many thousands of young people attending, as well as developing leadership skills while serving on the staff.&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong> <br>
The church had become involved with ships before, but they were used for transport only.&nbsp; In 1931Leo B. Halliwell and his wife, Jesse, introduced a revolutionary concept that has since been lauded and emulated by governments throughout the tropical world of the big rivers.&nbsp; The idea was to use boats as clinics to provide medical assistance in regions unreachable by more conventional means.&nbsp; The first and most famous of the launches was named Luzeiro I, which still serves on the Amazon and its tributaries.&nbsp; For their creativity and sacrificial work, the Halliwells were awarded the highest recognition the Brazilian government gives to civilians.&nbsp; Today, the church in Brazil still has more than a dozen medical boats plying its many rivers alongside government-sponsored boats.&nbsp; In other countries, such as Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and in Africa and Asia there are or have been at times other boats also taking healing and salvation to those who need and seek.&nbsp; <br>

To keep pace with rising standards of education, the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary was established in Washington, D. C. in 1936.&nbsp; In 1960 it became part of the newly named Andrews University in Michigan.&nbsp; Today, advanced degrees in many aspects of theology are taught in our numerous universities around the world.&nbsp; <br>

The church has never taken a position on establishing a creed, as some denominations have.&nbsp; However, in 1931, the church adopted a Statement of Fundamental Beliefs, which solidified our doctrines in many areas, and then in 1941 adopted a uniform baptismal certificate that included standardized questions of faith for candidates to agree to.&nbsp; <br>

The pioneer of religious radio broadcasting was Elder H. M. S. Richards, with his first broadcast occurring in 1926.&nbsp; His office was a converted chicken house, since the denomination did not accept the project until 1941.&nbsp; Today the Voice of Prophecy is the oldest continuing religious broadcast in the world and has sister broadcasts in many languages, countries, television, etc.&nbsp; Media broadcasting now covers more than 2,000 stations worldwide with weekly broadcasts; several high powered stations are owned by the church, and the number of local stations owned and operated by the church and members is constantly increasing.&nbsp; <br>

Mention should be made of this major interference that brought this period to a close.&nbsp; The war brought with it many obstacles to work around.&nbsp; Transportation was difficult, materials such as paper were in short supply, buildings and properties were destroyed, and workers were imprisoned or evacuated.&nbsp; Ideological changes resulting from the war closed many doors to the gospel for decades.&nbsp; However, God overrules in all obstacles, and the work prospered in unexpected ways and to unexpected degrees.&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong> <br>
The world– and the church– emerged from the war changed.&nbsp; National boundaries were different, politics were different, and society was different.&nbsp; This required change in administrative structures and divisions in order to more adequately meet these changes.&nbsp; Satisfactory and comprehensive reporting became impossible for some countries.&nbsp; Even travel was made more complicated by the introduction of entry and exit visas.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>

b. <strong>MISSIONS&nbsp; <br>
                           </strong> <br>
The focus of the gospel commission, however, did not die.&nbsp; Leadership determined that the frontiers of the gospel work must continue to expand despite problems.&nbsp; Places that had been evacuated were reentered, new countries were added yearly, and institutions sprouted everywhere.&nbsp; <br>
A sampling:&nbsp; a secondary school in Iceland– 1950 a <br>
hospital in Pakistan– 1951 an orphanage in Korea– 1951&nbsp; <br>

c. <strong>YOUTH MINISTRY&nbsp; <br>
                           </strong> <br>
Pathfindering went worldwide as it was accepted officially by the General Conference in 1950.&nbsp; The Junior Guide a magazine for pre-teens is introduced in 1953, and the first Pathfinder Camporee is held at Camp Winnekeag, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Puerto Rico and Mexico started Pathfinder clubs in the early fifties, but the first club to take the name “Conquistadores,” now recognized as the official Spanish name for Pathfinders, was organized in Lima, Peru in 1955. The first Pathfinder Club in Africa– Limbabwe (Northern Rhodesia) was established in 1959.&nbsp; <br>
d. <strong>NEW METHODS OF EVANGELISM&nbsp; <br>
                           </strong> <br>
Television became the newest technology, and the church was quick to react&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith for Today, conducted by W. A. Fagal began in New York in 1950; It Is Written joined in 1955; today, nearly 2000 T.V. stations carry weekly broadcasts.&nbsp; <br>
The new idea of Evangelistic Centers was introduced with centers opening in London and New York as a means of sharing the gospel in the big cities.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The magazine Israelite began publication 1954 four times a year, targeting those of Jewish tradition with topics tuned to their realities.&nbsp; <br>
e. <strong>STATISTICS&nbsp; <br>
                           </strong> <br>
As benchmarks of growth along the road of time, its interesting to stop and see what the figures indicate for the1950's (90+ years after the church formally organized).&nbsp; How has God led?&nbsp; <br>
 1955– Sabbath School offerings reach the cumulative total of $100,000,000&nbsp; <br>
 1956– Overseas Mission appropriations reach $21,000,000&nbsp; <br>
 1957– Radio broadcasts are made in 27 languages over 981 stations&nbsp;&nbsp; 1958– There are 102 major medical institutions, plus clinics, launches, etc.&nbsp; <br>
 1959– World membership tops the 1,000,000 mark, with tithes reaching $53,000,000&nbsp; <br>

Pathfindering went worldwide as it was accepted officially by the General Conference in 1950.&nbsp; The Junior Guide a magazine for pre-teens is introduced in 1953, and the first Pathfinder Camporee is held at Camp Winnekeag, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Puerto Rico and Mexico started Pathfinder clubs in the early fifties, but the first club to take the name “Conquistadores,” now recognized as the official Spanish name for Pathfinders, was organized in Lima, Peru in 1955. The first Pathfinder Club in Africa– Limbabwe (Northern Rhodesia) was established in 1959.&nbsp; <br>

Ellen White warned the church that as the end approaches, the work will have to be done under increasingly difficult circumstances.&nbsp; A listing of just a few of those would have to include the following:&nbsp; <br>
1. Strife, war, and jealousy among nations and tribes.&nbsp; <br>
 2. Instability in the business world.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
3. Accidents by land, sea and air.&nbsp; <br>
 4. Calamities in the natural world– floods, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.&nbsp; <br>
 5. Starvation and privation at unprecedented levels.&nbsp; <br>
 6. Undue nationalism and provincialism fragmenting society.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
Political strife and turmoil.&nbsp; <br>
Collapse of society through destruction of the family, loss of discipline, perversion of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morals.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
Because we, as church members, are also part of society around us, these things impact us as much as they do others.&nbsp; We are, sad to say, not insulated.&nbsp; We must therefore seek ways of preventing the negative influences of that which is within our spheres of action and help others cope with those negative influences over which there are no easy controls or solutions.&nbsp; Among God’s people there is to exist a spirit of love and brotherhood; though scattered among all nations, we are to be one from theory to practice.&nbsp; <br>
Just as John the Baptist was the herald of the first coming of the Lord, so the remnant church is to herald the second coming.&nbsp; The church has been able to keep pace with the technological age we live in by constantly finding ways of applying the new inventions to our mission.&nbsp; It would be very difficult to adequately summarize all these efforts into just a few paragraphs, but here are a few evidences of continued advance in the proclamation of the three angels’ messages:&nbsp; <br>
Based on 1997 data, more than 85 persons are joining the church every hour.&nbsp; <br>
Almost three new churches are being organized every day.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
3.Airplanes have joined the transport network, with planes operating in Africa and South America.&nbsp; Pathfinders even helped finance and assemble a plane that went into mission service at the beginning of the new millennium.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
4.Public evangelism has “gone out of this world” by broadcasting via satellite to churches&nbsp; and other gathering centers around the world, reaching ever-increasing hundreds of&nbsp; thousands in simultaneous live meetings.&nbsp; They have been called the “Net 90's.”&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
5.Five-day Plans to Stop Smoking have reached hundreds of thousands, creating a positive&nbsp;&nbsp; image of the church while helping people kick one of the most pernicious habits acquirable.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
6.New departments and services have been established at various levels of church&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leadership, including Stewardship, Trust Services, Family Life, Children, Women and, most recently, Global Mission, which has a mandate to identify and reach every unreached people group around the world.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
7.An agency designed to help those affected by disaster or extreme poverty was organized, first under the name of Seventh-day Adventist World Service (SAWS) then restructured as the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), and is a leader among voluntary agencies in helping those who find themselves in greatest need.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
8.State-of-the-art printing presses now produce many tons of books and periodicals&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annually.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
9.The educational system is still the largest Protestant parochial school system in the world, with 2000 data indicating 4,809 elementary schools, 1,126 secondary schools, 99 colleges and universities, with a total enrolment of more than a million.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
10.The Inter-American Division was well over the two million member mark by 2000,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Africa-Indian Ocean Division, East African Division and South American&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Division all between the 1.5 and 2 million mark each.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
11.In early 1978 the total world membership of the church reached 3 million; only 20 years&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; later, in 1998, the membership passed the 10 million mark.&nbsp; Members are now found in well&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; over 200 countries of the world (the UN lists 230).&nbsp; In 1978, the church had expanded&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; its influence through the use of 590 languages– by 1998, 735 languages were being used.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
12.Under 30 age group comprises more than 70% of the church membership.&nbsp; <br>
13.Missionaries continue to spread the Gospel to all parts of the world.&nbsp; <br>
These are but a few examples of the fulfillment of the commission to go “to every nation, and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kindred, and tongue, and people.”&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong> <br>
*The mission statement of the Communication Department is “building bridges of hope.”&nbsp; This is being accomplished by reaching the diverse church audiences, both within and externally, with an open, responsible and hope-filled communication program, and through the effective use of contemporary technologies and methods of communication.&nbsp; The desired effect of the Adventist communication vision and activities is to create a favorable image of the church, its mission, life and activities, and witness that many will become followers of Christ and become members of His church.&nbsp; <br>
The Communication Department of the General Conference dates back to 1972, when it was transformed from the former Bureau of Public Relations and the Radio-Television Department.&nbsp; Now, the department has these basic functions–news and information, public and media relations, and on-line services.&nbsp; This includes the operation of the Adventist News Network, a news agency established in 1994, as well as implementing the varied features of the church’s web-page on ‹www.adventist.org›.&nbsp; The department also oversees activities relating to the overall World Church communication strategy– “Seventh-day Adventists will communicate hope by focusing on the quality of life that is complete in <br>
Christ.”&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong> <br>
The Education Department provides coordination and supervision to the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist educational system, from the elementary school to the university level.&nbsp; Adventist educational institutions promote the total development of their students– mental, spiritual, and physical and social– and actively support the mission of the church.&nbsp; <br>
The first denominationally-sponsored Adventist elementary and secondary school began in Battle Creek, Michigan in 1872, and the first college opened in the same location in 1874.&nbsp; Since then, Adventists have established new schools, colleges and universities in over one hundred countries, with more than one million students enrolled.&nbsp; <br>
The Education Department publishes The Journal of Adventist Education in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish.&nbsp; The department also supports the church’s ministry on behalf of Adventist students attending public colleges and universities by publishing Dialogue, which is distributed free to them in the same four languages.&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong> <br>
The over-arching objective of the Department of Family Ministries is to strengthen families as disciplemaking centers.&nbsp; Established at creation, the family is the primary setting in which values are learned and the capacity for close relationships with God and with other human beings is developed.&nbsp; The department seeks to enable families to stretch toward divine ideals, while at the same time extending the good news of God’s saving grace and the promise of growth possible through the indwelling Spirit.&nbsp; <br>
Family Ministries focuses on people in relationship and is concerned with the needs of married couples, parents and children, the family needs of singles and all members of the wider family circle as they pass through life’s predictable stages and contend with unexpected changes in their lives.&nbsp; The department fosters growth opportunities through family life education and marriage and family enrichment programs.&nbsp; It supports and encourages families and family members to avail themselves of professional counseling when necessary to provide healing from abuse or other trauma.&nbsp; <br>
Specific tasks of the department include preparation of resources for Christian Home and Marriage Week and Family Togetherness Week, as well as resources and leadership development to equip pastors and lay leaders in a number of curricular content areas, such as premarital guidance, strengthening marriage, parent education, human sexuality, communication and family evangelism.&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong> <br>
Mission is the primary work of the church.&nbsp; As Seventh-day Adventists, we have a mandate to proclaim the name of Christ to every person in the world.&nbsp; To serve this objective nothing is more cutting-edge than Global Mission.&nbsp; <br>
In 1990, the world church created Global Mission, with the aim of establishing congregations in every unentered people group and territory in the world.&nbsp; From 1990 to 2000, the church has risen to meet the challenge.&nbsp; During this ten-year period, more than 15,000 new churches have been established, to say nothing of the additional thousands of new congregations. In 1990, our church was establishing one new church per day.&nbsp; In the year 2000, the church was establishing five new churches per day.&nbsp; The membership of the church has grown from 6 million to nearly 11 million members during the same time.&nbsp; Huge territories such as China, the former Soviet Union, India and the Middle East have experienced explosive church growth.&nbsp; It is clear that these accomplishments are a result of the power of the Holy <br>
Spirit.&nbsp; <br>
Global Mission’s mandate is clear.&nbsp; However, the only way the church can hope to meet the challenge of mission is through each member’s involvement–your involvement.&nbsp; Pray every day that the Holy Spirit will continue to prepare and reap the harvest.&nbsp; Find a way to personally impact mission.&nbsp; Remember the AY Aim: “The Advent Message to the entire World in My Generation.”&nbsp; <br>

                           <strong>The objectives are:&nbsp; </strong><br>
 To promote health and well-being of all members of the church and community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 To establish caring units such as hospitals, clinics, smoking-cessation support groups or even AIDS support groups in churches, schools or other Adventist and non-Adventist institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 To promote abstinence from harmful substances.&nbsp; Health Ministries seeks to establish, above all,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relationships with people regardless of race, gender, age or circumstances through which the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; healing power of God’s grace can be disseminated.&nbsp; <br>

This, in a sense, is the oldest of departments, for the publishing work dates back to 1849.&nbsp; The first steam press was paid for by a farmer selling his oxen.&nbsp; George King was the first literature evangelist, beginning in 1878.&nbsp; Today literature produced by fifty-eight publishing houses is being sold by 24,000 literature evangelists worldwide, totals over one hundred million dollars annually, and accounts for more than 60,000 baptisms each year.&nbsp; <br>

The Stewardship Department exists to train administrators and pastors in Biblical stewardship.

                           </strong> <br>
Women’s Ministries began in 1898 with the encouragement of Ellen G. White.&nbsp; However, it soon faded out because of the untimely death of the leader, Sarepta Myrenda (Irish) Henry.&nbsp; It was reactivated in 1990 and became a full department in 1995, so is both one of the newest and oldest departments.&nbsp; <br>
Women make up about 70% of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The spiritual growth of these women, regardless of age, is the first objective of Women’s Ministries, involving women ministering to and for women.&nbsp; <br>
Women’s Ministries supports and works to elevate women as persons of inestimable worth because they have been created and redeemed.&nbsp; It strives to build networks among women in the world church to encourage bonds of friendship and mutual support and the creative exchange of ideas and information.&nbsp; This involves the publishing of a yearly devotional book, the profits of which go entirely to scholarships for women.&nbsp; It fosters the mentoring of young Adventist women, encouraging their involvement in the work of the church.&nbsp; Women’s Ministries seeks to address the concerns of women in a global context bringing women’s unique perspectives to the issues facing the world church; seeks to expand avenues of dynamic Christian service for women; challenges each Adventist woman to find and use her spiritual gifts, working together with the men to further the global mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.&nbsp; <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;">l. <strong>YOUTH MINISTRIES&nbsp; <br>
                           </strong> <br>
*For several decades this department was known as the Youth Department of Missionary Volunteers <br>
(abbreviated as MV Department).&nbsp; In 1985 five departments were merged together– Family&nbsp; <br>
Ministries, Personal Ministries, Sabbath School, Stewardship and Youth– under the title of Church Ministries.&nbsp; This concept met with mixed success, and in 1995 some of the merged departments were again separated, with only Personal and Sabbath School Ministries staying together.&nbsp; Today we’re again known as the Youth Department and are commonly referred to as Youth Ministries.&nbsp; Aspects of youth ministry that are attended to by this department include:&nbsp; <br>
                           <strong>Adventurer Club</strong> (ages 6-9) with four age-related classes– Busy Bee, Sunbeam, Builder and Helping Hand; AJY Society and Pathfinder Clubs (ages 10-15) with six age-related classes– *Friend, Companion. Explorer, Ranger, Voyager, and Guide; AY Society and other young-adult-related organizations and activities designed for ages 16- 30's.&nbsp; <br>
*The purpose of the Youth Department is to aid in the harmonious development of the physical, mental, social and spiritual life of the youth and to train and organize them for Christian service.&nbsp; The key expression that permeates all youth ministry-related activities is “Salvation and Service.”&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
How this phrase translates into activity is outlined in such publications as the “Youth Leaders Handbook,” “Camp Directors Manual,” “Pathfinder Administrative Manual,” “Adventurer Club Manual,” “Camporee and Fair Manual”, etc.&nbsp; The department also produces a quarterly publication called Youth Ministry Accent with materials designed for church youth leaders at all levels.&nbsp; <br>
Various programs have been introduced through the years, each meeting the needs of the youth during the appropriate times.&nbsp; Some better-known ones are Friendship Evangelism in the fifties, Tell Ten in the sixties, Festivals of Faith in the seventies, New Beginnings in the eighties and ushering in the new millennium, a service-oriented program called Heart, Hand and Mind.&nbsp; <br>
Volunteerism took on new meaning and new directions beginning in the sixties with the Student Missionary program.&nbsp; First, colleges began sending students out as volunteers for several months or a year to help churches and institutions around the world; then academies and Pathfinder Clubs began sending groups out on building projects or to spend time helping at schools or orphanages, running Vacation Bible Schools and all sorts of other service-related activities from neighboring countries to local neighborhoods.&nbsp; <br>
World youth directors of the General Conference since the department was organized in 1907 are as follows:&nbsp; <br>
M. E. Kern&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1907-1930&nbsp; John Hancock&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1970-1980&nbsp; <br>
H. T. Elliott&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1930-1933&nbsp; Leo Ranzolin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1980-1985&nbsp; <br>
A. W. Peterson&nbsp;&nbsp; 1934-1946&nbsp; Dept. of Church Min.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1985-1995&nbsp; <br>
E. W. Dunbar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1946-1955&nbsp; Baraka Muganda*&nbsp;&nbsp; 1995-2010 <br>

As we have seen, during the years of development in the church organization, the evangelization of the world has not been forgotten.&nbsp; In the early days, with only a handful of workers and few scattered members with very limited means, the territory of the United States alone seemed far too large to reach with the message.&nbsp; But God had larger plans for His people.&nbsp; As fast as the church could follow, He opened one door after another.&nbsp; By the early 1900's all the major geographical areas of the world had been entered, and the church was fully, permanently committed to world evangelism.&nbsp; <br>
Pioneer missionaries, entering new lands, established mission stations, and there soon followed missions or fields, then conferences and unions.&nbsp; As early as 1916 Division organizations were formed. Since that time there have been various restructurings of these entities as new countries emerged and new political situations made cause for changes.&nbsp; The following information was provided by the Youth Department of each corresponding division.&nbsp; As of 1999, the divisions listed were:&nbsp; <br>

Today’s East Central Africa Division has arrived at its present status among the highest-membership divisions via often-complicated arrangements of structural management created by the constantly changing political situations.&nbsp; While the environment for managing and effectively coordinating the work has not been the most desired, God has still in His providence guided in the constant spreading of the gospel, regardless of political, racial and tribal turmoil.<br>
                           <br>
The 1921 Yearbook states that the “African Division” was “constituted by action at the Boulder [Colorado] Council, October 1919, not fully organized.”&nbsp; W. H. Branson was named president.&nbsp; There were only 2,200 members spread out through three unions of southern and eastern Africa.&nbsp; A later change caused the area to be called the Southern Africa Division, and Elder Robert H. Pierson was elected as president.&nbsp; This entity now included a wider range of east and central African countries and moved its headquarters from Cape Province, South Africa, to Harare (Salisbury), Limbabwe (Rhodesia).&nbsp; In 1968 a Trans-Africa Division was formed, which included the East African Union, to begin with, but then by 1970 the East African Union became part of the Afro Mideast Division.&nbsp; In 1983 there were two divisions: the Trans-Africa and the Eastern Africa.&nbsp; The territory of the EAD now covered Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Djibouti and Ethiopia.&nbsp; It was based in Nairobi, Kenya, and had as its president the first black African, Elder Bekele Heye.&nbsp; The Trans- Africa Division included South Africa, Lambia, Malawi, Limbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and Botswana, with headquarters still in Harare.&nbsp; Elder Kenneth Mitteider was president.&nbsp; 1983 was a pivotal point in all this.&nbsp; Both divisions were merged, forming a new <br>
Eastern Africa Division with headquarters in Harare.&nbsp; Included within its territory were Botswana, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Lambia, and Limbabwe.&nbsp; In 2003 a total restructuring of most of Africa brought in the new Division as it now stands with the countries of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and the Congo with over 2 million members total.&nbsp; <br>

The two divisions that cover Europe still reflect some of the turmoil of the past caused by the political upheavals of two world wars.&nbsp; As the “pie” now looks, this division includes Southern Europe, North Africa, and some countries bordering the Black Sea, Afghanistan and Iran – a total of twenty eight very diverse political entities.&nbsp; Some of the greatest challenges for Global Mission are found within the territories of this division, and at the same time some of the greatest breakthroughs are here, as well.&nbsp; One such case is the manner in which the church in Romania has exploded in recent years since the fall of Communism.&nbsp; Membership jumped from a small handful to nearly 72,000; Pathfinders went from zero to more than 5,000 in just over two years, and projections were to double the number by the turn of the millennium two years later.&nbsp; <br>

With the change of political winds in the 1980's came an opportunity to finally organize the work in the various countries of the former Soviet Union (excepting the Baltic republics).&nbsp; The division was organized in 1990 with about 37,000 members in 550 churches.&nbsp; Within only eight years, the division had grown to 130,000 members in 1500 churches.&nbsp; This division now is organized into five unions, twenty-five conferences and two attached fields; its headquarters are in Moscow.<br>
                           <br>
Through God’s guidance and protection displayed by a series of miracles, the Laokski Theological Seminary was established in 1988; a publishing house– Source of Life– was founded; the Adventist Health Center was established and the Voice of Hope Media Center began broadcasting.&nbsp; <br>

The largest division for over 20 years and baptizing new members at an average of over 400 per day gives a short view of how quickly the work is growing in this region “between the Americas.”&nbsp; The division comprises North America from Mexico to Panama, the South American countries of Colombia, Venezuela, and the three “Guianas,” and the Caribbean islands.&nbsp; <br>
It is the only division with its headquarters outside of the division territory (Miami, Florida).&nbsp; International transportation quirks and costs make it the most practical location.&nbsp; Four major languages are spoken: Spanish, English, French and Dutch.&nbsp; In spite of some high population densities, the ratio for its membership is lowest of all divisions at 1:13.&nbsp; It is said that if all the churches in the three conferences on the island of Jamaica were built in a row, there would be one every ¼ mile (0.44 Km.) In the island nation of Antigua-Barbuda, over 1% of the island population is a Pathfinder.&nbsp; <br>

The territory of the North American Division includes Bermuda, Canada, the French possession of St. Pierre and Miquelon, the United States of America, Johnson Island, Midway Islands and all other islands of the Pacific not attached to other divisions, and is bounded by the dateline on the west, by the equator on the south and by longitude 120 on the east.&nbsp; This division, with 4,718 churches, 368 companies and 879,829 members, is divided into nine unions (1997 data).&nbsp; In 1997 the total population in this territory was 297,609,586.<br>
                           <br>
The North American Division is blessed to have the World Headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church situated within its borders in Silver Spring, Maryland.&nbsp; It still maintains the special arrangement with the General Conference that it had before becoming a full-fledged division.&nbsp; The NAD has a president, secretary, treasurer, three vice-presidents and department directors who oversee the work of the division.&nbsp; The three top officers also serve as associates in the General Conference.&nbsp; No other division has this arrangement.<br>
                           <br>
There are six universities, nine (tertiary level) colleges and 1,044 primary and secondary schools operated in the North American Division.&nbsp; There are more than one hundred hospitals, nursing homes and retirement centers.&nbsp; Two large publishing houses, the Pacific Press and the Review and Herald, serve both the North American Division and the world field.<br>
                           <br>
Many institutions in the North American Division help to make it a training and supply center for the world.&nbsp; In 1997 there were 619 NAD employees working as interdivision employees (formerly called missionaries) serving in overseas divisions.&nbsp; Of these 619, there were 142 serving in the medical work.&nbsp; This division had more interdivision employees serving in other countries than all the other divisions combined.&nbsp; Also in 1997 there were 289 Adventist Volunteers serving in other countries.&nbsp; There were 83 young Task Force volunteers serving within the North American Division.&nbsp; <br>

*The former Far Eastern Division, which was organized in 1919 and renamed Asia-Pacific Division in 1995, comprised the following unions: Bangladesh, Korea, Japan, South China Island, Myanmar, East Indonesia, West Indonesia, North Philippine, Central Philippine, South Philippine, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka Union of Churches and the attached field of Guam-Micronesia.<br>
                           <br>
In 1997, this vast expanse was divided between the north and the south.&nbsp; The northern region became the new NSD and includes the following territories: The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Japan, Macau, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and has added to it the countries of Mongolia and the People’s Republic of China.&nbsp; This new division, with a population of 1.5 billion, is the largest concentration of people of any division of the world field.&nbsp; There are 421,000 members and 1,450 churches as of 1998, comprising the Japan and Korean Union Conferences, the South China Island Union Mission and the East Asia Association.<br>
                           <br>
The Northern Asia-Pacific Division operates one university, four colleges, 37 secondary schools, four food industries, eight hospitals, one health center, three nursing homes/retirement centers, three publishing houses, four Bible correspondence schools and 38 English language schools.&nbsp; <br>

The South American Division was organized in 1916 and has its division offices in Brasilia, the capital of <br>
Brazil.&nbsp; This division now has nine unions: Austral, Bolivian, Central Brazil, Chilean, East Brazil, North Brazil, Northeast Brazil, Peruvian and South Brazil.&nbsp; It also has two attached fields in Ecuador that may soon become the tenth union.&nbsp; The 2000 statistics showed 6,387 churches accommodating 1,701,600 members. This division has many schools, hospitals, clinics and other related institutions.&nbsp; It also has a very active program with medical launches, airplanes and rolling clinics.&nbsp; There are a number of orphanages, elderly-care facilities, and two publishing houses.&nbsp; The South American Division is considered the first-ranking division in its educational work and literature evangelism.&nbsp; The division also has four universities among its institutions of higher learning, which are all recognized by their respective governments and are ranked among the best in their countries.&nbsp; A fifth university in Brazil is now even operating on two fully-equipped campuses with maximum enrollments.&nbsp; In Brazil, at the time of this edition of this manual, a new school was being opened on the average of every five weeks.&nbsp; Brazil and the Philippines (SSD) were in a “friendly race” toward becoming the first million-member country.&nbsp; Brazil was the first to report having attained that goal at the 2000 G.C. session in Toronto, Canada.&nbsp; <br>

Statistics don’t tell the whole story of any division.&nbsp; The SPD is certainly one that would need more than a few paragraphs to illustrate even the basics.&nbsp; Within its five unions are more than 304,000 members scattered across a continent and nearly unnumbered islands of the blue Pacific.&nbsp; Some of these islands have the highest membership/population ratios in the world.&nbsp; As a whole, the Western Pacific Union has a ratio of 1:22.5; within it, however, is the West Solomon Islands Mission with a ratio of 1:6 in 79 churches.&nbsp; <br>
As has been mentioned in previous sections of this manual, the work began early in this part of the world; it was early reinforced by a strong educational program and backed financially by a large food industry.&nbsp; While there were setbacks during World War II, the work never slowed down much, especially in the island nations.&nbsp; Today the biggest challenge facing the division is the secularization of Australia, which has always served as the operating and financial base.&nbsp; <br>

The Southern Asia Division today is exclusively the countries of India and Nepal.&nbsp; Though it lost the Unions of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma (Myanmar), Afghanistan and Sri Lanka to other divisions in 1986, it has been able to more than double its membership of 134,000 at that time to its present membership (2000) of over 350,000 worshiping in more than 1,000 churches.&nbsp; <br>
 Additionally, the church has a significant presence in the form of auxiliary institutions, with 294 schools, 4 colleges, 12 hospitals and clinics, a publishing house and two orphanages.<br>
                           <br>
The division offices are now located at Hosur, Tamil Nadu, having moved from Poona in 1989.&nbsp; Poona however, is still a major center for the church with the presence of Spicer Memorial College, Oriental Watchman Publishing House, Adventist Media Center, a hospital, four schools and the Central India Union headquarters.&nbsp; There are now six unions in the division, which illustrates the rapid growth over the past few years.&nbsp; The first conference was organized in 1993; since then four more sections (fields) have been moved up the scale to conference level as well.&nbsp; In India alone there are now about one billion people, with 84% Hindus, 11% Muslims, and 3.5% other religions.&nbsp; Christians form a small minority of 2.4% of the total population.&nbsp; In spite of this, the work of the gospel is being aggressively pushed forward, with plans to construct a thousand new churches during the three- year period surrounding the turn of the millennium.<br>
                           <br>
The following is a brief synopsis of the beginnings of the work in India:&nbsp; William Lenker and A. T. Stroup, two literature evangelists, were the first to bring the message to India back in1893. Two years later the first full-time missionary– a lady by the name of Georgia Burrus arrived.&nbsp; Only 24 years later the Southern Asia Division was created (1919).&nbsp; A school was founded in Coimbatore in 1915 by G. G. Lowry, which grew and was eventually moved to Poona, becoming then the now famous Spicer Memorial College.&nbsp; Publishing work began in 1896, and today the publishing house produces material in 14 of India’s languages.&nbsp; Radio broadcasts from the media center are now programming ten languages.&nbsp; <br>

The other half of the former Far Eastern Division, the SSD spreads over seven time zones, seventeen political entities and twenty-one thousand islands.&nbsp; Indonesia alone has over 13,000 islands, with more than 6,000 of them inhabited.&nbsp; “The gospel to the entire world” is a particularly interesting challenge to the one million members as they seek ways of reaching the 655+ million total populations of these countries.&nbsp; <br>

Before the third angel’s message came to John Byington’s attention, he was prominent in the Methodist Church and later became a Wesleyan minister.&nbsp; It was not an easy matter for him to accept the Sabbath, but he chose to obey the plain “Thus saith the Lord.”&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
His farm provided a station for the “Underground Railroad,” giving food and shelter to escaping slaves.&nbsp; He was a tall, dignified man of few words but definite and well-chosen.&nbsp; He was often called Father Byington because he was the oldest among the Adventist leaders at the time.&nbsp; He became president at the age of seventy-one.&nbsp; His main focus as president was to urge harmony and unity among believers.&nbsp; Born in 1798, he died just past the age of 88 and had chosen for his funeral the text found in Revelation 3:21: “To him that overcometh....”&nbsp; <br>

The second president of the General Conference was one of the most tireless workers of the movement.&nbsp; Born in 1821, he traced his heritage to the pilgrims of the Mayflower.&nbsp; He began attending school at the age of 16, studied 18 hours a day and completed all the formal education he would have in about threeand-a-half years.<br>
                           <br>
At the age of 21 he accepted Miller’s teachings and immediately began preaching, converting more than one thousand people during a trip that lasted six weeks. In addition to being a good leader and a powerful preacher, James also possessed the gift of song.&nbsp; He assembled the first hymnal, wrote the first paper, Present Truth, founded the Review and Herald, and started the Youth’s Instructor and the Signs of the Times.&nbsp; He organized the doctrines of the church, the structure of the denomination, and helped establish a number of institutions.&nbsp; He died in 1881 two days after turning sixty years old.&nbsp; <br>

John Andrews had one of the most brilliant, analytical minds of the movement.&nbsp; At the age of five, he heard a sermon he remembered the rest of his life.&nbsp; His strength of character is shown by an incident when he was 14 years old.&nbsp; In Maine, an Adventist meeting convened near a stream and bridge.&nbsp; At the close, he and an elderly man started across the bridge but were met by a hostile mob.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
A man with a whip struck the old man, but John intervened, saying very stoutly, “We are commanded to bear one another’s burdens.&nbsp; If you whip Brother Davis, you whip me, too!”&nbsp; Awkward and confused, the bully admitted “It’s too bad to whip a boy” and let them pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
John mastered Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, German and Italian.&nbsp; He memorized the New Testament and at the age of 21 joined the publishing committee of the Advent Review.&nbsp; One of his greatest contributions to the church was a 342-page History of the Sabbath.&nbsp; A second great contribution and the one he is most remembered for was the fact that he was our first missionary– to Europe in 1874.&nbsp; He died of tuberculosis at the age of 54, and his remains are still in his adopted home of Switzerland.&nbsp; <br>

When George Butler was but a child, his parents joined the Millerite movement and opened their home as a meeting place for believers.&nbsp; He was the grandson of the governor of the State of Vermont.&nbsp; At the age of 31 he was an earnest young layman, farmer and elder of the church in Waukon, Iowa.&nbsp; The administration of the Iowa Conference joined a dissident movement, so the constituency licensed him as a minister and then elected him president of the Iowa Conference (1865).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
He was the first president to travel overseas while in his post. It was during his term of office that the church made a step forward that would forever leave a major impression on its membership– education– the first school was founded. During an interim when James White was again president, he returned to the presidency of the Iowa Conference.&nbsp; He was so wrapped up in his work that at the close of his second term, he required a complete rest, but again in 1901 he was asked to be president of the Florida Conference.&nbsp; Then the next year he took the reigns of the Southern Union.&nbsp; He continued a heavy schedule of preaching and writing until his death in 1918.&nbsp; He lived to see one of his very first converts– A.G. Daniels– become president of the General Conference.&nbsp; <br>

At just five years of age Ole Olsen immigrated to America with his family from Skogen, Norway; thus he became the first foreign-born president.&nbsp; At the age of 29 he became president of the Wisconsin Conference; then followed the Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa conferences.&nbsp; In 1886 he was invited to go to Scandinavia to oversee the work there.&nbsp; At the age of 43 he was elected president of the General Conference for nine years, served a year in Africa opening work among new tribal groups, then returned to the European continent, Great Britain, Australia and finally retired in America, working among immigrants.&nbsp; Considered “one of the most loved leaders,” he died suddenly while still working (1915).<br>
                           <br>
When the church appointed him as president of the world church, he was not present but rather working diligently in Norway as president and evangelist of the Norwegian Conference.&nbsp; His diary had an interesting entry– “received word from the brethren” – as to his appointment.&nbsp; But he didn’t leave right away; he was doing God’s work where he was.&nbsp; Then one day five months later, his diary reads “Leaving today for America to take up duties at General Conference.”&nbsp; To modest, unassuming O. A. Olsen, it made no difference whether he was serving the church as a preacher somewhere or president of the world church.&nbsp; <br>

At the age of seventeen, Irwin joined the 20<sup>th</sup> Ohio Volunteer Infantry– and the Civil War.&nbsp; Fighting seventeen battles under Generals Grant and Sherman, he was finally captured near Atlanta, Georgia, and sent to the infamous Andersonville Prison.&nbsp; Here, amid all the stench, misery and death, he was converted.&nbsp; He survived prison, was released at the close of the war, and went back home to Ohio, where he accepted the message and became a charter member of the Mt. Vernon, Ohio SDA Church, now age 44.&nbsp; Four years after joining the church, he was elected president of the Ohio Conference.&nbsp; He was asked to be part of a committee of three and return south in search of a site for a school– today’s Oakwood College (named for 65 huge oak trees they found on the farm).&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
At the General Conference Session held at Lincoln, Nebraska in 1897, thirty-eight conferences and five mission fields were now represented.&nbsp; Irwin insisted that the ministry should not be tied to business matters; it consumed time that should be spent on the gospel work.&nbsp; Laymen “of honest report” should be elected to fill the business needs of the church.&nbsp; After he had given four years of work at the General Conference the constituency entered the Restructuring Session of 1901.&nbsp; Irwin and Daniels exchanged places, with Irwin going to Australia to head the work there.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
Irwin was always generous with whatever money he had.&nbsp; He helped finance a school in the South, a church in Atlanta, Oakwood College, and numerous students.&nbsp; His philosophy was based on the parable of the pearl of great price: “It will take all to buy the field.”&nbsp; George Irwin finally rested at the age of 68 in 1913.&nbsp; <br>

At the age of 36, Arthur Daniels became the first president of the church’s first Union conference, established in Australia.&nbsp; Then, at age 43, he was elected president of the General Conference and served in that capacity longer than any other we’ve had (21 years).&nbsp; He was a most dynamic leader, with a vision of the mission field scarcely dreamed of before.&nbsp; He had spent many years with Ellen White as a mentor developing the work in the South Pacific, using his rich experience and youthful enthusiasm to guide the church through a process of reorganization that spread much more authority and responsibility out to the local fields, enabling them to move much more quickly in the spread of the gospel.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
Few would have guessed that Daniels started out as a shy lad with a speech impediment.&nbsp; His father, a physician, fought and died in the bloodiest battle of the civil war–Antietam.&nbsp; His mother remarried a rancher, so Arthur grew up thinking he would become a farmer.&nbsp; At age 16 he thought being a teacher would be better and went to Battle Creek College.&nbsp; After getting married, he found himself in Texas working with evangelist Elder Kilgore as his tent master and with help overcoming his speech problems.&nbsp; James and Ellen White came to Texas that fall and stayed all winter, becoming lifelong friends with Arthur and his wife, Mary.&nbsp; One of Daniels’ early converts was Mrs. Flora Plummer, who later became the first Sabbath School Secretary of the General Conference, serving 35 years there, and is also well remembered within youth ministry for her early contributions that eventually led to the organizing of the Youth Ministry Department.&nbsp; While in Australia, Daniels was the first evangelist to visit New Lealand in support of the believers who were already meeting there.&nbsp; Daniels wrote three books, the last of which was finished as he lay on his death bed: The Abiding Gift of Prophecy in 1935.&nbsp; <br>

Spicer’s very first appointment for the church was to go to England and work with S. N. Haskell.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
 He had to leave a new-found sweetheart behind and wait with heavy heart for nearly two years before he had earned enough to invite her to come to England to be married.&nbsp; Later a call came to go to India, where he served as editor of the Oriental Watchman, was for a time the only ordained minister in the country, and then back to the U. S. as secretary of the Mission Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
The Battle Creek fires brought on the transfer to Maryland, and the Spicers were the second family to make the move.&nbsp; He had been appointed as General Conference Secretary (age 38) and served in that capacity the entire term of Arthur Daniels’ presidency, replacing him when he retired.&nbsp; The records show that Spicer had been overseas every year but four from 1900-1940.&nbsp; These trips often took several months and is an indication of his commitment to seeing that the work continue the same pace as that set during the years of his predecessor.&nbsp; He passed away in Takoma Park in 1952, nearly 87 years after his birth in Minnesota.&nbsp; <br>

Watson was the first Aussie to become Australasian Division (SPD) president and then the first Aussie to become General Conference president. Born in Yambuk, Victoria, west of Melbourne, raised his early life in a frugal, tough environment of hard work prepared him for God’s future assignment as president during the most difficult economic period of our history.&nbsp; Yet, as seen in an earlier section of this manual, it was a period of progress and successes in spite of the financial chaos in the world.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
Watson was first able to practice his business acumen by running his father’s store.&nbsp; Later he would apply sound financial practice to funds loaned by members to form a pooled resource for the building of institutions and churches.&nbsp; Applying proper business principles in the development of the food industries became another challenge met successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp; While in the area of evangelism, he traveled across the South Pacific islands, expanding and solidifying the work.&nbsp; During the depression, the church-employed staff was cut by 50%, but the work was not slowed up.&nbsp; Rather, 90,000 new converts came in during this period, 48 new missions were established, 1,000 new churches were built, and 184 new countries and islands received the message comprising 122 new languages.&nbsp; At the close of his term, the Watsons returned to Australia, where he continued in division leadership until his retirement in 1944.&nbsp; He died the day before Christmas in 1962, age 87.&nbsp; <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Young Lamar McElhany’s first encounter with Mrs. White was while he attended Healdsburg College in California.&nbsp; In response to his question regarding the 144,000, she said, “I would not tell you if I did know.”&nbsp; He was surprised, but later understood when he read “When men...are curious to know something it is not necessary for them to know, God is not leading them...It is not His will that they shall get into controversy over questions which will not help them spiritually, such as, Who is to compose the hundred and forty-four thousand?”&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
McElhany began his 58 years of service to the church as a colporteur.&nbsp; As he came from a very close, tight-knit family, the call to overseas service was difficult to accept and often brought severe loneliness to his soul, but travel he did, first to Australia, then to the Philippines, then to New Lealand and, finally, after several years, back to the U.S., where he served as hospital chaplain, then president of several conferences.&nbsp; He was gifted with a rare blend of kindness and firmness and has been likened to a surgeon who can perform major surgery, yet leave but a very small scar.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
In 1926 he was elected vice-president for North America (equivalent to president of the North American Division today) and ten years later was chosen to be president of the General Conference.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
 Later, looking back, with his normal humbleness, he commented that the best position he ever held was in his youth as tent master for a couple of evangelists.&nbsp; After his third term as president ended, he continued as a general field secretary until his death in 1959.&nbsp; Shortly before his death, during a hospital stay, an attendant asked him how he liked being president so many years.&nbsp; His typically honest answer was “I did not like it...it wore me out.”&nbsp; <br>

Elder Branson’s youth was characterized by diligent study and a love for cooking.&nbsp; His desire to work for the church won over becoming a chef, but he always loved to do the cooking for guests who would visit.&nbsp; He was ordained at the age of 23, became president of the South Carolina Conference at the age of 24, of the Cumberland Conference at age 26, of the Southern Union at the age of 28, and of the African Division at the age of 33 (seems times were different then!).&nbsp; The entire continent had a magic appeal to him-- he often slept on the open ground, used tree bark for dishes, and employed every imaginable form of transport, but covered the continent seeking places and ways to spread the gospel.&nbsp; In a short time he wrote two books as motivators to other youth who would choose to work on this great continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
He was long recognized as an able administrator and powerful preacher, so after ten years of hard, satisfying work in Africa, he was asked to become a vice-president of the General Conference (age now 43).&nbsp; He worked hard but also knew how to relax and insisted on never mixing business and relaxation.&nbsp; He loved gardening, had a small boat and was never so relaxed as when he’d go camping, cooking over a campfire and sleeping under the stars.&nbsp; His father-in-law once remarked “Next to the Lord, Will Branson is the truest and greatest, the kindest and best man that ever lived”.&nbsp; From 1938 on he served first in Europe, then in China.&nbsp; When in 1950 he was invited to be the president of the General Conference, his response was “I have always had very high ideals regarding the type of man who should stand as the leader of God’s people... I have never felt that I could personally measure up to that standard, I have no natural abilities....” But when all was said and done, he concluded, “I have never felt free to say ‘no’ when... asked to undertake any task.”&nbsp; His secretary once wrote to friends, “I have never known anyone more prolific and versatile, and withal a genial disposition.”&nbsp; During his presidency, he developed Parkinson’s disease and resigned at the 1954 session in San Francisco.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his last sermon to the delegates, his urge was still “The whole business of the church is to save souls.”&nbsp; He died in 1961.&nbsp; <br>

Born in Wisconsin, Figuhr was of that large immigrant movement of Germans who had left Germany in the early-to-mid 1800's, gone to Russia and then a generation later had to move again to the states of the north-central plains of the U. S.&nbsp; He was fluent in four languages including English, German, Tagalog and Spanish.&nbsp; His service included 18 years in the Philippines (ten of them as president of the Union) another nine years as president of the South American Division and four years as a general field secretary of the General Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
During his presidency, the church reached its first million in membership and saw an additional half- million join.&nbsp; When he was elected, the delegates represented 109 countries and several hundred languages.&nbsp; His travels took him to some of the most remote places of the earth, logging two million miles by air in addition to countless miles by bus, train, and even using water buffalo for transport.&nbsp; In one instance he had to ford a river more than fifty times to reach his appointment.&nbsp; He was laid to rest to await his Lord’s coming in 1983.&nbsp; <br>

Robert Pierson’s style of servant leadership might best be illustrated by an incident that occurred shortly after his retirement from official duties.&nbsp; He was invited to be the guest speaker for a series of deacon and elders’ meetings followed by minister’s meetings at Camp Alamisco on Lake Martin in Alabama.&nbsp; There were only a few hours on Sunday between the two sets of meetings for the camp crew to clean up and have everything ready for the second group.&nbsp; The camp director had just begun preparing the large meeting hall when Pierson happened by and offered to take over the cleaning, freeing up the director for other urgent work.&nbsp; When the director protested that Pierson was a guest and should take the opportunity to relax a bit and enjoy the beautiful lake, Pierson’s response was, “I hear whoever doesn’t work doesn’t eat; now me tell what needs to be done.”&nbsp; He then proceeded to mop, wax, and polish and set up the 200 chairs while the rest of the staff worked feverishly on other assignments.&nbsp; While humility was perhaps not unique to the man among presidents, he was indeed a special person practicing what he preached.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
He was born in Iowa as a fourth-generation Adventist in 1911.&nbsp; His father, though, was a Methodist and bank president.&nbsp; He enjoyed writing, and at the age of twelve had one of his poems published-- a sevenstanza story of Lindbergh’s flight across the Atlantic.&nbsp; He also loved sports: in high school he was captain of both his football and track team.&nbsp; He also played basketball and baseball and did some boxing.&nbsp; He thought little of studies beyond high school. Then his mother died, and his life took a different turn.&nbsp; He married his high school sweetheart, and both went to Southern Missionary College, where she taught part time elementary classes and he milked cows to pay their way through school and degrees in Theology and Education.&nbsp; Eight years after leaving college (now age 30) he was named president of the South India Union.&nbsp; From there he returned to New York, where he maintained a daily radio broadcast, and in 1944 was called to be president of the British West Indies Union.&nbsp; Six years later he returned to India as Division president.&nbsp; While there he became the first SDA minister to enter the mountain kingdom of Sikkim.&nbsp; In 1958 he became president of the Trans Africa Division and was among those trapped in the middle of the Katanga/Congo war, with shrapnel often flying inches away.&nbsp; He later admitted, by quoting 2 Corinthians 1:10, “It was God who preserved us from imminent death” (Phillips).&nbsp; Finally, due to his doctor’s advice, he retired from official duties in 1979, but then served as a volunteer pastor in a church back in the Caribbean for some time.&nbsp; While pastoring in Hawaii, Pierson died in 1989 at the age of 78 of that heart attack predicted by his doctor ten years before.&nbsp; <br>

The son of missionaries, he spent many years in Africa and India, then added the Middle East, where he was president of the Egypt Mission for five years and of the Nile Union for eight.&nbsp; He was active in negotiating the opening of SDA work in Libya, Sudan and Aden.&nbsp; Eventually he became president of the Columbia Union in the U.S., and from there president of the North American Division by 1966.&nbsp; At the Annual Council of 1978, when Elder Pierson resigned, Elder Wilson was appointed as his replacement, effective January, 1979.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
As president of a world organization now numbering several million and increasing by the millions, Elder Wilson often found himself in interviews and negotiations with heads of state from countries around the world, seeking ways in which the SDA church could more effectively serve and share its unique ministry.&nbsp; He was instrumental in obtaining formal recognition of the church in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, participated in the negotiations for the establishment of a theological seminary and publishing house for the newly organized Euro-Asia Division, and sought through high-level meetings to obtain a degree of religious toleration in many countries where such had been very limited.&nbsp; <br>
 Upon retirement after eleven years, he continued to hold many key committee functions on a volunteer basis, lending his world political expertise to the church for yet many years.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
One of his personal attributes that held him in very high esteem by many church members around the world was his unusual ability to recall acquaintances and details often many years later.&nbsp; He had a prolific memory of chance encounters and small incidents that would often be recalled years later, to the astonishment of those involved.&nbsp; This same ability was also used to good advantage, as he was able to keep a clear view of the ever-growing pulse of the church in all its myriad details around the world.&nbsp; <br>

Folkenberg, born in Puerto Rico of missionaries in 1941, was the first president certified to fly multiengine airplanes and helicopters, a certified scuba diver, ham radio operator, etc.&nbsp; He was an entrepreneurial leader who was able to obtain grants from many governments for health and educational projects in Central America during his years there. He also secured funding for radio stations in several countries in Central America and the Caribbean.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
Folkenberg brought the church into the technological age by tying in churches all over the world through satellite T.V. and the internet.&nbsp; World evangelism took on a new meaning with worldwide campaigns via satellite, using multiple translations, reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

The second Norwegian (born in Narvik, 1935) to become president, Paulsen served the church in his home country, England, and sub-Saharan Africa and as the longest-serving president of the TransEuropean Division.&nbsp; During his term in TED, he was instrumental in strengthening and expanding the work in several countries of Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism, including Albania, which had been completely closed to religion until 1990.&nbsp; <br>
While his administrative talents have been long recognized by the church, he prefers to be known as a scholar in the field of theology and missiology. He was the first Adventist to earn a Doctor of Theology degree from the Protestant faculty of any German university (Tubingen University- 1972).&nbsp; Over the years he has published numerous papers and a book on his favorite themes.&nbsp; <br>

First we studied the development of the work in broad chronological strokes; then we looked at its various phases of activity and geographical components to get a clearer picture.&nbsp; But our church didn’t develop by phases nor by segments in a coordinated, methodical pattern; it grew as the Spirit of God moved on the minds of men in different places and in different manners to meet the needs of the gospel commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Geography, phases, concepts and people are all intertwined throughout the growth and history, creating a strong web of faith in the soon return of Christ encircling the globe. Following is a brief chronological summary for easy reference (obviously, space limits its completeness and regions may wish to add those dates that are important to them).&nbsp; <br>

                           </strong>Pieter Wessels a young South African living in Kimberly began to keep the Sabbath. He concluded from various bible studies he had that the seventh (7<sup>th</sup>) day was the Sabbath. He thought that he was the only person in the world keeping the Sabbath- commandment. A month later G.J. Van Druten visited him and told him of the miner from the United States of America named William hunt who was a Seventh – day Adventist. Pieter Wessels met hunt who later explained to him about seventh day Adventist church and its organization in America. Eager to know more about the Bible, Pieter Wessels and van Druten appealed to the general conference for a Dutch minister to come and teach them more about the bible and other doctrinal precepts then baptize them.<br>
                           <br>
To quicken the dispatch of this missionary to South Africa, they contributed money and sent it to the general conference. This was known as the 1886 Macedonian call from South Africa. In response to this call, the general conference of the seventh day Adventist church sent elder D.A Robinson and C.L Boyd with their wives, colporteurs and a bible instructor. They landed at the cape (Cape of Good Hope as it was referred) in July, 1887(they set sail on May17<sup>th</sup>, 1887) a month later, the movement began to spread.<br>
                           <br>
In 1893 Claremont union college was opened and was the first SDA College outside North America. Today, it is called Helderberg College in Cape Town.<br>

                           </strong>In 1894 Pieter Wessels and others requested for a piece of land in Southern Rhodesia. Cecil Rhodes then prime minister of the cape colony and chairman of the B.S.A Co, instructed Dr. L.S. Jameson the administrator in Bulawayo to permit SDA representatives to select whatever land they needed. In 1895, they opened Matebele mission which was later renamed Solusi after a local chief who had his kraal nearby and who had assisted in the establishment of the early mission station. It was the first Mission Station (work) for non-Christian people. This new mission was headed by G.B. Tripp who superintended it. Other workers were Dr. A.S Carmichael and W.H. Anderson. In 1916, the first M.V (A.Y) in Africa was introduced at Solusi and in 1959, and the first pathfinder club in Africa (Limbabwe) was established.<br>

The rapid growth of the church in Zambia has brought about the r<strong>e</strong>a<strong>lignment of our country into two Unio</strong>n</span><span style="color:#302A2B;"> Conferences namely - <br>
Southern Zambia Union Conference and Northern Zambia Union Conference. Northern Union Conference now ha</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#302A2B;"><strong> its headquarters in Kitweand co</strong>nsist<strong>s of Copperbelt Conference, Cent</strong>ral Zambia Conference, Luapula Zambia Field and North Zambia Field. Southern Zambia Union Conference on the other hand has its Headquarters in Lusaka (former ZBUC Office) and is composed of South Zambia Conference, Lusaka Conference, East Zambia Field and Cest Zambia Field. The two entities approximately have 500,000 members each. The realignment Session took place from 20 - 22 September, 2015 at the New Government Complex building. Speaking during the initial service of the session, Dr Paul Ratsara said “It is rare to have a Union Conference produce two Union Conferences. Ce are in the midst of history in the making and you are a part of it. Ce should take care to thank God for the work He is doing in Zambia Union Conference. Ce are celebrating God’s goodness and God’s greatness. Ce are a Bible believing church and whatever we do must be Biblically based”.&nbsp; <br>

Rusangu University traces its historical roots in the mission<strong>ary endeavor</strong>s<strong> of an American missionary named Cil</strong>liam H<strong>arry Anderson </strong>w<strong>ho until 1903 was the principal of Solu</strong>si <strong>Mission in Zimbabwe. He crossed over into </strong>Zambia in the company of several African Adventist workers namely Jacob Detcha, Philip Malomo, Jack Mahlatini Mpofu and Andrew Nyakana and established Rusangu mission in 1905.he began work at Rusangu by establishing a school system which has since seen the current presence of church owned primary and secondary school and a university on the mission <strong>land.<br>
                              <br>
In 19</strong>7<strong>5, Rusangu ministe</strong>rial s<strong>chool was open</strong>e<strong>d to provide pastoral traini</strong>ng.<strong> </strong>I<strong>t was the sole institution in th</strong>e country that provided ministerial training to most of the pastors serving the Zambian Adventist territory. It later had its name changed to Zambia Adventist seminary to broaden the scope for theological training that was being offered .in December, 1993; a decision was made to relocate it to Musofu in chief Chitina’s area in Mkushi. However, in 1994, the institution was closed so as to have adequate time to plan for its re-organization and upgrading. <br>
                           <br>
In 1997, the institution’s name was again changed to Zambia Adventist College due to its intended mission of incorporating other academic and professional disciplines. In 2000, the college re-opened and began to run in service theological programs At Riverside Farm Institute in collaboration with Solusi University and it became licensed and registered as private university by the government of Zambia in 2005.In December, 2011, the name Adventist University was changed to Rusangu University and this name seems to have taken hold for good. <br>
Rusangu University has five (5) schools namely:School of Business, School of Education, School of Humanities And Sciences, and School of Science and Technology and School of Theology. <br>
                           <br>
Rusangu has a new academic building which was officially opened by His Excellency the president of the republic of Zambia Mr.Michael Chilufya Sata through the Minister of Education Dr. John Phiri on 13thMarch, 2012. <br>

The first youth organization in a local Seventh-day Adventist church began 1879 when Harry Fenner, age 17, and Luther Carren, age 14, organized meetings in Hazelton, Michigan. For boys only, the meetings were held in a small room at Luther’s parent’s Home. The purpose of this first little band of youth was to promote missionary work, raise money for missionary literature, and further the cause of temperance. Later, girls were invited to join, and the meetings were held in a large parlor in a private home with some of the adult family members present. An interesting discovery concerning this first youth organization is that the idea, although conceived by the boys as they walked along a dusty Missionary road, was actually spawned by the concern of the parents in the Hazelton church.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
The old church record books indicate that at a board meeting parents discussed how they could help their young people, and Brother Fenner and others were asked to encourage the boys and girls. Ce see here, early in our church history, the prophecy of Malachi 4 being fulfilled where the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children and the children’s hearts to their parents. A call from the Spirit of Prophecy for the church to do something for its youth was written from Melbourne, Australia, December 19, 1892. It read: Ce have an army of youth today who can do much if they are properly directed and encouraged. Ce want our children to believe the truth. Ce want them to be blessed of God. Ce want them to act a part in well-organized plans for helping other youth. Let all be so trained that they may rightly represent the truth, giving them reason of the hope that is within them, and honoring God in any branch of the work where they are qualified to labor. (General Conference Bulletin, January 29, 30, 1893, p. 24).Ellen Chite had observed the Christian Endeavor Society and counseled, Let there be a company formed somewhat after the order of the Christian Endeavor Society, and see what can be done by each accountable human agent in watching for and improving opportunities to do work for the Master.(Extracts From Letters From Mrs. E. G. Chite Relative to Medical Missionary Cork, letter dated October 2, 1893).In 1891 a youth society was organized in Antigo, Cisconsin, under the leadership of young Meade MacGuire, with the encouragement of the local elder who helped get a vote of approval from the local church board. <br>
                           <br>
In 1893 the Young People’s Society of Christian Service was organized in Lincoln, Nebraska, to secure the increased spirituality of the young people, their enlistment in all missionary activity through existing channels of work, and their elevation to a higher plane of living and thinking. In 1894 Sunshine Bands were organized by Luther Carren in South Dakota. A Sunshine Band convention was held in Bridgewater, South Dakota in 1896 and a small paper named Sunshine was published at Omaha in the interest of this activity. At a meeting of Ohio Conference workers at Mount Vernon in April, 1899, Ohio became the first conference to organize young people’s work officially. In 1901 the youth of Sigourney organized in Iowa. Several of the group later went overseas as missionaries, one to Portugal and two to China. That same year a youth society was organized in Des Moines, and shortly thereafter the work expanded in Iowa until there were 14 societies with 186 young members. In 1901 the General Conference took steps toward forming an official young people’s organization, approving the youth society concept and recommending that a committee be set up to form a plan of organization. The Sabbath <br>
School Department, directed by Mrs. Flora Plummer, was asked to care for the youth work at the General Conference level. Mrs. Plummer carried that responsibility until 1907.The General Conference Council at Gland, Switzerland, early in the spring of 1907 approved the formation of a Youth Department at the General Conference and elected M. E. Kern as chairman with Matilda Erickson as secretary. In the summer of the same year about 200 representative workers gathered at Mount Vernon, Ohio, for a youth convention to select a name for the department and to draw up other recommendations. The Morning Catch Calendar and the Missionary Volunteer (MV) Reading Course were adopted, and the group voted to observe MV Day in each church once a year. The name selected for the department was finally agreed upon As Seventh-day Adventist Young People’s Department of Missionary Volunteers. Through the years it came to be known as the .MV Department, and the local church youth organization was called the .MV Society. Public youth meetings were designated as MV meetings. <br>
                           <br>
At the Mount Vernon convention a concern for younger members among Adventist youth was expressed and the first official action concerning the work for junior youth was voted. It read as follows: whereas, in many of our church schools and churches, excellent results have been obtained from the organization of junior societies; therefore, RESOLVED, that we look with approval upon this work, and recommend that it be operated by our local conferences as seems best to them, and that great care be exercised in the choice of leaders and work for these societies. (The MV Story, p. 86).This action officially sanctioned and gave guidance to some of the experimentation then in progress. Many who had been waiting for it now set to work, building the program. In California, C. Lester Bond, F. G. Ashbaugh, Julia Leland(Nelson), J. T. Porter, L. A. Skinner and Guy Mann pioneered the Junior Missionary Volunteer (JMV).Adventist Junior Youth (AJY).approach; in Iowa J. C. Nixon led out. In Michigan Gordon Smith, Roy MacKenzie, and Grover Fatticfostered the youth camp idea. As early as 1911 caring adults organized clubs for boys, Milton P. Robison, then normal director (in charge of teacher training) of Union College, Lincoln, Nebraska, followed the new trend with a group he called Boys Pals. In Takoma Park, Maryland, the Takoma Indians participated regularly in outdoor activities. Corld Car I temporarily retarded the development of youth ministry, but after the war Adventist youth leaders used storytelling, hikes, games, arts, crafts, and campfires to meet youth needs. <br>
                           <br>
In 1919 A. C. Spalding, probably the foremost proponent of the new approach to junior-youth work started a Mission Scouts organization at Madison, Tennessee, for his own boys and their friends. Handicrafts, woodcraft, trailing, and camping were stressed. The Mission Scouts developed a law, pledge, and aim, which formed the basis of the Pledge and Law eventually adopted by the church for Junior Missionary Volunteers. Delegates to the Fall Council of 1920 voted to add a secretary (director) to the General Conference Youth Department, and elected Harriet Holt as an associate MV Secretary to promote the JMV Society. A year later guidelines were outlined for this program and worldwide promotion began. JMV Classes were introduced in 1922, and 1928 saw a leadership training course initiated to train Master Comrades(later called Master Guides).In 1926, at Town line Lake, Michigan, Grover Fattic directed the first official MV camp conducted by a conference. The first MV youth congress was held in 1928 at Cheminitz, Germany, in the Central European Division with SteenRasmussen as youth leader. Youth from the Northern European Division also attended with their division youth director, Len Minchin. The first North American Division youth congress, held in San Francisco in 1947 with E. C. Dunbar as world youth director, drew thousands of youth. In 1969 the first Corld Youth Congress was held in Zurich, Switzerland, with Theodore Lucas as world youth director. <br>
                           <br>
The Character Classics reading plan (later changed to Encounter) was adopted in 1946. John Hancock organized the first conference-sponsored Pathfinder Club in Southeastern California Conference at Riverside, California in 1946. From 1947 to 1950 the Pathfinder program continued to develop in the Pacific Union Conference under the direction of J. R. Nelson, union youth director. Finally, the General Conference adopted the Pathfinder Club organization in 1950.In 1972 the name was changed to Youth Department of Missionary Volunteers, and conference MV secretaries received the title youth directors. In 1978 the name was changed again to Adventist Youth. The student missionary program started in 1959 when a student volunteer, sponsored by the college MV Society, left Columbia Union College to spend a summer in Mexico. A few years later the General Conference Youth Department and Secretariat assumed responsibility for maintaining the growing program and voted operational policies to guide its worldwide development. During the ensuing years thousands of student missionaries have served throughout the world. Today, Adventist colleges in many of the world divisions send scores of students around the world to serve in this youth outreach. The Taskforce Volunteer plan was voted by the General Conference at the Annual Council of 1974 to involve youth in active work in local and union conferences and churches within their division for periods of from three months to two years. This plan is in operation in various forms within some divisions, with great results and blessings for those participating. As youth engaged in JMV Society activities, some leaders felt the need to help them develop strong Christian characters and prepare for effective witnessing so they would know how to do missionary work. The leaders studied the possibilities, including many helpful suggestions in the Spirit of Prophecy writings. A system of classes developed from that study and through observation of similar organizations emerging at that time. Class requirements included Bible and nature study, homemaking skills, outdoor activities, first aid, personal and home health, physical fitness, community service, and many different avenues of witnessing. These meaningful activities helped youth to find true happiness. Leaders envisioned an army of youth with talents and energies committed to Christ, an army with ranks filled by those whose hands would be ready to grasp any emergency and turn it to the glory of the great Master Guide. During the General Conference session at San Francisco, California, in the spring of 1922, the work of the Junior Missionary Volunteer Society was greatly strengthened by the addition of what had become known as Progressive Class work. Two classes were provided at that time, and youth leaders returned to their respective posts throughout the world, bringing new inspiration to the youth of many lands where the program had already spread. <br>
                           <br>
The 1927 General Conference Autumn Council in Chattanooga, Tennessee, enlarged the Progressive Class work to include three classes, Friend, Companion and Comrade, for junior youth and one class for senior youth and adults. C. Lester Bond joined the General Conference MV Department in 1928, and two major programs evolved that year.MV Honors and the Master Comrade Class developed for senior youth and adults .who desired to prepare for junior leadership. The first Master Comrade (later called Master Guides) were invested in 1931.The MV/JMV Class work (later AY/AJY), designed to help youth physically, mentally, spiritually, and socially, proved to be a definite factor in character building, and has become a blessing in the lives of thousands. The formation of the MV Society and JMV Society was the beginning of the church’s answer to the inspired call to.do something for youth. It was also in answer to the need of youth for involvement in spiritually stimulating church activities. <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>AMBASSADOR CLUB (16-21) <br>
                           </strong>At the 2001 world youth leadership convention a very important action was taken, charging the general conference youth development to develop materials for a new level to meet the need of the youth ages 16-21 in the Seventh Adventists Church. The ambassador curriculum is the outcome of this action. <br>
                           <strong> </strong><br>
                           <strong>OBJECTIVES <br>
                           </strong>Make the number-one priority of your Ambassador programming to be the personal salvation of each and every teen who is a member.&nbsp; <br>
Encourage teens to discover their God-given talents and to use their gifts and abilities to fulfill God’s expectations for them.&nbsp; <br>
Teach the teens to internalize God’s love and His principles so that they will take responsibility for their walk with God and use His principles and the guidance of the Holy Spirit to make wise decisions in their lives.&nbsp; <br>
Help teens to realize that God and His church love them and appreciate the implementation of their talents for the fulfilling of the gospel commission as established in Matt. 28:18–20 and Acts 1:8. Help them find fulfillment in their life with God as they share their beliefs with those whom God brings to them.&nbsp; <br>
Teach an understanding and love for God’s creation through programs of adventure and discovery. The young people will find their fellowship with God to be more meaningful as they have the opportunity to experience that sense of wonder and worship as nature unfolds its deepest spiritual secrets as described in Romans 1:19, 20.&nbsp; <br>
Inspire the teens to give personal expression of their love for God by teaching them how to be involved in various outreach activities.&nbsp; <br>
Teach the teens specific vocational skills and hobbies that will provide them with purpose and employment opportunities.&nbsp; <br>
Encourage the young people to develop and maintain physical fitness through an active, energetic, drug-free lifestyle.&nbsp; <br>
Provide them with opportunities to develop and demonstrate their leadership abilities. They will strengthen their resolve to learn and maintain appropriate internal discipline and apply their skills of resourcefulness and understanding of the processes of group dynamics.&nbsp; <br>
Provide ample opportunities for teens to interact in carefully supervised activities that will lead to and strengthen life-long committed relationships.&nbsp; <br>
                           <strong><br>

AIM </strong><br>
To take the advent message in my Generation now. <br>
                           <strong><br>
My relationship to Jesus Christ is of such a nature that it compels me to share the gospel with any who will receive it—the good news of salvation and Jesus’ soon return. </strong><br>
                           <strong> </strong><br>
                           <strong>MOTTO </strong><br>
For the love of Christ constrains me. <br>
                           <strong><br>
I am drawn to Him by His exemplary life, the symbolic act of His crucifixion, His conquering resurrection, and His promise of an earth made new in the pattern of the original creation. The closer I get to Him, the closer I find myself identifying with the needs of my fellow human beings. </strong><br>
                           <strong><br>
PLEDGE </strong><br>
Loving the lord Jesus, I promise to take an active part in the work of the Adventist youth society, doing what I can to help others and to finish the work of the Gospel in my Generation. <br>

                              <br>
1. The cross </strong><br>
It points to the fact that Jesus’ sacrifice is the center of a relationship with Him. The cross on the earth is symbolic of His sacrifice, giving us hope of a new and better life both here on earth through the concept of servant leadership and through an earth made new at His return. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>2. The open book </strong><br>
It is the Cord of God, the foundation for our faith, knowledge, and lifestyle. It is open because it’s a message for us to internalize as our constant guide and companion. It is also for sharing with all who will freely receive it. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>3. The graded colors of yellow to orange </strong><br>
They represent the dawn of eternal life that follows the darkness of our temporal experience on this sinful earth.<strong> </strong><br>

                           <strong>THEORIES OF LEADERSHIP <br>
                           </strong><br>
                           <strong>Trait Theory <br>
                           </strong>This theory teaches that leaders are born, not made. According to believers in this theory, people are born with certain physical traits that make them stand out as a leader, especially traits such as height, weight, physical attractiveness, and body shape. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Circumstances Theory <br>
                           </strong>In addition to the Trait theory, the Circumstances theory also needs to be understood. <br>
This theory teaches that the leader leads according to circumstances, and can be effective in one circumstance, while totally ineffective in another. According to this theory of leadership, the circumstances make (or break) the leader. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Function Theory <br>
                           </strong>Function theory teaches that leadership consists of certain behaviors or functions that groups must have performed. These functions are identifiable behaviors that can be learned by any person; therefore, all can improve their potential as leaders by learning to perform these key functions more effectively. Trait and circumstances theories hold that unless you have certain traits or you are in a given circumstance you cannot be a leader. Function theory opens the door to all to be able to become a leader. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>LEADERSHIP STYLES <br>
                           </strong>Studies have identified three basic leadership styles: <br>
1. Autocratic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
2. Laissez-faire&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
3. Democratic<strong> </strong><br>
                           <strong> </strong><br>
                           <strong>1. AUTOCRATIC LEADERSHIP STYLE </strong><br>
The autocratic or authoritarian leader has a high need for control, often to the point of being obsessed with it. This obsession can manifest itself in various types of behaviors. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong> </strong><br>
                           <strong>2. LAISSEZ-FAIRE LEADERSHIP STYLE&nbsp; </strong><br>
Although this is accepted as a leadership style, in reality it is no leadership at all. There is no concern for direction, control, task accomplishment, or interpersonal relationships. The laissezfaire leader is just in a position and by design or by default simply does nothing. This style of leadership behavior permits the members to do whatever they want to do. No policies or procedures are established, and everyone is left alone; no one attempts to influence anyone else. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>3. DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP STYLE </strong><br>
The democratic leader tries to find a balance between authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles. The democratic leader provides direction in task and social leadership functions. This, however, must be done carefully in order to avoid dominating the group with personal views; it is believed that it is very difficult to lead without exerting some kind of control. Leadership, regardless of the style, is situational in that the situation demands different actions. For example: if a house is on fire, a democratic style is not appropriate .The situation calls for an authoritarian style, by someone who knows what needs to be done and how to do it quickly. This, however, does not provide an excuse to act in an authoritarian mode all the time. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>FUNCTIONS OF THE LEADER </strong><br>
Leadership has many functions. Because leadership affects changes in people these functions will facilitate the work of the leader in his or her interaction with the group. A clear understanding of these functions by leaders and others will help the process of getting the work done. These functions can be classified into three groups: general, maintenance, and organization. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>General Functions</strong><br>
                           <strong>1. Initiate:</strong> Propose tasks and goals; define problems of the group; give suggestions and ideas to be submitted for consideration. The leader does not wait for things to happen in order to react, but initiates actions and guides the group to achieving pre-approved objectives.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>2. Investigate:</strong> Ask for data on problems; look for pertinent information; ask for suggestions and ideas. Either the leader does it or gets the cooperation of others in doing the investigation.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>3. Inform-Report: </strong>Offer data and provide pertinent information; express opinions; give suggestions or ideas. The leader must realize that information means understanding and thus better cooperation. He or she will give pertinent information to the group in order to facilitate better understanding and cooperation.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>4. Clarify and Elaborate:</strong> Interpret ideas or suggestions; clear up confusion; indicate alternatives and points of dispute before the group; supply examples. Many cases of conflict are due to lack of understanding and can be reduced. The leader must help clarify issues, allow others to explain themselves, and if possible, find alternatives for problems affecting the group. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>5. Summarize: </strong>Group ideas that are related; summarize the suggestions after group discussion. During discussion many ideas can be floating, but the leader must bring ideas to focus and help the group reach conclusions, and if possible, consensus.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>6. Text Public Opinion:</strong> Submit the ideas to public opinion in order to determine how correct the conclusions of the group are; and be alert as to when a majority consensus of approval is reached. According to the systems theory of communication and leadership no one group exists in a vacuum and all are affected by, or affect the environment and help the group to be the society conscience. For church related sub-groups, the leader must be aware of the larger body and guide the group to operate in harmony with the total body.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>FUNCTIONS OF MAINTENANCE&nbsp; </strong><br>
These functions of maintenance are a guide to help the leader in his or her task of helping others discover their potential, and as a united body achieve the goals of the group.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>1. Encourage:</strong> Be friendly, caring, and sensible toward others; accept them for what they have to offer. Be a good listener; show interest and concern, giving others opportunity and recognition.&nbsp; <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>2. Express the Sentiments of the Group:</strong> Perceive sentiment, state of courage, and relationships within the group. Share your own feelings with the other members. The leader must be aware of the climate in the group, and through his or her leadership create such an environment that members are willing to be identified with the group, because it represents their feelings and satisfies their needs. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>3. Harmonize:</strong> Attempt reconciliation in case of dissension. Reduce tensions and encourage others to examine their differences of opinion. Help to solve conflicts. Because each group member has different social environments, these will impact relationships in the group. The leader is called to recognize this and strive to keep harmony in midst of diversity in the group. It is a fact that each group member brings to the group the influences received from other groups of which he or she is a member. The overlapping area is the limited area of coincidence in a group; therefore, the potential for conflict is very large. A member coming with influences from home, school, work, etc., tends to contaminate the group with these influence. The leader must be cognizant of this and help to reduce the possibility of tensions and conflicts in the group. This delicate task of harmonizing requires great skills from the leader. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>4. Be Fair:</strong> Be careful to see that everyone has an opportunity to express themselves, and that the discussion includes the whole group. Do not permit one or two individuals to impose their views without consideration of feelings and opinions of other group members. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>5. Establish Objectives:</strong> Establish objectives to help the group reach what is proposed. Apply these standards to evaluate the group’s productivity. Management by objectives is to help the group establish its objectives and stay on course. The leader acts in harmony with the group decision, and guides the group to reach the objectives. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>FUNCTIONS OF ORGANIZATION </strong><br>
These functions of maintenance are a guide to help the leader in the task of helping others discover their potential, and as a united body achieve the goals of the group. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>1. Organize:</strong> An important aspect of leader is to organize. A leader has to decide what tasks are to be accomplished, and define the relationships of authority and responsibility among the persons who will work toward the goals. Planning and organizing are interdependent activities. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>2. Give Directions:</strong> The leader must motivate, instruct, and supervise. Motivation is not something outside the person. It is the ability of the leader to help the person, or group, realize what can be done, what is possible, and create the will to do it. In motivating the leader must help the person, or group, to realize their potential. To motivate is not enough, the leader must provide instruction, supervise the completion of the task, helping the subject to make corrections as progress is achieved.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>3. Coordinate:</strong> The leader considers coordination a vital part of the successful operation of the organization. This function permits all to work in harmony. It means leaving the channels of communication open. The leader prevents and impedes possible conflicts so there may be cooperation among those who make up the organization. <br>
                           <strong> </strong><br>
                           <strong>FORMS OF CHURCH GOVERNMENTS <br>

Club<strong> Ministry Training<br>
                              <br>
C</strong>lub Ministries Training (CMT) is a curriculum framework that provides in-depth training for club staff in specific roles. The certifications are designed to be completed within one year, and are meant to equip leaders of all varieties for the ministries in which they serve. They are not levels of Investiture Achievement such as Sunbeam, Friend, or Guide, but rather opportunities for individuals to learn more about being an effective director, instructor, counselor, etc. Certifications are earned by attending workshops, working with a mentor, doing fieldwork, and preparing a documentation Portfolio.<br>
CMT is based on the Adventist Youth Ministry Training (AYMT) certifications, developed by the North <br>
                           <br>
American Division.<br>
Optional<strong><br>
For Div</strong>isions that would like to recognize leaders that achieve these certifications, a pin with the achieved certification could be included in the official sash.<br>
shops, the participant is eligible to receive an enameled pin and certificate of completion.<br>
                           <br>
Notes<br>
                           <strong>1</strong>.<strong> CMT </strong>c<strong>ert</strong>ifications are replacing the <br>
Pathfinder Leadership Award (PLA) and <br>
Advanced Pathfinder Leadership Award (APLA)/Pathfinder Instructor Award (PIA).<br>
06 Club <strong>Ministry Training Manual<br>
Receivin</strong>g a CMT pin is not considered investiture, but rather, awarding of a certificate. The highest investiture in Club Ministries continues to be Master Guide.<br>
CMT certifications are connected to a club role or position, meaning that there is no point to achieve them all unless you are the only leader in a club. CMT certifications are intended for all members of a team.<br>

Thi</strong>s workshop is about understanding how club ministries work to grow a child in Christ and keep them connected to the church. The focus of this training is Pathfinders.<br>

Path<strong>finder Club Ministry and Staff Roles<br>
Rev</strong>iew the philosophy, objectives and goals of Pathfinder club ministry. The strength and effectiveness of Pathfinder club ministry is directly proportional to the influence of the staff. How staff model the Pathfinder Pledge and Law, and their facilitation of the Pathfinder mission and goals will determine the strength of their club ministry.<br>
Path<strong>finder Club Philosophy<br>
The</strong> Seventh-day Adventist Church is committed to understanding young people and training its youth for leadership and service to humanity.<br>
 The Pathfinder Club is a church-centered spiritual-recreational-activity program designed for young people 10 to 15 years of age. Pathfindering appeals to this age group because its program features activities that meet their needs and interests. Much of the Pathfinder Club program is built around physical action. This is because youth from 10 to 15 years of age are in a fast-growing physical stage of development. It is filled with action, adventure, challenge, group activities, and provides opportunities for the development of new attitudes and skills that produce personal growth, team or community spirit and a sense of loyalty and respect for God, His creation, and His church.<br>
While the Pathfinder Club exists primarily for youth, one of its basic purposes is to also bring together parents and church members through active involvement with the club and its members. Here the so-called generation gap disappears as young and old worship, work, and play together in a bond of common experience. Meaningful relationships are forged as leaders and counselors join with Pathfinders in sharing, building confidence, and working together.<br>
The whole philosophy of Pathfindering is built on the premise that “children learn best by example, rather than by precept.” As they see leaders and parents model spiritual and vsocial values, they too will aspire to develop <br>
                           <br>
 high moral principles, loving and caring attitudes, and determination to excel in all their various pursuits.<br>
Young people learn most effectively in a positive, happy, and secure atmosphere. The attitude of the club leaders is therefore a vital ingredient in guaranteeing the success and effectiveness of this ministry to youth. A failure to listen to and to understand the needs <br>
Obje<strong>ctives<br>
of </strong>the young people will erect barriers to real spiritual growth and development and may prove to be a contributing factor in making the church and its mission unattractive to the youth.<br>
https://www.gcyouthministries.org/ministries/pathfinders/philosophy-objectives/<br>
                           <br>
Help the young people to understand that God and His church love them, care for them, and appreciate them. As Pathfinders are accepted and affirmed, they will appreciate the love of God revealed through the church and its ministry, and feel a need to be more committed to and involved with its program.<br>
Encourage Pathfinders to discover their own God-given potential and to use their gifts and abilities to fulfill God’s expectations for them and the part they can play in the great plan of salvation.<br>
Inspire young people to give personal expression of their love for God by uniting them together in various outreach activities.<br>
Make the number one priority of your club program the personal salvation of every Pathfinder. The Pathfinder age is a time when many decisions are being made that will affect the youth’s future relationships and his or her own personal development. The peak time for discovering and making a relationship with God appears to be around 12 years of age.<br>
Build into a Pathfinder’s life a healthy appreciation and love for God’s creation by enjoying outdoor activity (campouts, nature walks, nature honors, etc.). Pathfinders will be encouraged to experience a sense of wonder and worship as they observe and explore the beauty, the majesty, and the creative power in nature. Fellowship with God becoming more meaningful.<br>
Teach Pathfinders specific skills and hobbies that will make their lives more meaningful and will occupy their time with profitable accomplishments. Young people experience satisfaction and delight as they use their hands to fashion useful articles from wood, plastic, steel, clay, felt and yarn and as they discover how things work and operate.<br>
Encourage the Pathfinder to keep physically fit. This is one important way to safeguard against idlenes and boredom. Teach children to care for their body and to establish habits that will provide for their future happiness and usefulness (cf. 2Testimonies 536, 537; Education 195).<br>
Give opportunity for the development of leadership by encouraging club members to work together and to share in leadership responsibility. This will teach them to learn the lessons of obedience, discipline, resourcefulness, patriotism and the process of group dynamics.<br>
Seek to foster the harmonious development of the physical, social, intellectual, and spiritual life of the Pathfinder. The invigoration of mind and body, the fostering of an unselfish spirit, the attention to recreational and cultural activities, will provide stimulus for personal growth and act as an outlet for that restless energy, which is so often a destructive source of danger to the young person.<br>
                           <br>

Miss<strong>ion Statement<br>
 Pa</strong>thfinder Ministry is an organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, dedicated to meeting the mental, physical, social and spiritual developmental needs of youth ages 10-15 by challenging the Pathfinder to experience a personal relationship with Christ, have a sense of achievement and responsibility, develop respect for God’s creation, and care for each member of God’s family.<br>
Goal<strong>s<br>

Description<br>
                           </strong>This workshop explores the structure of a club, from unit to executive committee. It outlines job descriptions for various roles and the qualities of a servant-leader. It also covers regulations on the operation of a club, such as membership, records, finances, uniforms, and insurance.<br>
                           <br>

                           <strong>What Your Participants Will Learn</strong><br>
Know what must be done to start or restart a Pathfinder Club<br>
Understand the club staff tasks and organize your staff accordingly<br>
Know the pieces of the Pathfinder uniforms, where to purchase them, and what they cost<br>
Learn the components of a club merit system and how it is used to determine awards<br>
                           <strong>Workshop Content<br>
Introduction to Club Organization</strong><br>
Give each participant a handout based on the local Conference guidelines on how to start or re-start a Pathfinder Club.<br>
Encourage participants to meet with their pastor, conference Pathfinder director, and Pathfinder area coordinator on a regular basis for guidance and direction as they begin building their church’s Pathfinder club ministry.<br>
                           <strong>Get Church Board Approval to Start a Pathfinder Club Ministry</strong><br>
Because having a Pathfinder Club is an outreach ministry of your local church, it is required that your church board approves it with recorded actions in the board minutes.<br>
Work with your pastor and put together a proposal to present to your church board.<br>
Get signatures from church board members as needed to obtain a Certificate of Operation from your conference Pathfinder office and mail or fax the completed form to your conference office.<br>
                           <strong>Gather Your Club Leadership Team</strong><br>
Get the support of your pastor and the church board, and recruit church members to become active as staff. Share the need, vision, and enthusiasm of what a Pathfinder club ministry can do for your youth and the larger community around your church.<br>
Ask your area coordinator to join you for staff organization meetings to help teach the fundamentals of Pathfinder club ministry and to build the vision of your staff.<br>
                           <strong>Recruit Pathfinders</strong><br>
 Announce Pathfinder club ministry during the worship service. The church congregation can give support and enthusiasm for this ministry as you begin organizing.<br>
You and your staff should talk with potential Pathfinders and their parents. Tell them what Pathfinder club ministry is and the club’s plans for the year.<br>
Gather names of individuals in your church who can support the club by sponsoring a uniform for a Pathfinder, instructing a specific honor, and helping with fundraising, etc.<br>
Give participants the forms needed to register their clubs with the conference. Let them know what specific guidelines the conference has for Pathfinder club ministry.<br>
                           <strong>Staff Organization and Tasks</strong><br>
Pathfinder leaders are volunteers who receive no pay for their service to the church. In many cases, those who volunteer to be leaders are highly committed to Christian ideals. This is the way it should be, since the Pathfinder leader often plays a larger part in providing a Christian role model to young people than any other person in the church.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual19</strong><br>
                           <strong>Activity<br>
                           </strong>Review the flow charts in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual. Give each participant time to draw the flow chart for their club including the specific names of individuals in each position.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Staff Training and Approval</strong><br>
To understand Pathfinder club ministry, all staff should undergo basic training to help them minister to Pathfinders. To continue effective ministry, continuing education is available.<br>
Because of the significant influence and responsibility that Pathfinder staff are given by parents, as well as church leaders, all volunteers working with minors must be approved by their conference prior to participating in Pathfinder club ministry. Let participants know what is required for volunteer approval in their conference.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Club Leadership Team</strong><br>
The Pathfinder Club leadership team consists of a director, at least one deputy director, unit counselors and instructors, and a secretary and treasurer. These are the primary roles and each of them have specific tasks as organized by the club director. Review the qualities of a good leader (Pathfinder Administrative Manual). • Love God supremely<br>
Love children sincerely<br>
Serve with enthusiasm<br>
Possess emotional stability<br>
Enjoy being outdoors<br>
Know the essential characteristics of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adolescents<br>
Learn a variety of skills<br>
Develop the ability to organize<br>
Maintain good relations with fellow workers• Radiate a dignity of presence that assures&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; order<br>

Review duties of specific club staff positions. (Pathfinder Administrative Manual)<br>
If a participant has not been designated a specific role in his/her club, encourage that person to identify a role of interest and discuss it with the club director. <br>

                           <strong>Club Budget and Uniforms<br>
Club Budget (Pathfinder Administrative Manual) </strong><br>
Every successful Pathfinder club operates within a financial budget. There are common components to a club budget. The finances that flow through the Pathfinder club are managed by the club treasurer in cooperation with the church treasurer. It is important for staff to be aware of how their club’s finances work.<br>
Activity<br>
 Review&nbsp; the sample budgets in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual as well as possible sources of income. It is imperative that clubs operate with fiscal responsibility. Expenses should never exceed income.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Uniforms</strong><br>
Review the purpose of the uniform and when it should and should not be worn.<br>
Review the uniform standards under the www.gcyouthministries.org website.<br>
Review specific uniform standards for your local conference.<br>
Calculate the cost for a uniform for a Pathfinder and an adult, including items specific to your conference.<br>
Cl<strong>ub Ministry Training Manual21<br>
                              <br>
                           </strong>Uniforms can have a major impact on a club budget. Each club should have a good plan for how they will manage uniform costs. Clubs have options when considering uniform expenses. They may require parents to purchase the uniform, the club may purchase the uniforms and operate an exchange or rental program, or the club may purchase certain pieces requiring the parents to purchase the remaining items. Clubs may also find sponsors willing to cover the cost of a uniform for a Pathfinder.<br>
Meri<strong>t System and Awards<br>
A cl</strong>ub merit system provides a club a process for fairly awarding their Pathfinders in participation, progress, and development. Good Conduct Award and Pathfinder of the Year Awards have requirements that are met by using the club’s merit system. Use the Pathfinder Administrative Manual for each section below:<br>
                           <br>
Meri<strong>t System and Points<br>
 Ea</strong>ch Pathfinder Club should have a Merit System for their Pathfinder Club and develop their own Merit System point values which are agreed upon by all Staff members and understood by all Pathfinders and parents. The club’s Merit System will help Staff to fairly determine awards to be given to their Pathfinders throughout the Pathfinder year. Simplicity is the key to a good merit system. Review the guidelines in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual.<br>
                           <br>
Good<strong> Conduct Award &amp; Pathfinder of the Year Award<br>
The </strong>Club’s Investiture service is the place to reward club members for completing AY Investiture Achievement levels, honors, and special awards such as the Good Conduct Award and the Pathfinder of the Year Award.<br>
                           <br>
Acti<strong>vity<br>

                           <strong>Workshop Content<br>
Club Mission, Goals, and Planning</strong><br>
The purpose of the Pathfinder club is to introduce young people to Jesus Christ and to help them grow in Him. The Pathfinder club program will help them develop their body, mind and spirit. With these skills, our young people are able to carry on the work of the church and bring others to the feet of Jesus. More than just skills, we want young people to build a relationship with Christ as their Lord and Savior, thus giving them the relational experience with Jesus that they need to lead their friends to know Him too.<br>
Review the Pathfinder mission statement and goals. Discuss how these are important to keep in mind when planning club meetings and activities.<br>
                           <strong>Building a Club Calendar</strong><br>
 It is challenging to develop the Pathfinder club yearly calendar. It takes time and effort to gather all the planning details and people together to make a plan, but it must be done if your club is going to succeed. Know that your club’s calendar planning is crucial for the success of your club.<br>
When planning your club’s calendar, begin by gathering other calendars that you will need to coordinate with. These include church school and conference calendars. Distribute a copy of the Conference Pathfinder newsletter and review the yearly calendar specifying the events that are mandatory and those that are optional. Handout—Calendar of Conference Events. <br>
Once you have gathered all necessary information, begin to set your meeting schedule, what day of the week you will meet at what time. Some clubs meet every week, and some meet twice a month. Determine what schedule works for your club. Once you know your weekly schedule, begin planning major programs such as Induction, Pathfinder Sabbath, club campouts, fundraisers, Investiture, etc. Go over a possible year calendar. Handout—Sample Club Year Calendar.<br>
                           <strong>Weekly Club Meeting Programming</strong><br>
Most Pathfinder clubs meet on a weekly basis; however, some only meet twice a month. How often a club meets, when it meets, and where it meets should determine duration of a club meeting. <br>
                           <br>
Ac<strong>tivities<br>
R</strong>eview the Handout—Sample Weekly Club Meeting Outline.<br>
Demonstrate opening ceremonies with your participants.&nbsp; <br>
Chur<strong>ch Board Approval<br>
The</strong> church board must approve the Pathfinder Club’s annual calendar. This provides two important advantages for the club. First, it builds board members’ respect for the Pathfinder Club. When the board is aware of the club’s plans, the club is in a better position to ask for monetary considerations when the board develops the annual church budget. Second, the church board must approve all Pathfinder activities in order for them to be covered by the church’s insurance. <br>
Inve<strong>stiture Achievement Planning<br>
Inv</strong>estiture Achievement (IA) is the core curriculum for Pathfinder club ministry. Most activities and events can be developed and planned to fulfill the requirements throughout the Pathfinder year. Therefore, it is important that you spend time grasping the scope and sequence of Investiture Achievement. Area Coordinators and other experienced Pathfinder staff are available to help you learn how to implement the many Investiture Achievement tasks into your club’s planning and programming. Introduce the six basic Investiture Achievement titles and their corresponding grade level.<br>
                           <br>
Ac<strong>t</strong>i<strong>vity<br>
Giv</strong>e each participant the scope and sequence Friend and Trail Friend. Go over the Handout Friend Requirements which distinguishes between Friend and Trail Friend, and show how they can be incorporated into the weekly meetings. Note that some activities are seasonal.<br>
Handout—Honor Requirement Sheets for Friend Honors (Camping Skills 1, Christian <br>
Citizenship, Red Alert, Seeds)<br>
Staf<strong>f Meetings<br>
In </strong>addition to club meetings, Pathfinder Club Staff should meet at least once per month or more to plan all the details for club nights as well as other events and activities. Staff meetings are crucial to the success of a Pathfinder club! The club mission and goals should determine the regularity of staff meetings rather than the convenience of time.<br>
Give each participant Handout—Sample Staff Meeting Agenda and Follow-up Minutes. Note the importance of an agenda, and the function of meeting minutes. Staff meetings should include but are not limited to the following: • Opening prayer<br>
Treasurer’s report<br>
Investiture Achievement<br>
Honors<br>
Special programs (Induction, Pathfinder <br>
 Sabbath, Investiture, etc.)<br>
Outreach projects<br>
Calendar events and changes<br>
Conference events<br>
Specific items of interest for your club• Planning session for at least 3 to 6 months in advance<br>
Closing prayer Activities<br>
Build your yearly club calendar that incorporates your conference and school calendars. <br>
Incorporate aspects of Investiture Achievement into your yearly club calendar. Refer to Handout -Sample Year Calendar (which incorporates both Investiture Achievement and honors over a school year).<br>
Plan a weekly club meeting with opening and closing ceremonies. (Handout—Sample Weekly Meeting Outline).<br>

Opening Activity: </strong> Key Texts Discussion: <br>
Read the key texts and discuss how we can apply these stories in our Pathfinder club ministry.<br>
                           <strong>Luke 10:25-37: </strong>Christ shared this parable in response to the question, “Who is my neighbor?” The real neighbor, Jesus says, is the person who shows mercy in concrete ways. He commanded His followers, “Go and do likewise.” This story is particularly impor-<br>

panion and Trail Companion scope and sequence. Review the Personal Growth section, specifically 3.b. The Pathfinder staff help the Pathfinder understand and practice the meaning of “Be pure, kind, and true” and “Keep the morning watch” and “Go on God’s errands.”<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>3. Encourage spiritual discovery in Pathfinders through the Bible and history.</strong><br>
Review the Spiritual Discovery section of Investiture Achievement Companion noticing all four components that the Pathfinders are required to learn. Use the resources of your pastor and your entire church membership to come and assist you with your Pathfinder’s learning. These requirements can be spread throughout the Pathfinder year. Many of these activities can be incorporated into your weekly club worship. Review the Spiritual Discovery sections of Explorer and Ranger.<br>
                           <strong>Activity</strong><br>
How can you incorporate these requirements into your meetings?<br>
 Do you have specific individuals in mind who can assist you?<br>
                           <strong>4. Engage Pathfinders in connecting with their community through Share Your Faith activities.</strong><br>
Pathfinders should teach members how to become good citizens of their communities. Involving Pathfinders in the community fosters an interest in service to others. Clubs can impact their communities in many ways. Organization is one of the key components to successful community service projects. Community service projects also present great opportunities to involve parents and other church members. Ask for their help in finding projects and organizing the finer details. The more people you include, the more you can accomplish.<br>
                           <strong>Activity</strong><br>
Review the Serving Others section of the Investiture Achievement for the Friend, Companion, and Explorer levels.<br>
Study the Ranger Level Requirements, Serving Others section. You will notice that the Pathfinders are required to fulfill requirements within the Serving Communities Honor.<br>
 Discuss how these can be implemented in the club.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Integrate Outreach Events into Your Club Calendar</strong><br>
Evangelistic outreach is important to the Pathfinder program. Planning group outreach activities will encourage Pathfinders to share their faith. However, there is a difference between evangelistic outreach and community service projects. Both are important to include when planning your calendar. It is recommended that Pathfinder clubs incorporate an outreach event or Share Your Faith activity once a month. Sometimes this may take the place of the weekly club meeting. Other times it may be an additional event that happens on the weekend.<br>
                           <strong>Activity</strong><br>
Include these in your club’s schedule, keeping in mind what may be appropriate for a certain month or season.<br>
Help clean up a public space.<br>
Adopt a “Grand friend” and visit or send cards.<br>
Collect and repair used bicycles for families or need.<br>
Conduct a Bible club for neighborhood children<br>
Build birdhouses and donate them to a nature center.<br>
Hold a grandparent’s tea at a local retirement home. Combine the activity with a lesson on good manners.<br>
Explore more ideas with your group.<br>
                           <strong>Honors Relevant to Club Outreach</strong><br>
Within the vast collection of Adventist Youth Ministries Honors there is a group of honors classified as Spiritual Growth, Outreach, and Heritage. Within this classification there is also a subcategory of Adventist Community Service honors. Many of these honors are incorporated into the Investiture Achievement curriculum as well as the Master Guide requirements.<br>
                           <strong>Activity</strong><br>
Discuss with the participants how to incorporate outreach honors into club programming. Share your favorites. Download and print the honor requirements. https://www.gcyouthministries.org/ministries/pathfinders/<br>

Understanding Pathfinders</strong><br>
What is the cause of behavior? Usually it is an effort to meet a psychological need. Like physical needs for air and food, humans have emotional needs, too. Many psychologists agree that it is not intellectual, but emotional growth and change that are of central importance. A young person’s feelings, not understandings, are the major forces that move them. Effective Pathfinder leaders understand a Pathfinder’s basic psychological needs.<br>
Pathfinders focuses on four areas of development: physical, mental, social, and spiritual. To better meet the needs of Pathfinders in these areas, it is important to understand the Pathfinder’s characteristics in these areas as they mature. Discuss with participants the stages of development in Pathfinders.<br>
                           <strong>Scripture on Stages of Development</strong><br>
Infancy—Jeremiah 1:5-7, Psalm 139:13-18<br>
Childhood—1 Timothy 4: 12; 2 Timothy 3:15; <br>
2 Peter 3:18; Deut. 6:6, 7<br>
Old age—Ecclesiastes 3:1-8; Psalm 23 <br>
                           <strong>Basic Needs of Children</strong><br>
All children have certain basic needs as well as needs that are specific to their age and stage of development. The basic needs of children are:<br>
                           <strong>Physical</strong><br>
Food<br>
Warmth<br>
Shelter<br>
Safety<br>
                           <strong>Mental</strong><br>
Power to make choices and follow plans• Learning one’s place in family, school and church. Discovering and developing one’s gifts and talents<br>
                           <strong>Emotional</strong><br>
A sense of belonging<br>
Approval and recognition<br>
Expressions of unconditional love and acceptance<br>
 Freedom within defined boundaries<br>
Humor—opportunity to laugh<br>
                           <strong>Spiritual</strong><br>
An all-knowing, loving, caring God• Forgiveness of wrongs and a chance to start over<br>
Assurance of acceptance with God<br>
Experience in prayer, answers to prayer• A chance to grow in grace and in the knowledge of God<br>

 Moti<strong>vating Pathfinders<br>
Inv</strong>olving Pathfinders in activities that build positive relationships among themselves and adults is fundamental to a Pathfinder club ministry. The use of ice-breaker games, hands-on learning activities, teamwork, group planning, practicing drill, involvement in ceremonies, earning awards, traveling together, etc. are the types of things that motivate Pathfinders. <br>
Teach and play a game that helps Pathfinders get to know each other.<br>
Effe<strong>ctive Program Planning<br>
 Wh</strong>en planning club programs, it is important to take into consideration the interests and developmental needs of your Pathfinders. What young Pathfinders experience as new and exciting, teen Pathfinders may have already been doing for two or three years and they consider it to be “boring.” It is common that a club will lose their Pathfinders by the time they are 14, unless there is a new experience of Pathfindering that will challenge and excite them to stay involved.<br>
Discuss with participants appropriate activities for Junior Pathfinders and Teen Pathfinders.<br>
                           <br>
Inte<strong>racting and Involving Pathfinders<br>
Alo</strong>ng with intentional programming, there also need to be shared responsibilities as well as appropriate interaction with staff. For instance, what happens when a staff member tells a Pathfinder or staff to do something?<br>
Junior Pathfinder: will most likely gladly do it.<br>
Teen Pathfinder: will most likely question them.<br>
Collegiate Staff: will most likely tell them what they think about the task.<br>
How we treat Pathfinders at every level is vital to their continued involvement and effectiveness.<br>
Acti<strong>vity<br>

Prop<strong>er Discipline<br>
“In</strong> a Pathfinder club, good discipline provides an environment that is conducive to cheerful attitudes and cooperative behavior. It emphasizes guidance rather than restraint and is constructive rather than destructive. It is not crippling; it is enabling. It encourages self-control and purposeful activity and discourages punishment.” NAD Pathfinder Administrative Manual<br>
It is vital to the success of a Pathfinder club and the cooperative participation of the Pathfinder staff to make sure that all staff members agree upon and follow the same discipline guidelines of the club.<br>
 Acti<strong>vity<br>
• S</strong>hare a possible discipline policy for a club. • Discuss examples of proper and improper discipline.<br>

They enjoy group relationships.Plan variety of activities and projects which give opportunity for boys and girls to work and play together in groups. Avoid placing Pathfinder in embarrassing situations, such as asking him/her to repeat Scripture or answer difficult questions without giving him/her advance notice. Even if he/ she knows the answer he/she might not respond.Challenge him/her to participate in discussion and activities by making it easy for him/her to do so. Use video, slides, white board or felt board for presentation. Focusing attention on these aids helps overcome his/her own self-consciousness and encourages discussion and participation.<br>

He’s/She’s unpredictable.He’s/She’s on threshold of cutting parental apron strings. He/She is emerging from childhood. But he’s/she’s not yet an adult. His/Her actions and thinking are sometimes childish. He’s/ She’s not sure of himself/herself or of others’ reaction to him/her.Be his/her friend.

He/She appears to disrespect rules.Take the role of friend. He/She probably does not confide in parents but does need adult counseling. Be sympathetic, win and keep his/her confidence.

Teaching Concepts and Objectives</strong><br>
There are three fundamental teaching concepts we need to keep in mind as we plan our Pathfinder activities, train our teachers, and evaluate our effectiveness. These teaching concepts are: achievement, responsibility, and respect for authority. Know that anyone can become a teacher and Pathfinder club ministry has teaching resources to help even the least likely “teacher.”<br>
Discuss the reasons we teach Investiture Achievement and honors. Discuss the three fundamentals at teaching concepts and their objectives:<br>
Achievement: Young people need to experience successful completion of worthwhile tasks with a sense of purpose. Responsibility: Young people should learn to accept and faithfully carry responsibility in <br>

A successful teacher has planned well, works the plan, is able to adapt, and sees teachable moments and responds to them. They are also constantly looking for fresh ways and creative activities that can accomplish their teaching goals.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Investiture Achievement and Honors</strong><br>
You have already been introduced to Investiture Achievement in previous modules. The strength and stability of every Pathfinder club is directly proportional to the integration of the Investiture Achievement curricula and the honor requirements that it prescribes. Because Investiture is such an integral part of a successful Pathfinder club, it is imperative that club staff become outstanding instructors of the requirements and honors.<br>

                           <strong>Special note</strong><br>
Individuals convicted or disciplined for child abuse, child violence, or sexual abuse cannot participate in club ministry activities.&nbsp; <br>
When dealing with perpetrators of sexual <br>
                           <br>
abuse, it should be remembered that restoration to membership does not remove all consequences of such a serious violation. While attendance at church activities may be permissible with properly established guidelines, a person convicted or disciplined for sexual abuse should not be placed in a role which could put them in contact with children, youth, and other vulnerable individuals. Neither shall they be given any position which would encourage vulnerable individuals to trust them implicitly.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Church Manual, Chapter 7, Discipline, pages 66 and 67</em><br>
                           <strong>NAD - YOUTH/CHILDREN’S MINISTRY VOLUNTEER CODE OF CONDUCT</strong><br>
                           <strong>(To be adapted by SDA Legal Department of your local field)</strong><br>
                           <strong>Acknowledgment</strong><br>
Because I want the best possible environment for our children and youth to grow up in, it is important that those working with children have guidelines for conduct in order to protect both themselves and those under their care. As a ministry volunteer, I want parents and others to feel comfortable and confident with me.<br>
                           <strong> </strong><br>
                           <strong>My Commitment to Volunteer Ministry</strong><br>
As a Youth/Children’s Ministry Volunteer, I will:<br>
Provide appropriate adult supervision at all times for the children for whom I am responsible.<br>
Have at least one other adult, eighteen (18) years of age or older, to help with the supervision of children. If I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find myself in a situation where I am the only adult present, under no circumstances will I allow myself to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alone with one child (the “two-person rule”). This protects the child as well as protecting the adult from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible allegations.<br>
Ask a child’s permission before physically touching him/her anywhere, even when responding to an injury or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem. This is especially true for any areas that would normally be covered by a T-shirt and/or shorts. If an&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; injury is within this area, make sure another adult works with you as care is provided. <br>
Refrain from physical and verbal attacks and corporal punishment which are inappropriate behaviors and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should never be used as discipline. “Time outs” or “sit-in-that-chair” may be helpful discipline methods to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use with children.<br>
Affirm children with appropriate touching by keeping hugs brief and “shoulder-to-shoulder” or “side-to-si&nbsp;&nbsp; de.” I will keep hands at (not below) the shoulder level. For small children who like to sit on laps, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encourage them to sit next to me.<br>
6.Provide extra care when taking small children to the restroom. I will take another adult along, or leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door open.<br>
Be aware of conducting activities in rooms that do not have an interior viewing area, or I will leave the door&nbsp;&nbsp; open during the activity to allow easy observation by others.<br>
Cooperate with the volunteer screening process and complete the Volunteer Ministry Information form, as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; required by the church.<br>
                           <strong>S</strong><br>
                           <strong>AMPLE</strong><br>
Be aware of the signs and symptoms of child abuse and aware of the legal requirements for reporting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suspected cases of abuse. In addition to any legally required reporting, I agree that if I become aware of any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior by another individual which seems abusive or inappropriate towards children I am supervising,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will report that behavior to the church pastor, elder, or directly to the Conference Treasurer’s or Risk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management Director.<br>
10.Cooperate with church leadership in conducting children and youth ministries by being a volunteer who is&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loving, kind, firm, and always a thoroughly professional person. Working with children and youth is not only&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a privilege; it is also a serious responsibility that must be approached with utmost care.<br>
11.Participate in orientation and training programs conducted by the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide extra care when taking small children to the restroom. I will take another adult along, or leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door open.<br>
12.Uphold the standards of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
* In the event I find it impossible to comply with the above, I will comply as closely as possible with the Code of Conduct and act in good faith for the welfare of the people involved.<br>

                           <strong>Developmental Growth | PYSO 104</strong><br>
This workshop describes the mental, spiritual, <br>
physical, and social growth and needs of the <br>
typical Pathfinder and how to relate to them <br>
effectively. It includes practical pointers on <br>
leading, nurturing, and discipling them. The <br>
objective of this seminar is to enable leaders <br>
to help Pathfinders mature in the full stature <br>
of Jesus Christ.<br>
                           <strong>Discipling and Discipline | PYSO 121</strong><br>
This workshop will consider the Biblical <br>
meanings of discipline and disciple. Christ <br>
gave us the perfect example of discipling. It <br>
will look at Christ’s methods of evangelism as <br>
shared in Scripture and the practical lessons <br>
that we can draw from His methods and ap<br>
-<br>
ply to our ministry. It then continues with the <br>
concept that disciplining requires the heart <br>
of Jesus.<br>

This workshop discusses developing a men<br>

                           <strong>Safety and the Counselor | RCSF 120</strong><br>
This workshop focuses on the moral and practical obligations of the counselor to guard the well-being of unit members. It includes a review of physical safety issues, supervision policies and rationale, health concerns, transportation issues, abuse prevention and intervention, and accident reporting and response, all primarily from the unit viewpoint rather than the club viewpoint.<br>
                           <strong>Spiritual Applications in Nature | NAOS 120</strong><br>
This workshop will help club leaders encourage Pathfinders to develop a love of nature and for their Creator. It will use the lessons discovered in nature to help Pathfinders with character development and their walk with Jesus.<br>
                           <strong>Required Fieldwork</strong><br>
Create a portfolio that contains the handouts and your personal notes from the workshops <br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual59<br>
                           </strong><br>
                           <strong>Portfolios </strong><br>
The Counselor certification requires a portfolio documenting the journey, progress, lessons learned, and completion of requirements. The portfolio should include a completed certification check sheet and evidence confirming requirement completion. This evidence can come in the form of signed class cards or signin sheets, class handouts and/or photographs of participants leading or involved in, or proof of applicable research and projects completed as required fieldwork.<br>
The purpose of the portfolio is not only to show completion of all the certification requirements, but also to be an authoritative referral source when faced with similar issues in the future.<br>
The physical portfolio can be a three-ring binder or folder in which all materials are kept. However, a fully digital data collection is also acceptable.<br>
The content is what counts, not the form of that content. It should be well organized and easy to check over.<br>
Items should be labeled for easy connection to a specific requirement. The form will vary according to the personality and style of the participant.<br>
                           <strong>Portfolio Review</strong><br>
The purpose of the review is to confirm completion of the requirements. It is not to require conformity to any system requiring specific formats of style of presentation. Portfolios are reviewed to determine if they are complete or incomplete. An incomplete portfolio will be returned to the participant with a written explanation of what needs to be added, corrected or complete. Portfolios, whether complete or incomplete, should be returned to the participant in a timely manner.<br>
Review of completed portfolios will be done by an invested Master Guide appointed by the Conference Youth Director or their designee.<br>
                           <strong>Recognition of Completion<br>
                           </strong>Upon completion of the required workshops, the participant is awarded an enameled pin and certificate of completion.<br>
Achievement and honors. Discuss the three fundamentals at teaching concepts and their objectives:<br>
Achievement: Young people need to experience successful completion of worthwhile tasks with a sense of purpose. Responsibility: Young people should learn to accept and faithfully carry responsibility in accordance with age and experience.<br>

                           </strong><br>
Respect for authority: Young people need to understand and accept the principle of authority.<br>
                           <strong>Learning Styles </strong><br>
Learning Styles are simply different approaches or ways of learning. Most of us have a preferred style, but also have the ability to learn via other styles as well. There are three primary learning styles: visual learner (learn through seeing), auditory learners (learn through listening), and tactile/kinesthetic learners (learn through moving, doing, touching). Effective teachers intentionally teach in ways that engage their students in as many learning styles as possible.<br>
Discuss the characteristics of each learning style.<br>
Conduct a learning styles evaluation with your participants.<br>
Ask your participants to identify the learning style that describes them best.<br>
                           <strong>Special Circumstances</strong><br>
In special cases, provisions can be made for isolated Pathfinders to participate in the program. Likewise, provision can be made for the physically handicapped and the disadvantaged.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Teaching Styles </strong><br>
Often, teachers teach in the style with which they are most comfortable. Great teachers use teaching styles that are most effective for the learning styles of their students. It is important that teachers become effective with as many teaching styles as possible so they can adjust and adapt when needed.<br>
Give specific examples of how to teach Investiture Achievement requirements or a Pathfinder honor in a way that engages multiple learning styles. <br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Teaching Environments</strong><br>
In Pathfinder club ministry, it is important that teachers and instructors can teach in varied environments such as classrooms and outdoor amphitheaters, from driving down the road to sitting around a campfire, from playing games in a camp lodge to rappelling side by side. Not only does the setting determine the style of teaching, but also the number of students being taught.<br>

                           <strong>Key Texts: </strong> <strong>Luke 10:25-37 NKJV.</strong> “And behold a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, ‘Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?’ He said to him, ‘What is written in the law? What is your reading of it?’ So he answered and said, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.’ And He said to him, ‘You have answered rightly; do this and you will live.’ But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, ‘And who is my neighbor?’ Then Jesus answered and said: ‘A certain man went down from Jerusa-<br>

                           </strong>who fell among the thieves?’ And he said, ‘He <br>
who showed mercy on him.’ Then Jesus said <br>
to him, ‘Go and do likewise.’” <br>
                           <strong>Matthew 25:31-37 NKJV. </strong><br>
“’When the Son of <br>

one from another, as a shepherd divides his <br>
sheep from the goats. And He will set the <br>

answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see <br>

You drink? When did we see You a stranger <br>

And when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. Likewise a Levite, when he arrived at the place, came, and looked, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion. So he went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, when I come again, I will repay you.’ So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him asmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to Me.’”<br>

                           <strong>What Your Participants Will Learn</strong><br>
1. Participants will learn about the value of having their Pathfinder Club involved in outreach and effective ways to reach out to their community.<br>

                           <strong>Workshop Content<br>
Understand how Investiture Achievement requirements enable spiritual growth.</strong> <br>
The mission of Pathfinders is to bring children to Jesus. The Investiture Achievement (IA) curriculum is the backbone of Pathfinder club ministry. It has three sections common to each Investiture Achievement level that intentionally facilitate spiritual development: Personal Growth, Spiritual Discovery, and Serving Others. In this workshop, we will research and explore each of these sections.<br>
Activity: Have participants look over the Companion and Trail Companion scope and sequence. Review the Personal Growth section, specifically 3.b. The Pathfinder staff help the Pathfinder understand and practice the meaning of “Be pure, kind and true” and “Keep the morning watch” and Go on God’s errands.” <br>
                           <strong>2.Encourage spiritual growth in Pathfinders through the Bible and history.</strong><br>
Pathfinders has proven to be one of the great soul-winning agencies of our church, with a leadership that dedicates its time, talents, and energy to keeping the program running smoothly. It Is designed to help Pathfinders sense their God-given destiny and to keep them marching together in step toward the kingdom of God.<br>
Activity: Review the Spiritual Discovery section of Investiture Achievement, Companion level, noticing all four components that the Pathfinders are required to learn. How can you incorporate these requirements into your meetings? Do you have specific individuals in mind who can assist you? <br>
                           <strong>3.Engage Pathfinders in connecting with their community through Share Your Faith activities.</strong><br>

                           </strong>Pathfinders should teach members how to become good citizens of their communities. Involving Pathfinders in the community fosters an interest in service to others. Clubs can impact their communities in many ways. Organization is one of the key components to successful community-service projects. Community-service projects also present great opportunities to involve parents and other church members. Ask for their help in finding projects and organizing the finer details. The more people you include, the more you can accomplish.<br>
Activity: Review the Serving Others section of the Investiture Achievement for Friend, Companion, and Explorer level. <br>
4.I<strong>ntegrate additional outreach events into your club calendar.<br>
Eva</strong>ngelistic outreach is important to the Pathfinder program. Planning group outreach activities will encourage Pathfinders to share their faith. However, there is a difference between evangelistic outreach and community service projects. Both are important to include when planning your calendar. Look for ways to include an evangelistic component in the club’s activities. <br>
Activity: Include these in your club’s schedule, keeping in mind what may be appropriate for a certain month or season.<br>
Make a care package for a child or youth experiencing homelessness.<br>
Make “I Care” kits with combs, toothbrushes, shampoo, etc. for individuals experiencing homelessness.<br>
Help clean up and mow a public place.<br>
Adopt a “Grand friend.” Write your “grand friend” a letter or write letters for an older adult.<br>
Put together care packages for families of patients in the ICU.<br>
Collect and repair used bicycles for children or families in need.<br>
Build birdhouses and donate them to a nature center.<br>
Mow an older person’s lawn.<br>
Hold a grandparents’ tea at a local retirement or nursing home. Combine the activity with a lesson on good manners for younger students and your Pathfinders will have an opportunity to demonstrate good behavior. <br>
Plan activities for Grandparents Day.<br>
Clean graffiti off neighborhood walls and buildings.<br>
Explore more ideas with your group. Closing Activity <br>
Clos<strong>ing Activity<br>
Hav</strong>e your participants divide up into small groups to discuss how these passages apply to Pathfinder Club Ministry.<br>
Luke<strong> 10:25-37<br>
Chr</strong>ist shared this parable in response to the question, “Who is my neighbor?” The real neighbor, Jesus says, is the person who shows mercy in concrete ways. He commanded His <br>
                           <br>
Club<strong> Ministry Training Manual65 foll</strong>owers, “Go and do likewise.” This story is particularly important because Jesus chose to make the exemplary individual, the Good Samaritan, a member of an ethnic group that was despised, looked down upon and discriminated against by the religious community to which Jesus belonged. Following Jesus is about the content of your character, not your race, culture, or gender.<br>
2.Matt<strong>hew 25:31-46<br>
Thi</strong>s parable is the last in a series of four parables that Jesus shared in Matthew 24-25 in response to questions from His disciples about end-time events: “When will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” At the end of time the righteous say, “When did we see you” as a stranger, needing clothing, imprisoned, sick (Matt. 25: 38-39)? Discuss how your club shows Christ’s love to others in practical ways.<br>

                           <strong>Key Texts:&nbsp; Luke 22:24-27.</strong> “Now there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the greatest. And He said to them, ‘The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors. But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who governs as he who serves. For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.”<br>

And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all.”<br>

However, in Pathfinder club ministry, instead of a top-down system, we have a circle of support where counselors surround the Pathfinder and parents/family who are at the center of the circle as the most important since they are the ones working with and serving the young people within their unit. They have the most contact with a young person. Counselors have the opportunity to have a significant influence on their lives.<br>

                           <strong>COUNSELORS</strong><br>
As the one working the closest to the Pathfinder, you will be the one encouraging them on as they climb the last hill on a long hike, giving them high-fives for a job well done on the drill and marching field, praying with them and crying with them over a devastating event in their lives, and by God’s grace … the one who assists them in their commitment to Jesus Christ and the decision to live their lives for Him.<br>
                           <strong>PARENTS AND JUNIOR COUNSELORS</strong><br>
You should include parents and junior counselors as part of the team working with and for your Pathfinders.<br>
                           <strong>SUPPORT STAFF</strong><br>
Next come the support staff – instructors, cooks, drivers, club secretary, and treasurer – all working to fill in the necessary functions to ensure that clubs make the most of events and programs.<br>
                           <strong>CLUB DIRECTOR</strong><br>
Cl<strong>ub Ministry Training Manual71<br>
                              <br>
                           </strong>Then comes the associate or deputy director followed by the director – each doing his or her part to organize and coordinate activities to provide the counselor with more opportunities to build a relationship with their units, as well as rapport, confidence, trust, and, most importantly, an opportunity to help the Pathfinder build a lifetime saving relationship with Jesus Christ. Once this has taken place, the cycle can begin again with the Pathfinder becoming part of a support system for the next generation’s young people.<br>
LOCA<strong>L CHURCH<br>
We </strong>also need the support of the local church pastor and the church board. Make sure they are part of the team supporting the counselors and the club, understanding the focus is discipleship ... not just a “club for kids.”<br>
CONF<strong>ERENCE TEAM<br>
Bey</strong>ond the local support comes the area coordinator and conference director, again each doing his or her part to organize and coordinate activities to provide the counselor with even more opportunities to work with their Pathfinders.<br>
The counselor’s role is to provide intentional discipleship to the Pathfinder.<br>
All club energies need to focus through the counselor to disciple the child and support their parents or guardians.<br>
ADDI<strong>TIONAL CONTENT<br>
Muc</strong>h time could be spent here talking about servant leadership and mentoring from the book Education, the chapter: Lives of Great Men. <br>
Sugg<strong>ested Activities<br>
Hav</strong>e each participant create a circle of support with the names of the people that support them (captain/scribe, if a unit has been assigned, other club staff, pastor/elder, area coordinators, conference).<br>
Form groups of 3 to 4. Brainstorm what your club can do to make sure that your club is intentionally discipling your Pathfinders. <br>
How is the counselor part of that process? Repo<strong>rt to the entire group.<br>
For</strong>m groups of 3 to 4. From the leadership or mentoring part of the presentation, have participants identify an area that they are going to work on in the coming year. Share with their small group.<br>

                           <strong>Key Texts:&nbsp; Micah 6:8:</strong> “He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?” <strong>Luke 10: 28b-27:</strong> “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?’ He said to him, ‘what is written in the law?

Opening Activity: The Observation </strong><br>
                           <strong>Game</strong><br>
Have participants form two lines of equal number and facing each other.<br>
Have them introduce themselves to the person they are facing and share where they are from.<br>
Then have participants do an about-face. Instruct them to change six things about their appearance. After an adequate amount of time, have them do an about-face and then have one row of participants guess what six things the person in front of them changed. Then switch and have the other row of par-<br>
                           <br>
 also watching you, so it is important that you be a great role model. Here are some important things for each counselor to model:<br>
                           <strong>Attendance and participation in all&nbsp;&nbsp; Pathfinder functions.</strong><br>
Counselor should <strong>always</strong> be with unit unl ess pre-arranged for someone else to fill in.<br>
Counselors need to know their kids well and become <strong>acquainted</strong> with families and home conditions.<br>
Counselors should always defend the standards and principles of their club and work together with other staff in the club.<br>
Counselors should set a good example with <strong>attitude</strong> and behavior.<br>
2.<strong>Code of counseling:</strong> Do what you <br>
want the kids to do; don’t do what you don’t want them to do.<br>
Take <strong>charge</strong> and lead/teach your unit or class.<br>
Work and stay with your unit during <strong>all</strong> programs.<br>
Encourage, teach, and test necessary <strong>level requirements</strong> for the successful Investiture of your club members.<br>
Set a good <strong>example</strong> in neatness, <strong>attend-</strong><br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual75<br>
                           </strong><br>
the uniform.<br>
Be a role model in <strong>Christian</strong> behavior.<br>
March and <strong>drill</strong> with your unit.<br>
Develop understanding and <strong>friendship</strong> within the unit.<br>
h.Help members with any<strong> problems</strong> and keep the club leaders informed (respect confidentiality when appropriate).<br>
Encourage your unit members to <strong>participate</strong> in all activities.<br>
Participate with your unit in <strong>campouts, activities/events,</strong> arranging all details with the deputy director/director.<br>
Attend your club’s <strong>staff</strong> meetings and retreats.<br>
Notify the club director in advance if unable to <strong>attend</strong> a meeting.<br>
3. Have a <strong>working knowledge</strong> of all Pathfinder functions.<br>
What does all this mean? When you get in a car you have a working knowledge. You may not understand the workings of an internal combustion engine, but you know the following:<br>
It needs fuel.<br>
It doesn’t ride well when a tire on one side is flat.<br>
Locking the keys in your car doesn’t help you get to your destination quickly.<br>
The car will hide under snow in wintertime. Every vehicle is different.<br>
The same is true of Pathfinder events. You need to know the basics of how they work and the purpose of each function.<br>
For example, Inductions are a perfect way for new club members to commit to the club. We need to resist the tendency of having each event become common and dull, and emphasize the importance, difference, and purpose of each type of function.<br>
Community service – purpose: to spread the love of Jesus.<br>
Investiture – purpose: to honor the Pathfinder for a job well done.<br>
Pathfinder Sabbath – give your Pathfinders the opportunity to share about their Pathfinder club with their church.<br>
                           <strong>“Fall In.”</strong><br>
The counselor falls in at <strong>the back </strong>of the unit whenever the director calls, “Fall in.” Counselors should be listening as the announce-<br>
                           <br>
ments are given and be able to reinforce them as the Pathfinders are doing what has been requested. Do what you want the kids to do; do not do what you don’t want them to do.<br>
5.What is the counselor’s <strong>duty during craft and honor time?</strong><br>
The counselor is with their unit during crafts and honors as much as possible.<br>
If you are not teaching the honor, work with your Pathfinders and assist the instructor.<br>
The counselor’s foremost concern should be helping their Pathfinders rather than completing the requirements for themselves.<br>
Be careful just to assist, not do, the requirements for the Pathfinder.<br>
                           <strong>6. What is the counselor’s responsibility during duties (camporees, camp setup, etc.)?</strong><br>
Answer: work with the kids and not sitting, watching, and giving orders. If you get in and work with your kids, the following will happen:<br>
The task is done <strong>quickly.</strong><br>
The unit members will be more <strong>responsive.</strong><br>
Everyone will have more <strong>fun.</strong><br>
You get to know your unit members <strong>better.</strong><br>
Often these opportunities can be used as <strong>“teachable moments”.</strong><br>
                           <strong>The Uniform</strong><br>
Help the Pathfinders take <strong>pride</strong> in their uniform by encouraging and setting a good example with your own uniform. Uniforms are not everybody’s favorite thing. For the kids, the uniforms may be just out of style clothes. <strong>Counselors can model pride in the uniform by wearing it with care. Remember the uniform is not just clothes, but rather, who we are and what we believe in. Ask yourself, “Do I want to be a wrinkled Christian?”</strong><br>
8.<strong>Am I, the counselor, responsible for discipline in my unit?</strong><br>
Yes, but do not be afraid to ask for help! Simple issues can be worked out within the club. More serious issues such as inappropriate behavior of staff or abuse problems need to go to the director, pastor, or conference Pathfinder director.<br>
9.<strong>How do I always keep the Pathfinders under control?</strong><br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual77<br>
                           </strong>The number one goal is to stay <strong>together </strong>in a unit.<br>
Have <strong>expectations</strong> for your unit. Tell your unit you expect them to:<br>
Be quiet and respectful.<br>
Be with you at all times.<br>
Follow directions.<br>
It is disruptive for a speaker, craft instructor, or director to have to ask a Pathfinder to be quiet.<br>
Set the <strong>example</strong> and let your unit know your expectations <strong>ahead of time. </strong><br>
10. <strong>Organization:</strong><br>
Conselors and staff<br>
Director or assistant director (if director is not available)<br>
Pastor and/or church board<br>
Area coordinator<br>
Conference Pathfinder director<br>
11. Counselors are always with their unit. We are responsible for these kids. We need to know where they are at all times, not only for their safety, but also for our peace of mind. If you can’t supervise them for any reason, leave them under the supervision of another responsible staff member.<br>
                           <strong>Counselor’s Responsibilities At:</strong><br>
1. Club Meetings<br>
During worship: sit, listen, and pray with Pathfinders.<br>
During assembly: fall in and participate with unit.<br>
During crafts or honors: make sure your Pathfinders are engaged and following instructions.<br>
During recreation: play with your unit, show good sportsmanship, and set a good example.<br>
2. Campouts<br>
Enforce sleeping arrangements as specified by your conference.<br>
Make sure that your unit has the full camporee experience.<br>
Follow camporee rules.<br>
Have worship time, review the speaker’s message to answer questions and reinforce the message.<br>
Get involved at all parts of setting up the camp with a positive attitude.<br>
Field trips: have knowledge of the trip, stay with the unit, and have fun!<br>
Hiking: stay with your unit, follow rules of trail, enjoy, and learn from nature.<br>
Fairs and camporees: stay with your unit, participate in all activities with a good attitude, have a great time, be a good witness, follow all the rules, do not forget worships, and help with the labor of set-up and striking camp.<br>
Pathfinder Sabbath: wear full dress uniform, march with unit, complete all assignments as designated by director, encourage your unit members, and talk with parents and other church members.<br>
District functions:&nbsp; stay with unit, follow rules, assist when needed—you and your unit <strong>have fun!</strong><br>
Share your faith activities: work with your unit! Your excitement for sharing your faith will be contagious!<br>
Fundraisers: stay<strong> with</strong> unit. Work alongside unit. Follow rules and directions. Witness to all involved. Make work fun! What is the common thread in all these functions?<br>
                           <strong>Suggested Activities<br>
Role Play</strong><br>
Divide your entire group into discussion groups of no more than three to four. Give each group a scenario. Use typical situations that might happen within a normal Pathfinder Club. For example, when a Pathfinder says, “I don’t want to wear my uniform,” “I hate it here. I want to go home,” or “Nobody likes me. God doesn’t even like me.” Others might include:<br>
What to do when a Pathfinder is noisy and misbehaving during a meeting<br>
The club or unit is out hiking, and somebody sits down and does not want to go any farther.<br>
You have a couple that won’t do anything unless they are allowed to be together. Provide group discussion time. Then have each group share, via role playing, with the whole group what their scenario is and how they have decided to resolve the issue in a way that honors God and keeps the Pathfinder Law and Pledge.<br>

What Your Participants Will Learn 1. Know the different characteristics of junior and teen Pathfinders.<br>
Study components of the Pathfinder curriculum which enable youth to grow as Jesus did (Luke 2:52).<br>
Discover concepts that strengthen Pathfinder involvement by meeting developmental needs.<br>
                           <strong>Workshop Content<br>
                           </strong>Prophecy. This curriculum is designed for the <br>
different stages of growth and development. <br>
It exists to lead children and young people to <br>
Christ and to help them grow in Christ. From <br>
our ministry, we have seen that each Path<br>
-<br>
finder is unique! Yet Pathfinders share de<br>
-<br>
velopmental characteristics with their peers. <br>
Counselors should remember this paradox <br>
as they make plans to mentor the children in <br>
their care, and to make potential necessary <br>
adjustments. <br>
                           <strong>Overview of Junior</strong><br>
                           <strong> Pathfinders (ages 10-12) </strong><br>
Activity characterizes this stage of develop<br>
-<br>
ment, and the social group usually involves <br>
a cluster of same-sex friends—the “friendly <br>
gang age.” Reality as they perceive it tends <br>
to be dualistic with most things either right <br>
or wrong, yes or no, good or bad. Pathfind<br>
-<br>
ers can tap into specific rules and rewards, <br>
plus plenty of action whether it’s camping, <br>
service activities, fundraising, marching, or <br>
camporees. The mind can absorb lots of in<br>
-<br>
formation although it might not be able to <br>
process it with depth.<br>
Let’s get into some specifics about junior <br>
can be learned during this stage.<br>
The Pathfinder curriculum, both Investiture Achievement and honors, is designed on the principles of Scripture and the Spirit of Pathfinders. The energy level they brought with them from Adventurers continues, but they have longer endurance. Sitting still can seem unbearable, especially to many boys. This doesn’t mean they shouldn’t learn when and where to sit still but providing opportunities for activity taps their natural inclination. This includes a fair amount of noisiness, and boys tend to be this way more than girls who seem to also be capable of high-energy activities but seem to be able to sit quietly better than boys.<br>
Mental development hits squarely on what is concrete or tangible. The vivid imagination from the previous stage seems to evaporate and for something to be real it must be experienced. Science experiments captivate junior Pathfinders. This is the best stage for quizzes because the mind is able to store an incredible number of facts but understanding them seems beyond their capability unless they can memorize what an adult has given for the meaning. This is the stage in which a Pathfinder can read a passage of Scripture flawlessly but be completely perplexed when asked what the passage means or to state it in their own words. But this skill <br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual81<br>
                           </strong><br>
The noticeable social development is the separation of gender. They simply don’t want to be together. With quiz time the obvious division of teams is boys versus girls (although the girls will usually win unless one boy is especially full of Bible trivia).<br>
Juniors Pathfinders rarely like to be alone but prefer to be in small groups that can easily fluctuate with various members, rarely mixing genders. The differences in gender start to get noticed, and some females start puberty during these years. Pathfinders of this age look for heroes, such as sports, music, and movie stars. The teens or young adults at your church can fill this role more likely and in reality. Bible heroes may also fit. Fostering emotional development for junior Pathfinders hits the target with acceptance. This can be difficult to give when they are noisy and restless. Be careful not to humiliate, especially around others. They can be quite sensitive to criticism. Being fair is important but being part of the group is even more important. Junior Pathfinders can sometimes be very mean to others, often with no apparent reason. They want adult relationships, but also the ability to be part of a small peer group, too. Teen Pathfinders can play significant roles in addition to adults.<br>
What happens spiritually with Junior Pathfinders? Information equals spirituality— whatever spirituality means. Knowing God is knowing about God more than a personal relationship with an unseen and powerful Being or intimacy with “El Shaddai “or “Abba.” This is the most common age for children who grow up in the church to get baptized. Children can understand the plan of salvation and how to give their hearts to Christ. The Junior Pathfinder’s knowledge of Scripture provides the foundation for a lifelong commitment to God, and the emotional anchor for the stresses of life. Junior Pathfinder’s spiritual development is strengthened through Bible stories and the spiritual disciplines: prayer, and aspiring to: “Keep the morning watch, Walk softly in the sanctuary, Keep a song in my heart, Go on God’s errands.” The commitment Junior Pathfinders make to Christ is real but will need to be reviewed and deepened in the adolescent years. <br>
                           <strong>Suggested Activity</strong><br>
Discuss how the Pathfinder Investiture <br>
Achievement levels accommodate the devel-<br>
                           <br>
opmental needs of 10- to 12-year-olds.<br>
                           <strong>Overview of Teen ººPathfinders (ages 13-16) </strong><br>
The dramatic changes within these years rival those of the first two years of life, except children at this age are leaving childhood, and at uneven and irregular times, with females often changing a year or two before most males. The onset of puberty (physical changes) affects all other areas of life as well, throwing social and spiritual certainties into disequilibrium. Authority begins to be questioned as experimentation begins regarding one’s identity and relationships with others. Thinking in new ways becomes possible and impacts potentially positive and negative outcomes.<br>
The onset of puberty in teens marks the greatest physical impact. It affects all other areas of a teen’s life as well.<br>
The average age for the onset of puberty in females is 10-11, with one’s first menstruation at the age of 12-13. Boys hit puberty a year or two after girls do. Please note that these are averages. A child has no control over when this begins. Unfairly, girls who reach puberty early are at a disadvantage because it tends to separate them from age mates and puts them with older teens. And boys who reach puberty early are at an advantage because it tends to engender more respect and also puts them more in line with females their age while the “little boys” continue their immature ways. These physical changes markedly affect the other aspects of a teen’s life.<br>
Teens also experience dramatic mental changes.<br>
The brain begins another round of development that connects reasoning. It doesn’t happen all at once but is a process throughout the teen years. The change can be seen with thought processes of reasoning from cause to effect. But this is sporadic. The teen Pathfinder might seem extra mature one week and then backslide a year or two the next week. One 13-year-old might be more advanced than a 14-year-old, at least this week. And teens start to ask “why?” questions such as, “Why did sin begin?” or, “Why do we go to church?” or, “Why hasn’t Jesus returned yet?” These questions may have been asked and answered many times previously, but the teen is now able to listen in new ways and needs to hear reasons again.<br>
The social changes for a teen Pathfinder re-<br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual83<br>
                           </strong>volve around peer acceptance and identity development. With a sense of leaving childhood and entering adulthood, a teen begins to challenge authority such as parents or teachers. This can be very intimidating, so the teen looks to other teens for acceptance and support. The fact that a teen Pathfinder can challenge the counselor or other staff member is a “win” for the teen, even if the teen loses the challenge. This is because the teen Pathfinder was “in the fight.” Expect multiple attempts to discover what a teen Pathfinder is good at in the search for identity based on achievements or relationships. Expect this to be a process, and one that causes many adults to pray with greater intensity. Teens who are compliant often get rewarded by adults but are likely to experience a more traumatic identity search later if it is put on a back burner now.<br>
Not surprisingly, the emotional development for teen Pathfinders is also rocky. In addition to the volatile physical, mental, and social changes, a teen also experiences new emotions—feelings without names to even get a handle on them. A female who reaches puberty may feel exhilarated that an older boy pays attention to her romantically (in comparison to the immature boys her own age), but then feel uncomfortable when the boy tries to take advantage of her young age of development. A boy who is late reaching puberty may feel left out or cheated because he can’t compete with those his own age. Insecurity seems to be a common feeling throughout this age, with occasional relief that never seems to last long enough. With so many changes at unpredictable rates and times, insecurity is the normal emotional state.<br>
Spiritual development for teen Pathfinders can go one of several ways. With so many changes, one common route teens take is to begin to experiment with their spirituality. Some begin to understand it in a new way. As they separate from authority figures, some reject their understanding of God simply to differentiate from their religious parents. This can certainly alarm parents as they navigate new waters with their early adolescents. Some teens continue with the spiritual exterior they have learned, but it seems phony or put-on to them, as though they are acting on a stage for others. Doing what another person wants them to do doesn’t seem real to them, but they might now know what is real. Hopefully, teen Pathfinders will wrestle with God and discover God for themselves, a process which may involve a rocky path all its own.<br>
This could be initiated outside of the regular routines of life, such as when away on a mission trip or a weekend campout, or at a summer away from home, or even in a parttime job. This is the time that what was memorized during the junior stage needs to come off the back burner to experience meaning and not merely be memorization. Those baptized earlier often want to be re-baptized when their spirituality becomes personal to mark their new experience that seems so much more real than what it had been previously.<br>
Such radical changes can be expected with teens in your Pathfinder Club! And what is most challenging is that the 13- and 14-yearolds aren’t quite youth. Often this age group gets neglected, merging them with immature juniors or older youth. Leaders effective with either age group often give up on Explorers and Rangers quickly because they are in transition.<br>

                           <strong>Summary</strong><br>
We have made some broad sweeps and some applications for various ages or stages of children. The purpose is to give us an overview of what can be expected, but we will need to adapt this to meet the specific needs of the children to whom we minister. This illustrates what a unique and creative God we serve. And differences continue and expand into ever greater diversity into adulthood.<br>
Let’s close with these questions. Please share them with your small group of 2-3 people and close with prayer.<br>

Description<br>
                           </strong>This workshop will consider the Biblical meanings of discipline and disciple. Christ gave us the perfect example of discipling. It will look at Christ’s methods of evangelism as shared in Scripture and the practical lessons that we can draw from His methods and apply to our ministry. It then continues with the <br>
                           <br>
concept that to discipline, you need the heart of Jesus.<br>

Opening Activity</strong><br>
We are going to start this workshop by studying what Jesus did when He was on earth. Divide your attendees into groups and distribute the references below. Have the groups identify one word in each text that describes what Jesus did to reach people with the good news of the Gospel. Then each group reports that word to the entire group. If you have fewer than 6 groups keep going until all the verses have been covered. You may want to write these on a board or poster for future reference.<br>

Which of these methods or other methods work best for Pathfinders?<br>
How did Moses suggest that we teach God’s principles?<br>
“And ye shall teach them to your children, <strong>speaking</strong> of them when thou sit in thine <strong>house</strong> and when thou <strong>walk</strong> by the way, when thou <strong>lie </strong>down, and when thou <strong>rise up.</strong>” Deut. 11:19 (emphasis supplied)<br>
                           <strong>Discipline – An Act of Discipling</strong><br>
Let’s talk about some principles of discipline and how discipline is really an act of discipling • Education, Chapter 34: Discipline “The object of discipline is the training of the child for self-government. He should be taught self-reliance and self-control. Therefore as soon as he is capable of understanding, his reason should be enlisted on the side of obedience. Let all dealing with him be such as to show obedience to be just and reasonable. Help him to see that all things are under law, and that disobedience leads, in the end, to disaster and suffering. When God says ‘Thou shalt not,’ He in love warns us of the consequences of disobedience, in order to save us from harm and loss.” Educ. 287 “Lead the youth to feel that they are trusted, and there are few who will not seek to prove themselves worthy of the trust. On the same principle, it is better to request than to command; the one thus addressed has the opportunity to prove himself loyal to right principles. His obedience is the result of choice rather than compulsion.” Educ. 290 “Rules should be few and well considered; and when once made, they should be enforced.” Educ. 290<br>
“The youth have an inborn love of liberty; they desire freedom; and they need to understand that these inestimable blessings are to be enjoyed only in obedience to the law of God. This law is the preserver of true freedom and liberty. It points out and prohibits those things that degrade and enslave, and thus to the obedient it affords protection from the power of evil.” Educ. 291<br>
“The true object of reproof is gained only when the wrongdoer himself is led to see his fault and his will is enlisted for its correction. When this is accomplished, point him to the source of pardon and power. Seek to preserve his self-respect and to inspire him with courage and hope. This work is the nicest, the most difficult, ever committed to human beings. It requires the most delicate tact, the finest susceptibility, a knowledge of human nature, and a heaven-born faith and patience, willing to work and to watch and wait. It is a work than which nothing can be more important.” Educ. 292 “The Savior’s rule “As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to the likewise” (Luke 7:31)—should be the rule of all who undertake the training of children and youth. They are the younger members of the Lord’s family, heirs with us of the grace of life Christ’s rule should be sacredly observed toward the dullest, the youngest, the most blundering, and even toward the erring and rebellious.” Educ. 293<br>

What<strong> Your Participants Will Learn<br>
How</strong> to effectively build a relationship with each Pathfinder in their unit.<br>
Work<strong>shop Content<br>
Opening Activity: The Ball Game<br>
Thi</strong>s activity involves passing various sized balls down two lines of participants who are facing each other and whose arms are inter-linked. The ball must not touch the ground along the way. The facilitator starts with a large beach ball, representing the ideal Pathfinder who is always compliant, arrives on time, participates in all activities, wears their uniform with pride, etc. Once the team succeeds with this challenge, you continue using progressively smaller and more challenging sized balls or objects.<br>
 Each ball represents a type of Pathfinder one might encounter in a club. Other balls might include a soccer ball or football. To represent what more can be done.<br>
If done well and thoughtfully, this can and has been a fabulous, eye-opening time of sharing, dialogue, and realization with counselors/staff.<br>
Addi<strong>tional Discussion Questions:<br>
•Di</strong>d you communicate?<br>
•Did a leader standout among the participants?<br>
•Did you have to work together?<br>
•Did participants find solutions as the task got harder?<br>
Cont<strong>ent<br>
(Thi</strong><em>s workshop encourages discussion, prioritization, and interaction throughout. Allow time throughout the workshop for participants to discuss the concepts being presented and to share their experience.)<br>
In </em>this workshop we are going to define what a relationship is and how you, as a counselor, can develop a meaningful relationship with the Pathfinders in your unit.<br>
1. Relationship = noun (according to Webster):<br>
“The way in which two or more people or <br>
                           <br>
connected.<br>
b.The way in which two or more people or groups regard (respect) and behave towards each other.”<br>
2. What is my relationship in the club?<br>
The club is the way you and your unit of kids are connected.<br>
You are a club counselor in charge of a unit.<br>
What else do we need?<br>
i. Mutual respect ii. Emotional association 3. Name some appropriate emotions:<br>
a._________________________________<br>
_________________________________ <br>
_________________________________ <br>
_________________________________<br>
_________________________________<br>
_________________________________(joy<em>, exuberance, firmness, kindness, gentleness, anger, peacefulness)<br>
Dis</em>cuss: Is anger ever appropriate?<br>
__________________________________ <br>
__________________________________<br>
5.Positive RelationshipsOur influence on a child is usually directly proportionate to our relationship, either positive or negative, with the child. In other words, if we want to have a positive influence on the child, it is most likely to happen within a positive relationship.<br>
6.The Counselor’s ExampleYou can set a good example by: a. Being on time<br>
Wearing your uniform<br>
Being involved in all the club functions<br>
Drinking and/or eating only healthy things<br>
Praying with the child.<br>
7. A Child’s Perception<br>
But if that child perceives you as uncaring, harsh, angry, or unfair, your influence will be minimal, and the respect quotient will be on the low end of the scale.<br>
The Bottom Line<br>
You will have a relationship one way or another, positive or negative. Jesus said being sunk to the bottom of the sea with a millstone around the neck is preferred over having a negative (offensive) relationship with one of His little ones. You can control many kids with anger and threats. They will do anything to keep you from getting angry and reaping the rewards, but what kind of influence is that?<br>
So how do we create a positive relationship with each of our unit charges, even those who most challenge us?<br>
Pray for each one of them individually in your own quiet time. Do not just mention their name or the unit as a group. Really talk to God about each kid—something like, “Ok God, I know you love Johnny, and you know him very well. I don’t. But I’d like to. Here’s where I’m struggling, Lord. Johnny is always talking—can’t get him to be quiet and let anyone else talk. And what he says is usually just stupid to get attention.”<br>
Stop and listen to what God may put in your mind after each sentence. You’ll be amazed at how He will help you or who He may send to help you. But He will help you. Pray for the quiet, not-troublemakers, too—they often are left out because of all the time and attention Johnny takes. Yes, it takes time, but if you want to be able to help this kid to heaven, time is what it takes.<br>
Remember, Jesus spent 3&nbsp; years discipling just 12 men. Yes 100 or so of their friends were hanging around, but Jesus’ focus was on His club unit.<br>
2.Learn to know and understand each unit member. Yes, it’s a big job to know each one. But that’s why there should only be six in a unit.<br>
3.Listen to what they are saying with your ears, mind, and heart.<br>
4.Understand where your Pathfinders are in developmental growth is important.<br>
5.Understand the personality of each unit member.<br>
6.Visit the child’s home when all the family is there (if possible):<br>
Be sure to call ahead for an appointed time to visit.<br>
This can help you understand much about your Pathfinder:<br>
i. Why he is so meticulous or messy ii. Why she whines all the time iii. Why he talks so loud and so incessantly iv. Why food is so important to her.<br>
The visit can also help you determine if there are needs such as: i. Loss of job/work ii. Lack of food or poor diet iii. Clothing needs iv. How the Pathfinders or church can assist the family<br>
It gives opportunity to explain the Pathfinder Club Ministry to the parents.<br>
Club M<strong>inistry Training Manual<br>
e.To</strong> pray with the family. This lets the whole family know that both you and God care about them. It usually creates a positive connection, so the family knows you are there to support them.<br>
Find at least one positive thing about each unit member and write it down.<br>
At a unit meeting, have each of the kids write one good thing about each kid in the unit, including themselves.<br>
Compile the list and give a copy to each member.<br>
You may be amazed at the fact that the “Johnny’s” in your unit have at least 6 positive traits that you can build on.<br>
It can make a great difference in their lives.<br>
Many times, troublemakers don’t realize they have anything good to offer anyone.<br>
9. Let them know you care. Divide in groups of 2 and list ways to show you care:<br>
a.__________________________________ <br>
b.__________________________________ <br>
c.__________________________________ <br>
d.__________________________________ <br>
e.__________________________________ <br>
f. __________________________________ <br>
(appropr<em>iate touch, including in activities, listen, encourage, praise)<br>
10. Lea</em>d by example and involvement.<br>
No shouting or giving orders from across the gym.<br>
If it’s KP time for your unit, say, “Come on, let’s get this job done.” Then roll up your sleeves and help. You need to delegate, but not desert.<br>
Make it fun with laughter, singing, good clean jokes.<br>
11. Engage the kids in prayer.<br>
Help them find God as a friend.<br>
Pray before an event. Then if things are going rough during the event, help them stop and talk about their frustrations to their best Friend (God) and help them realize His calming effect.<br>
Pray after or during an event. Perhaps there is a neat thing that happens during.an event. Allow time with them to say thank you to their Friend and praise Him for His goodness.<br>
Pray when someone is discouraged.<br>
Pray when you don’t know why. You may just feel impressed to pray with them and you aren’t sure why. Tell them that and ask them to join you in your prayer.<br>
12. Develop a positive relationship. Once you’ve established a positive relationship with each child, it makes all the other parts <br>

of your responsibilities much easier. Kids will do almost anything for someone who demonstrates caring in a positive way. Use this positive relationship in the best interest of the child.<br>
a. Create teachable moments. Teachable moments can best be used when you have a good, positive relationship with the child.<br>
What is a teachable moment?<br>
i. An opportunity to teach practical lessons. ii. A time when you have the unit’s attention. iii. A time when you are willing to listen. b. Three types of participation:<br>
i. The talker ii. The quiet child iii. The child who wants to answer the question but never gets the answer right<br>

f. __________________________________ (involvement, listening, advice, Scripture, discussion, remove distractions, don’t be critical)<br>
Here Are<strong> Some Other Ideas:<br>
Never b</strong>e critical or ignore.<br>
Always find something good to say about every response.<br>
Use reflective listening.<br>
Plan time for discussion.<br>
Ask open-ended questions. Questions with yes or no answers don’t lead to discussion.<br>
Ask your kids for their advice. Say, “What should I do?”<br>
Read a Scripture story and ask your Pathfinders to explain it.<br>
Check your emotions. Are you wound up?<br>
Don’t dominate the discussion. Get your kids involved by asking questions and affirming their answers.<br>
Never be afraid to admit or say, “I’m sorry/ wrong.”<br>
Eliminate distractions, such as:<br>
Bugs<br>
TVs and electronic devices<br>
12.Allow your unit members to state their opinions and feelings without criticism.<br>
13.Is there something unresolved that happened earlier that is distracting the minds of the unit members?<br>

Keys for<strong> Dealing with Problems<br>
Listen </strong>on their level. Physically sit or kneel for level eye contact. Emotionally listen to understand their developmental level.<br>
Don’t lecture.<br>
Remember you were young once.<br>
Remember they may be feeling awkward.<br>
Show you care with your words and your eyes.<br>
Offer help if needed.<br>
Keep confidentially (unless laws or ethics require you report to authorities: i.e. law enforcement, director, parents).<br>
Always be available. If you seem too busy or preoccupied, they won’t confide in you.<br>
Don’t respond with big words.<br>
Don’t be the know it all. They will shut you out.<br>
The only emotion you should show is that you care. No gasping! No shock!<br>
Here Are Some Tips to Make It Fun!<br>
I must be positive about the event, even if I voted against it at staff meeting. I do it for my “kids.”<br>
Remember the power of prayer:<br>
Pray for a fun spirit.<br>
Pray for an attitude adjustment.<br>
Ask God to help your kids have a positive experience in this activity.<br>
Take time to pray for each individual child before each event.<br>
Show eagerness and excitement for your unit and God’s sake. Get in the middle of the activity and watch your excitement rub off.<br>
Remember the positive relationship you built with all in the unit. Even the troublemaker will soon cooperate.<br>
Be early to events and greet each of your unit with a:<br>
Glad smile<br>
Appropriate hug or slap on the back<br>
6. Make sure each child:<br>
Understands the event and/or activity<br>
Knows the appropriate uniform or dress they will need for the event<br>
Knows what equipment they need and how to use it<br>
Knows how to do their part to be ready for the event<br>
Knows when, where, and what time the event is to take place.<br>
If a child is struggling to get ready for an event, be patient. If you observe frustration, come alongside the child to help rather than reacting in an overbearing way.<br>
Give special, kind, and caring attention to children who are having trouble with focusing or staying on track.<br>
Create some type of incentive to be there and do their part. Very often just knowing you are going to be there with them and that you care about them will be all the incentive that is needed.<br>
Make it fun and meaningful—you may be a no-nonsense person and may have to really work at the definition of fun as it is translated to kids.<br>
When you ask your unit how to make it fun, each child may have a different definition of fun. This may be okay if you can incorporate it all at once.<br>
Never make a child feel their idea is not a good one. It may need to be put on hold, but never allow an idea to be made fun of or ridiculed or put down by you or anyone else. Using such fun-making or ridicule is one of the most effective ways to break a positive relationship and to let a child slip through the cracks.<br>
10.Some have never learned to enjoy the sounds of nature—wind in trees, creek singing across the stones, birds singing, crickets, frogs, coyotes singing near camp at night, etc. Some may have never experienced the joy of doing something for someone else for the fun of it. This isn’t always easy, especially if you’ve got kids in your group who have never learned how to have fun without a smart phone in their hands. We may need to teach them by example.<br>
Suggeste<strong>d Activity<br>
Discuss</strong> when and how we can lead Pathfinders to Jesus: after campfire time, on a campout, on a hike or beside the river on a Sabbath afternoon. Sometimes kids are very quiet; this may be an indication that their heart has been touched. This may be a good time to interact with the Pathfinder and ask them if they would like to have Jesus live in their heart. It is very important to pray for the salvation of each of our Pathfinders, and to be sensitive to the working of the Holy Spirit on a Pathfinder’s heart.<br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;"><span style="color:#000000;"/>This workshop focuses on the moral and practical obligations of the counselor to guard the well-being of unit members. It includes a review of physical safety issues, supervision policies and rationale, health concerns, transportation issues, abuse prevention and intervention, and accident reporting and response. We will be looking primarily from the unit viewpoint rather than the club viewpoint.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">1. Begin all activities with prayer and planning.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">“Because you have made the LORD, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place, no evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.” Psalm 91:9-13, NKJV </span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">“My son, let them not depart from your eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion; So they will be life to your soul and grace to your neck. Then you will walk safely in your way, and your foot will not stumble.” Proverbs </span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;"></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;"><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;"/>Proper for each activity and for the age group using it</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Removed or destroyed if faulty or broken</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">5. Supervision</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The required degree of supervision will vary according to the grades or ages of those being supervised. Naturally 10-year-old kids will require more supervision than someone who is 15 years old and should accept a greater degree of responsibility for his/her own actions.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Stress that Supervision must ALWAYS be provided. Adventist Risk Management reports that two-thirds of all claims involve allegations of improper supervision, not regarding the number of supervisors but rather the quality of supervision.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Never leave children out of your sight.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Establish rules and parameters/boundaries and stick with them—Be consistent!</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">While supervising it is not time for personal phone calls, paperwork, or talking with friends and/or associates. The counselor should eliminate all distractions while supervising.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">If you have a challenging group, enlist additional help.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;">6. High-Risk Activities</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Think twice before planning high risk activities, and consider the following:</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Suitability of the activity for the age group involved</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">The personal ability and experience of supervisors</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">For example, a gymnastics program should be operated only if there is a skilled, experienced, and qualified gymnast available to supervise.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">c.	The provision of appropriate safety equipment, e.g., life jackets for boating, helmets for horse riding, helmets, and knee pads for skating, etc.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">d.	Type of activity and its inherent risks</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">e.	Number of participants staff/child ratio</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">f.	Location of activity and the condition of the equipment</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">g.	Allotted time for the activity</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">h.	Proper insurance coverage, and if insurance riders may be needed</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">i.	Counselors: Please check with your directors before doing unit activities. They can secure church board approval for activities done by unit groups.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">7. General Health Concerns</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Demonstrate good hygiene by teaching and modeling good handwashing and covering your mouth and nose when sneezing and coughing.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">What to do in your club when a child or staff has a fever?</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Prevent illness by encouraging drinking enough water, eating properly, and taking medications when they are prescribed.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">8. Transportation and Safety</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Does each vehicle have proper insurance, and is it road-worthy?</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Is each driver at least 21 years old? Have they gone through volunteer screening and background checks?</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Driver(s) must have no more than two traffic citations, or no accidents that resulted in a conviction of a misdemeanor or criminal.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Driver(s) must have had no charges while driving within the last three years. (Note: This must be adapted to your Conference.)</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">There must be a seatbelt for each person in the vehicle; review the law in your country for children and transportation requirements.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">Gross vehicle and tire ratings must not be exceeded, and pre-trip inspections must be </span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;"></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">done.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">g.	Have no transportation in open vehicles.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">h.	Pray with each driver. Pray for God’s protecting angels and guidance.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;">i.	A great resource is AdventistRisk.org safety-resources.</span><br>

                           <span style="line-height:16px;">Refrain from “counseling” regarding abuse.</span><br>
                           <span style="line-height:16px;">Be observant of possible abuse and protect unit members from further abuse.</span><br>
                           <span style="line-height:16px;">Care about each member equally and develop their trust.</span><br>

                           <span style="line-height:16px;">Give and allow only appropriate touch.</span><br>

Please do not attempt to begin any abuse investigation on your own. Leave that to the professionals.<br>
                           <span style="line-height:16px;">The director is to then report to the conference or any other appropriate entity.</span><br>
                           <span style="line-height:16px;">In some countries, child abuse must be reported immediately or at least within 48 hours.</span><br>

                           <strong>Workshop Content<br>
                           </strong>Start your workshop with prayer. Ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom to be able to discern nature’s lessons.<br>
                           <strong>According to Education, “Nature Teaching” (pp. 99-120), nature is important because:</strong><br>
 we take time to understand the mysteries of God’s creative works, we stretch the imagination. We marvel at each delicate and intricate design. Every created thing moves in perfect order and harmony. “God has provided for man subjects of thought which will bring into activity every faculty of the mind. We may read the character of the Creator in the heavens above and the earth beneath, filling the heart with gratitude and thanksgiving. Every nerve and sense will respond to the expressions of God’s love in His marvelous works.” <br>
(Ellen White, Child Guidance, p. 50) 4. As children get older and begin to better comprehend the teachings of God’s Word, nature can help illustrate Bible lessons:<br>
“Many illustrations from nature are used by Bible writers and as we observe the things of the natural world, we shall be enabled, under the guiding of the Holy Spirit, more fully to understand the lessons of God’s Word.” <br>
(Child Guidance p. 46)<br>
b.The Bible helps interpret nature’s mysteries:<br>
i. When we see thorns, thistles, and tares, the Bible reminds us that this was not what God intended. These are the results of sin! Satan, <br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual<br>
                           </strong><br>
creation. “An enemy has done this.” (Matt. <br>
13:28)<br>
ii. The story of redemption at Calvary shows God’s love that restores us. When we see the changing of the seasons, rain turning to sunshine, and blossoms closing and opening, they speak of God’s goodness and restoring power.<br>
5. Studies show that when children and young people are allowed to learn outdoors, they do much better than those who only study indoors.<br>
Students get better grades when they study an outdoor curriculum.<br>
Children who spend more time playing or moving around outdoors are healthier than those who are indoors all day.<br>
Children’s stress levels are lower when they spend time listening to the sounds of nature.<br>
When children spend time in outdoor classes, they are highly motivated to learn.<br>
As students learn how things in nature relate to each other, their awareness leads to more responsible behavior toward their natural environment.<br>
When the classroom is outside, teachers notice a significant improvement in students’ behavior. They are more cooperative and self-disciplined.<br>
Outdoor education improves communication skills among students. It gives them opportunities to problem solve and lead discussions, and it sometimes helps resolve conflict.<br>
Being outdoors allows children to develop new skills. They can learn about gardening, using a compass, building a fire, identifying edible wild plants, etc.<br>
Outdoor learning can help enhance a child’s self-reliance, confidence, and self-esteem.<br>
As young people learn about natural disasters, environmental emergencies, or wildlife crises, they begin thinking of ways to improve their environment.<br>
Memory is enhanced when children discover and experience new and unfamiliar things outdoors.<br>
                           <strong>Lessons from nature help us see practical applications and find answers to challenges in our everyday lives. Here are five items found in nature and the lessons we can learn from them:</strong><br>
1.<strong> Trees</strong><br>
                           <strong>Characteristic:</strong>&nbsp; There is a symbiotic rela-<br>
                           <br>
tionship between trees and humans/ animals. Trees give fruit, shade, and vital oxygen to both people and animals. Humans and animals give off carbon dioxide that is vital to the survival of trees.<br>
Life application:&nbsp; We should learn to use our resources to help others.<br>
Characteristic:&nbsp; When there is a fierce storm, a tree does not stay rigid; it bends and sways with the wind. It adapts to changing circumstances and is flexible.<br>
Life application:&nbsp; We should learn to embrace change and be flexible even in the face of adversity. Change can be good for renewed growth.<br>
2. <strong>Streams</strong><br>
                           <strong>Characteristic:</strong>&nbsp; Streams need to flow in order to remain uncontaminated and pure. A stagnant stream will become muddy and unclean.<br>
Life application:&nbsp; We need to keep actively working for Christ and or we will become stagnant and ineffective.<br>
                           <strong>Characteristic:</strong>&nbsp; As a stream flows, there are stones, rocks, and even boulders that can hinder the flow. Instead of stopping, a stream changes its course and flows over or around the obstacle.<br>
Life application:&nbsp; We all experience obstacles and challenges, but with God’s help we can successfully maneuver through them.<br>
                           <strong>3. Birds</strong><br>
                           <strong>Characteristic:</strong>&nbsp; Birds wake up early to hunt for worms, to feed their young, or to build their nests. They sing in order to communicate.<br>
                           <strong>Life application:</strong>&nbsp; Matt. 6:26 says, “Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?” We can sing to communicate our gratitude to God.<br>
                           <strong>4. Mountains</strong><br>
                           <strong>• Characteristic: </strong> Mountains are magnificent in their beauty and size. Mountain climbing may look intimidating, but it can be accomplished with planning and preparation. Life application:&nbsp; God can help us prepare for the future and face all challenges that come our way.<br>
                           <strong>5. Flying Geese</strong><br>
                           <strong>• Characteristic:</strong>&nbsp; Geese fly in a “V” formation because it conserves their energy by reducing wind resistance. They take turns being in front and fall to the back when they get tired. This formation also allows them to <br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual111 </strong>keep visual contact with each other, so they keep going in the right direction.<br>
Life application:&nbsp; God created us to live and work in community. When we work together to accomplish a task, the load is lighter for everyone. Working together also helps us to stay focused and keep making progress.<br>
                           <strong>Important things to keep in mind as you teach lessons from nature to Pathfinders:</strong><br>
Pray for the Holy Spirit to guide you and give you wisdom as you teach valuable lessons from nature. Pray that your Pathfinders will learn lessons that will have a positive impact on their lives.<br>
You don’t have to be an expert or know everything. Part of being an effective teacher is your willingness to learn. A great teacher is also a good student!<br>
Remember that teaching is journey of adventure, discovery, and growth in your own spiritual life. If you don’t make it a priority to stay closely connected to Jesus, you cannot expect your Pathfinders to make it a priority in their lives.<br>
There is more than one way to teach spiritual lessons through nature. Each person will have a different perspective. Keep the following in mind:<br>
Don’t be afraid to try new methods.<br>
Be patient and allow each Pathfinder to grow in their own time. Remember, your primary role is to help facilitate an environment for growth in their walk with Jesus.<br>
Allow each Pathfinder to be creative and use their imagination.<br>
Encourage Pathfinders to write down their thoughts, experiences, and the lessons they are learning.<br>
Invite Pathfinders to praise God through music while in nature. We feel thankfulness and adoration as we see all that God created. Psalmist David wrote songs and poetry that expressed his gratitude to God while out in nature. When you go on campouts with your Pathfinders, sing songs that express praise to God.<br>
Go on short hikes. City and state parks are great places to go. Go on weekend campouts and teach nature honors. Visit zoos, libraries, natural history museums, national parks, and natural environments in your area. Another great way to expose Pathfinders to nature is by watching videos and documentaries.<br>
Recruit an expert! You don’t have to know everything about nature. Perhaps your community has someone with a passion for teaching about God’s creation.&nbsp; Ask for their help!<br>

Pencils/pens<br>
Two bags for each participant to carry their collected objects from nature<br>
                           <strong>Activity Overview</strong><br>
Each participant will collect one or two objects in nature that show how God reveals His love and care for us. The last five minutes of this activity should be dedicated to sharing. Make sure that each participant has a chance to share.<br>
                           <strong>Instructions</strong><br>
You will have 12-15 minutes for this activity. Explore and collect objects and then report on your discoveries by answering the questions on the handout.<br>
As you gather your samples, place them in the bags provided. Label bags with the name of object, where it was found, and the date it was collected. (You can use this again for an object lesson in a club worship talk.) 3. Respect the local rules protecting the environment. You may not be allowed to take samples of protected wild plants or flowers, etc. In this case, take a photo of the object you want to use during the sharing time. You can also take a photo if the item is too large to fit in a bag.<br>

You will have 10-12 minutes to do this activity. Match as many as possible.<br>
Work individually without comparing answers.<br>
In the description column, fill in the blanks with either the name of the animal or the character trait. Draw lines from column 2 and 3 to the correct description.<br>
Bonus point: Write the opposite character trait in the last column. (On the sample chart, the trait is filled in, however, on the handout it should be blank. The presenter can print and cut apart the chart for each person to assemble on their own piece of paper.)<br>

Acknowledgment<br>
                           </strong>B<strong>ecause I want </strong>the best possible environment for our children and youth to grow up in, it is important that those working with children have guidelines for conduct in order to protect both themselves and those under their care. As a ministry volunteer, I want parents and others to feel comfortable and confident with me.<br>
                           <br>
My Commitment <strong>t</strong>o<strong> Volunteer Ministry<br>
As a Youth/Chil</strong>dren’s Ministry Volunteer, I will:<br>
Provide appropriate adult supervision at all times for the children for whom I am responsible.<br>
Have at least one other adult, eighteen (18) years of age or older, to help with the supervision of children. If I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find myself in a situation where I am the only adult present, under no circumstances will I allow myself to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alone with one child (the “two-person rule”). This protects the child as well as protecting the adult from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible allegations.<br>
Ask a child’s permission before physically touching him/her anywhere, even when responding to an injury or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem. This is especially true for any areas that would normally be covered by a T-shirt and/or shorts. If an&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; injury is within this area, make sure another adult works with you as care is provided. <br>
Refrain from physical and verbal attacks and corporal punishment which are inappropriate behaviors and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should never be used as discipline. “Time outs” or “sit-in-that-chair” may be helpful discipline methods to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use with children.<br>
Affirm children with appropriate touching by keeping hugs brief and “shoulder-to-shoulder” or “side-to-si&nbsp;&nbsp; de.” I will keep hands at (not below) the shoulder level. For small children who like to sit on laps, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encourage them to sit next to me.<br>
6.Provide extra care when taking small children to the restroom. I will take another adult along, or leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door open.<br>
Be aware of conducting activities in rooms that do not have an interior viewing area, or I will leave the door&nbsp;&nbsp; open during the activity to allow easy observation by others.<br>
Cooperate with the volunteer screening process and complete the Volunteer Ministry Information form, as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; required by the church.<br>
 S<br>
AMPLE<br>
Be aware<strong> </strong>o<strong>f the</strong> signs and symptoms of child abuse and aware of the legal requirements for reporting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suspected cases of abuse. In addition to any legally required reporting, I agree that if I become aware of any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior by another individual which seems abusive or inappropriate towards children I am supervising,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will report that behavior to the church pastor, elder, or directly to the Conference Treasurer’s or Risk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management Director.<br>
10.Cooperate with church leadership in conducting children and youth ministries by being a volunteer who is&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loving, kind, firm, and always a thoroughly professional person. Working with children and youth is not only&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a privilege; it is also a serious responsibility that must be approached with utmost care.<br>
11.Participate in orientation and training programs conducted by the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide extra care when taking small children to the restroom. I will take another adult along, or leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door open.<br>
12.Uphold the standards of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
* In the event I find it impossible to comply with the above, I will comply as closely as possible with the Code of Conduct and act in good faith for the welfare of the people involved.<br>

Styles | EDUC 002</strong><br>
This workshop gives a more in-depth look at the concept of teaching styles introduced in EDUC 001 (taught in Basic Staff Certification). It gives a survey of historical styles and introduces new styles. Strengths and weaknesses of each style are discussed, and participants are encouraged to evaluate their own style of teaching and take the necessary steps to become more effective instructors.<br>

                           <strong>Understanding Learning Styles | EDUC 003</strong><br>
This workshop gives a survey of the learning <br>
styles, considers how to best reach a learner, and what not to do. Participants are encouraged to evaluate the learning styles of the children in their club and determine what teaching changes they should make to become more effective in reaching their youth.<br>
                           <strong>Working with Children with Special Needs | EDUC 006</strong><br>
This seminar gives an overview of common types of special needs and promotes communication with parents and caregivers of Pathfinders who have them. It also provides suggestions about how to adapt Pathfinder activities for children with special needs to ensure that all Pathfinders can participate and be successful.<br>

 This workshop introduces various views and definitions of discipline. It then covers principles of Christian discipline and specific techniques for effective discipline.<br>
                           <strong>Required Fieldwork</strong><br>
Establish a mentoring relationship with an experienced instructor, or, even better, with a professional teacher. Document the conversations and advice that they share with you over the course of a Pathfinder year.<br>
Lead a group of Pathfinders to Investiture.<br>
Lead a group of Pathfinders to successful completion of an honor.<br>
Create a portfolio that contains the handouts and your personal notes from the workshops you attend and the mentoring you receive. In your portfolio, place copies of your teaching plans and records as your complete requirements 2. and 3.<br>
                           <strong>Portfolios</strong><br>
The Pathfinder Instructor Certification requires a portfolio documenting the journey, progress, lessons learned, and completion of requirements.<br>
The portfolio should include a completed certification check sheet and evidence confirming requirement completion. This evidence can come in the form of signed class cards or sign-in sheets, class handouts and/ or photographs of participants leading or involved in, or proof of applicable research and projects completed as required fieldwork. The purpose of the portfolio is not only to show completion of all the certification requirements, but also to be an authoritative referral source when faced with similar issues in the future.<br>
The physical portfolio can be a three-ring binder or folder in which all materials are kept. However, a fully digital data collection is also acceptable.<br>
The content is what counts, not the form of that content. It should be well organized and easy to check over.<br>
Items should be labeled for easy connection to a specific requirement. The form will vary according to the personality and style of the participant.<br>
                           <strong>Portfolio Review</strong><br>
The purpose of the review is to confirm completion of the requirements. It is not to require conformity to any system requiring specific formats of style of presentation. <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Portfolios are reviewed to determine if they are complete or incomplete. An incomplete portfolio will be returned to the participant with a written explanation of what needs to be added, corrected or complete. Portfolios, whether complete or incomplete, should be returned to the participant in a timely manner.<br>
Review of completed portfolios will be done by an invested Master Guide appointed by the Conference Youth Director or their designee.<br>
                           <strong>Recognition of Completion</strong><br>
Everyone likes to have their efforts recognized. Youth leaders who put in untold hours of prayer, planning, counseling, and training are no exception.<br>
Upon successful review of the portfolio the participant is eligible for an enameled pin and certificate of completion.<br>

2. Adjust styles to match the teaching situation and students.<br>

                           <strong>Workshop Content</strong><br>
Jesus demonstrated a variety of methods in His teaching. He used stories and illustrations, parables, questions, discussion, lecture, object lessons, and debates to communicate His message in a way that connected to His learners.<br>
Jesus adapted His teaching style to fit the specific situation. For example, when teaching the multitude on a mountainside, He addressed His learners using lecture (Matt 5-7). However, when He was alone with the disciples, He used object lessons, (John 13:5-20).<br>
 Jesus matched His teaching method with the message He needed to communicate. For example, in His encounter with the Samaritan tion of key facts, dates, names, etc. tion with the teacher. nation of both. demonstrations.<br>

 arts and crafts, it is difficult to accommodate students’ individual needs in larger classrooms.<br>
                           <strong>Facilitator</strong>—Teachers who have a facilitator model teaching style tend to focus on activities. This teaching style emphasizes student-centered learning and there is much more responsibility placed on the students to take the initiative for meeting the demands of various learning tasks. Teachers typically design group activities that necessitate active learning, student-to-student collaboration, and problem solving. <strong>Pros:</strong> This style trains students to ask questions and helps develop skills to find answers and solutions through exploration; it is ideal for teaching science and similar subjects. <strong>Cons: </strong>It challenges teachers to interact with students and prompt them toward discovery rather than lecturing facts and testing knowledge through memorization.<br>
                           <strong>Delegator</strong>—Teachers who practice a delegator teaching style tend to place control and responsibility for learning on individuals or groups of students. This teacher will often give students a choice in designing and implementing their own complex learning projects and will act in a consultative role.<br>
                           <strong>Pros:</strong> Guided discovery and inquiry-based learning places the teacher in an observer role that inspires students by working in tandem toward common goals. <strong>Cons:</strong> Considered a modern style of teaching, it is sometimes criticized as newfangled and geared toward the teacher as consultant rather than as the traditional authority figure.<br>
                           <strong>Suggested Activities</strong><br>
Break into groups. Using a record card or honor, choose a requirement and explore how the instructor can teach it to Pathfinders using the four teaching styles.<br>

Description<br>
                           </strong>This workshop presents the general outline and structure of the “Investiture Achievement Curriculum.” Special attention is given to the objectives, or intent, of the eight tracks of each level. These tracks are: <br>
Personal Growth, Spiritual Discovery, Serving Others, Making Friends, Health and Fitness, Nature Study, Outdoor Activities, and Honor Enrichment. Understanding the intent supporting each track will help leaders implement specific Investiture Achievement requirements and/or modify and combine them as needed for teaching their unique group of young people. The workshop will include practical suggestions for creative and dynamic instruction focused on active learning.<br>

                           <strong>Workshop Content<br>
Ideas for Workshop Presentation and Activities</strong><br>
The objective of Investiture Achievement is to provide a means by which Pathfinders can be trained in service for God and as good citizens of their communities. There are six levels of Investiture Achievement determined by age: Friend (10), Companion (11), Explorer (12), Ranger (13), Voyager (14), and Guide <br>
(15).<br>
                           <strong>The eight tracks and the intent for each track</strong><br>
1. Personal Growth: Understanding that God values each Pathfinder contributes to the Pathfinders’ development of positive self-<br>
                           <br>
 tivities. sponsibility.<br>
cedures. stewardship.<br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual </strong>finders to develop life and problem-solving tools. In the Outdoor Living track, Pathfinders perform outdoor skills, solve outdoor challenges, and participate in outdoor team activities. Outdoor activities offer Pathfinders relationship building time with their mentors.<br>
 8. Honor Enrichment: Once a Pathfinder has completed an Investiture Achievement level, she or he can then complete the honor enrichment and other advanced-level activities for that Investiture Achievement level. Honor enrichment promotes personal growth and allows Pathfinders to explore their interests by earning new honors, learning new skills, and studying new content areas. Honor enrichment provides opportunities for Pathfinders’ accomplishments to be acknowledged publicly by the church and community. Public acknowledgment increases Pathfinders’ sense of self-worth. At the close of the school year, Pathfinder Investiture services provide a meaningful affirmation of the responsibilities and accomplishments of each Pathfinder.<br>

                           <strong>When and how Investiture Achieve-</strong><br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>ment might be taught in your club year</strong><br>
It is important that staff understand the scope and sequence of Investiture Achievement, how their individual level of curriculum fits into the big picture, and how to teach it. There is a variety of methods for tracking the Pathfinders’ progress such as using wall charts, record cards, and journals.<br>
                           <strong>Teaching Investiture Achievement to Pathfinders</strong><br>
Investiture Achievement (IA) is the core curriculum for Pathfinder ministry. It needs to be taught in a way that meets the individual needs of the Pathfinders. This may look different from one year to the next. Due to time limitations, it is not possible to complete all of the requirements during a Pathfinder meeting. At-home work teaches the Pathfinder responsibility and accountability. Instructors should follow up with Pathfinders between meetings to encourage and remind them of at-home work. Finding the best way to connect with the Pathfinder whether it be by text, sending a note home or on social media is key for success in this area. Involving parents in encouraging their Pathfinder can be effective as well.<br>
                           <strong>Practical application of ideal, creative instruction</strong><br>
The ideal model for teaching Investiture Achievement incorporates lecture, group activity, and synthesis and application. These three components often can be given equal time depending on the content of the lesson. Following this model, class participants can be instructed to create and present a plan for teaching or adapting an Investiture Achievement lesson to one of the suggested activities. Many members have helped the cause of Pathfinders especially if the members have children in the club.<br>
                           <strong>Suggested Activities</strong><br>
Review 2 to 3 club calendar examples of incorporating Investiture Achievement work into the Pathfinder schedule and create a calendar for your club.<br>
Accommodate Investiture Achievement to individual and special needs.<br>
Adapt Investiture Achievement to different ages.<br>
Teach an Investiture Achievement level to teach the skills they are learning to others <br>

                           <strong>Investiture Achievement Structure </strong><br>
                           <strong>Track Objectives</strong><br>
                           <strong>Personal Growth</strong>—Understanding that <br>
God values each Pathfinder contributes to Pathfinders’ development of positive selfworth and encourage confidence in the abilities given to them by God. To aid Pathfinders in this understanding, the Personal Growth track encourages each Pathfinder to have a personal relationship with Jesus through a daily devotional life, Bible study, and prayer. In this track Pathfinders also learn how to apply the Pathfinder Pledge and Law to words, actions, and beliefs. Jesus is relevant in all facets of the Christian way of life.<br>
                           <strong>Spiritual Discovery</strong>—Hearing stories of <br>
God’s love, protection, and guidance in the lives of real people makes God come alive for Pathfinders. In the Spiritual Discovery track, Pathfinders grow spiritually through the study of real people in the Bible and Christian history. Become familiar with the Bible’s structure by being able to find its books. Appreciate its relevance and apply its principles. <br>
 Discover God’s will for our lives in the Bible.<br>
                           <strong>Club Ministry Training Manual<br>
Serving Others</strong>—Focusing on the needs of others encourages Pathfinders to embrace all of God’s diverse family. In the Serving Others track, Pathfinders experience the joy of service through outreach, friendship evangelism, and other church or community activities. Use their spiritual gifts and witness for Jesus.<br>
                           <strong>Making Friends</strong>—Establishing friendships <br>
promotes positive spiritual and social growth. In the Making Friends track, Pathfinders learn how to be a friend to others, to the community, and to the planet. Pathfinders have the opportunity to model the positive benefits of a Christian lifestyle, develop and apply morals and values, and demonstrate civic responsibility. Exhibit the characteristics of being a good friend. Appreciate all peoples and cultures in your community. <strong>Health and Fitness</strong>—Learning God’s prin-<br>
ciples for a healthy life teaches Pathfinders of God’s concern for their physical, emotional, and mental health. In the Health and Fitness track, Pathfinders apply health and fitness principles, share these principles with others, and practice basic first aid and safety procedures. Good health and physical fitness are an integral part of practical religion. <br>
Know and choose the God-given principles of good health in our lifestyle.<br>
                           <strong>Nature Study</strong>—Exploring nature is an exciting way for Pathfinders to experience God. In the Nature Study track, Pathfinders learn about God through observation of nature, time spent outdoors, and environmental stewardship. Learn that God’s character is revealed in nature. Appreciate nature through observation and taking care of their environment.<br>
                           <strong>Outdoor Living</strong>—Practicing outdoor liv-<br>
ing skills is a fun and challenging way for Pathfinders to develop life and problem-solving tools. In the Outdoor Living track, Pathfinders perform outdoor skills, solve outdoor challenges, and participate in outdoor team activities. Use Christian standards to guide our choice of recreational activities. Biblical principles should influence our attitude while participating.<br>
                           <strong>Honor Enrichment</strong>—Once a Pathfinder <br>
has completed an Investiture Achievement level, she or he can then complete the honor enrichment and other advanced level activities for that Investiture Achievement level.<br>
 Honor enrichment promotes personal growth and allows Pathfinders to explore their interests by earning new honors, learning new skills, and studying new content areas. Honor enrichment provides opportunities for Pathfinders’ accomplishments to be acknowledged publicly by the church and community. Public acknowledgment increases Pathfinders’ sense of self- worth. Develop skills to prepare for future situations in life.<br>

                           <strong>Workshop Content<br>
Key Text: 1 </strong>Kings 19:11-12. “Then He said, ‘Go out, and stand on the mountain before the LORD.’ And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.” (1 Kings 19:11-12).<br>
Turning up the volume often does not get the response we want in a discipline situation because it triggers defensive fear or flight reactions that shut down productive thought. God spoke in a still, small voice when He needed to discipline His weary prophet.<br>
 What is the purpose of discipline? The purpose of discipline is to win disciples for Christ. Discipline has both an outward and an inward emphasis, each with different purposes. External discipline is correction from someone else to change or correct bad behavior. Internal discipline sets a precedent for the future by internalized moral guidelines that we are determined not to violate. This workshop examines both types of discipline within the context of being a director of a Pathfinder club. We are working with a group of young people transitioning between a need for exhave to follow up. needed for persistent problems.<br>

they happen, and you will be able to warn the child. Often a gentle pat on the shoulder is all that is needed to help the Pathfinder know that you know what is happening or about to happen.<br>
Sometimes a kind word helps a child through a trouble spot. Another tactic is diversion. A dose of reality helps through frustrated times. Praise the positive. Allow a child to save face.<br>
Allow honesty. It should be a place where they can feel “peace” (within the Club)—this is at “Church”. We should encourage honest answers (as long as Pathfinders are respectful) so that we can help them to see all sides and to expand their thinking. We should challenge them. And we certainly should make them feel like their ideas are welcome and often useful.<br>
Stay cool. Don’t overreact. The worst thing you can do is lose your mind in a crisis or in a heated moment. Your calm will be like cold water on a fire.<br>
Remember that young people reflect the mood of the leaders (especially the ones they respect.) So when we need to adopt a posture of correction, we should convey the attitudes we want to see reflected back.<br>
 Take time to learn the facts. Try to hear all sides before making a judgement. Often there are good reasons for what happened. Never accuse. If you do make a mistake and jump to conclusions, you need to admit your mistake. Young people are forgiving. They are also resilient.<br>
Realize what hat you are wearing. We are all volunteers; we may have minimal counseling skills. But we can try to see the real problem. Sometimes outward expressions are just the smoke of the fire that is burning inside. Often all a young person needs is to have someone who is willing to listen. To help with this, see if you can have the young person evaluate their own actions. Remember, the goal is internal discipline.<br>
Never ridicule. Self-worth is fragile in adults, but extremely so in young people. Pathfinder club is all about building this up, not tearing it down. We correct for the purpose of building better people for service to God and others.<br>
                           <strong>How to educate staff</strong><br>
 It is important to know what our response is before we get into a discipline situation. As directors, it is equally important that we get all of our staff on the same page regarding on. dures you will follow in discipline situations.<br>

                           <strong>NAD - YOUTH/CHILDREN’S MINISTRY VOLUNTEER CODE OF CONDUCT</strong><br>
                           <strong>(To be adapted by SDA Legal Department of your local field)</strong><br>
                           <strong>Acknowledgment</strong><br>
Because I want the best possible environment for our children and youth to grow up in, it is important that those working with children have guidelines for conduct in order to protect both themselves and those under their care. As a ministry volunteer, I want parents and others to feel comfortable and confident with me.<br>
                           <strong> </strong><br>
                           <strong>My Commitment to Volunteer Ministry</strong><br>
As a Youth/Children’s Ministry Volunteer, I will:<br>
Provide appropriate adult supervision at all times for the children for whom I am responsible.<br>
Have at least one other adult, eighteen (18) years of age or older, to help with the supervision of children. If I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find myself in a situation where I am the only adult present, under no circumstances will I allow myself to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alone with one child (the “two-person rule”). This protects the child as well as protecting the adult from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible allegations.<br>
Ask a child’s permission before physically touching him/her anywhere, even when responding to an injury or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem. This is especially true for any areas that would normally be covered by a T-shirt and/or shorts. If an&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; injury is within this area, make sure another adult works with you as care is provided. <br>
Refrain from physical and verbal attacks and corporal punishment which are inappropriate behaviors and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should never be used as discipline. “Time outs” or “sit-in-that-chair” may be helpful discipline methods to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use with children.<br>
Affirm children with appropriate touching by keeping hugs brief and “shoulder-to-shoulder” or “side-to-si&nbsp;&nbsp; de.” I will keep hands at (not below) the shoulder level. For small children who like to sit on laps, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encourage them to sit next to me.<br>
6.Provide extra care when taking small children to the restroom. I will take another adult along, or leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door open.<br>
Be aware of conducting activities in rooms that do not have an interior viewing area, or I will leave the door&nbsp;&nbsp; open during the activity to allow easy observation by others.<br>
Cooperate with the volunteer screening process and complete the Volunteer Ministry Information form, as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; required by the church.<br>
                           <strong>S</strong><br>
                           <strong>AMPLE</strong><br>
Be aware of the signs and symptoms of child abuse and aware of the legal requirements for reporting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suspected cases of abuse. In addition to any legally required reporting, I agree that if I become aware of any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior by another individual which seems abusive or inappropriate towards children I am supervising,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will report that behavior to the church pastor, elder, or directly to the Conference Treasurer’s or Risk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management Director.<br>
10.Cooperate with church leadership in conducting children and youth ministries by being a volunteer who is&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loving, kind, firm, and always a thoroughly professional person. Working with children and youth is not only&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a privilege; it is also a serious responsibility that must be approached with utmost care.<br>
11.Participate in orientation and training programs conducted by the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide extra care when taking small children to the restroom. I will take another adult along, or leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door open.<br>
12.Uphold the standards of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
* In the event I find it impossible to comply with the above, I will comply as closely as possible with the Code of Conduct and act in good faith for the welfare of the people involved.<br>

                           <strong>Development | PFAD 141</strong><br>
It is a challenging task to develop the Pathfinder club yearly calendar.

The physical portfolio can be a three-ring binder or folder in which all materials are kept. However, a fully digital data collection is also acceptable.<br>
The content is what counts, not the form of that content. It should be well organized and easy to check over.<br>
Items should be labeled for easy connection to a specific requirement. The form will vary according to the personality and style of the participant.<br>
                           <strong>Portfolio Review</strong><br>

Portfolios, whether complete or incomplete, should be returned to the participant in a timely manner.<br>
Review of completed portfolios will be done by an invested Master Guide appointed by the Conference Youth Director or their designee.<br>

Key Text:</strong> 1 Kings 19:11-12. “Then He said, ‘Go out, and stand on the mountain before the LORD.’ And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.” (1 Kings 19:11-12).<br>
Turning up the volume often does not get the response we want in a discipline situation because it triggers defensive fear or flight reactions that shut down productive thought. God spoke in a still, small voice when He needed to discipline His weary prophet.<br>
What is the purpose of discipline? The purpose of discipline is to win disciples for Christ. Discipline has both an outward and an inward emphasis, each with different purposes. External discipline is correction from someone <br>

tasks. Sometimes it helps a young person with a lot of energy to “shadow” the director. • Plan program carefully. Any spare moments that are unused by you (the leaders) will be used by Pathfinders in a chaotic manner. Start and end on time. Move from activity to activity with energy, knowing what is coming next.<br>
Anticipate. See potential problems before they happen, and you will be able to warn the child. Often a gentle pat on the shoulder is all that is needed to help the Pathfinder know that you know what is happening or about to happen.<br>
Sometimes a kind word helps a child through a trouble spot. Another tactic is diversion. A dose of reality helps through frustrated times. Praise the positive. Allow a child to save face.<br>
Allow honesty. It should be a place where they can feel “peace” (within the club)—this is at “church.” We should encourage honest answers (as long as Pathfinders are respectful) so that we can help them to see all sides and to expand their thinking. We should challenge them. And we certainly should make them feel like their ideas are welcome and often useful.<br>
Stay cool. Don’t overreact. The worst thing you can do is lose your mind in a crisis or in a heated moment. Your calm will be like cold water on a fire.<br>
Remember that young people reflect the mood of the leaders (especially the ones they respect.) So when we need to adopt a posture of correction, we should convey the attitudes we want to see reflected back.<br>
Take time to learn the facts. Try to hear all sides before making a judgement. Often there are good reasons for what happened. Never accuse. If you do make a mistake and jump to conclusions, you need to admit your mistake. Young people are forgiving. They are also resilient.<br>
Realize what hat you are wearing. We are all volunteers; we may have minimal counseling skills. But we can try to see the real problem. Sometimes outward expressions are just the smoke of the fire that is burning inside. Often all a young person needs is to have someone who is willing to listen. To help with this, see if you can have the young person evaluate their own actions. Remember, the goal is internal discipline.<br>
Never ridicule. Self-worth is fragile in adults, but extremely so in young people. Pathfinder club is all about building this up, not tearing it down. We correct for the purpose of building better people for service to God and others.<br>
                           <strong>How to educate staff</strong><br>
It is important to know what our response is before we get into a discipline situation. As directors, it is equally important that we get all of our staff on the same page regarding discipline before that situation arises.<br>
                           <strong>Development of club strategie</strong>s<br>
What is effective discipline? Discipline is effective when a person learns what behavior is not acceptable and why. It may include punishment, explanation (hinders relationship with God, keeps one from achieving goals, infringes on rights of others), a behavior contract.<br>
When we understand what the Pathfinder is going through, the discipline we employ is as effective as possible. External discipline should be redemptive, not vindictive. Violence of any type is never to occur. Never punish in anger or to get revenge. Always correct with thought in mind that you want this person to be close to you in the future, not that you want them to “go away.” <br>
Verbal Interaction—what we normally do with our voices.<br>

Esta</strong>blishing trusting relationships between staff and parents. Dealing with parents is similar to appropriate Christian relationships with any human being. Focusing on sufficient communication, honesty, and affirmation builds rapport. Treat each situation separately and learn to speak the truth with love. The need for communication: This is probably the most crucial element of dealing with parents.<br>
Expectations for Pathfinders, as well as schedule updates, can be given out by email, as well as in a parent meeting. When new <br>

when others are not genuine and sincere. Be yourself, and don’t be ashamed of that, realizing that not all families may fully agree with you. Live each moment as if you are in the presence of Jesus. Be open and honest about mistakes you have made; this goes a long way towards building trust with parents. Be the first to apologize and make things right, don’t wait for others to do so, even if they may have been upset unnecessarily.<br>
Tech<strong>niques for relating with difficult situations<br>
Be </strong>willing to take criticism. This is one of the most complicated and difficult parts of being a director. Some parents either help too much or criticize too much and can be a hindrance as staff.<br>
Ideally, Pathfinders are at the age when they need and even thrive under small amounts of separation from parents.<br>
However, it is unavoidable in small churches/ clubs, and most clubs would not exist without parental help. Therefore, it is crucial to have very clear communication about expectations for parental staff from the very beginning of each year.<br>
When setting up staff for various classes, separate parents and kids as much as possible. However, no matter what is done, favoritism will be present, mostly unintentionally, but there, nonetheless. If you expect it, though, it loses at least some of its power. You may have to take criticism from both sides, so be willing to stand firm on your position to protect kids and remain calm and kind at all times.<br>
Learn to laugh. Almost every interaction with parents provides an opportunity to laugh. And if you love to be with people, all people, even the difficult ones, you will find even more chances to laugh, rather than times of frustration. Many of the most amusing times are with parents.<br>
Making a mental or actual notebook of things that amuse you can help to alleviate the stress of difficult interactions. If there is nothing that you can find to laugh about in the situation, spend more time than you normally would in talking to God about your confusing and painful experiences. He is the only one who can turn our mourning and trials into joy and peace through His presence and strength.<br>

                              <br>
Each</strong> situation and interaction with parents is different. You cannot usually directly apply one response to the next instance. Therefore, it is always crucial to listen, listen, listen, and to watch body language and tone, before you respond. It is better to remain silent for a while or to say gently that you need more time to think before responding, rather than saying something you may regret for years. Choose to speak love into crisis, being the first to apologize, rather than reacting to the escalation of others.<br>
Take every opportunity possible to affirm kids to parents, parents to kids, as well as both to their faces. Look for ways to bridge gaps between people and to encourage community and support.<br>
Discern as much as you can of the backstory before you enter a situation with recommendations or decisions. Pray, pray, pray for wisdom as you interact with parents and Pathfinders. Always love, but never hesitate to speak the truth (in love) where it needs to be spoken.<br>
Treat parents the way you would want to be treated. Communicate clearly, speak the truth in love, and live with consistent integrity.<br>

NAD - YO<strong>UTH/CHILDREN’S MINISTRY VOLUNTEER CODE OF CONDUCT<br>
(To be </strong>a<strong>dapted by SDA Legal Department of your local field)<br>
Acknowl</strong>e<strong>dgment<br>
Because</strong> I want the best possible environment for our children and youth to grow up in, it is important that those working with children have guidelines for conduct in order to protect both themselves and those under their care. As a ministry volunteer, I want parents and others to feel comfortable and confident with me.<br>
                           <br>
My Com<strong>m</strong>i<strong>tment to Volunteer Ministry<br>
As a Yo</strong>uth/Children’s Ministry Volunteer, I will:<br>
Provide appropriate adult supervision at all times for the children for whom I am responsible.<br>
Have at least one other adult, eighteen (18) years of age or older, to help with the supervision of children. If I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find myself in a situation where I am the only adult present, under no circumstances will I allow myself to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alone with one child (the “two-person rule”). This protects the child as well as protecting the adult from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible allegations.<br>
Ask a child’s permission before physically touching him/her anywhere, even when responding to an injury or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem. This is especially true for any areas that would normally be covered by a T-shirt and/or shorts. If an&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; injury is within this area, make sure another adult works with you as care is provided. <br>
Refrain from physical and verbal attacks and corporal punishment which are inappropriate behaviors and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should never be used as discipline. “Time outs” or “sit-in-that-chair” may be helpful discipline methods to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use with children.<br>
Affirm children with appropriate touching by keeping hugs brief and “shoulder-to-shoulder” or “side-to-si&nbsp;&nbsp; de.” I will keep hands at (not below) the shoulder level. For small children who like to sit on laps, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encourage them to sit next to me.<br>
6.Provide extra care when taking small children to the restroom. I will take another adult along, or leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door open.<br>
Be aware of conducting activities in rooms that do not have an interior viewing area, or I will leave the door&nbsp;&nbsp; open during the activity to allow easy observation by others.<br>
Cooperate with the volunteer screening process and complete the Volunteer Ministry Information form, as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; required by the church.<br>
 S<br>
AMPLE<br>
                           <strong>B</strong>e<strong> awar</strong>e of the signs and symptoms of child abuse and aware of the legal requirements for reporting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suspected cases of abuse. In addition to any legally required reporting, I agree that if I become aware of any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior by another individual which seems abusive or inappropriate towards children I am supervising,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will report that behavior to the church pastor, elder, or directly to the Conference Treasurer’s or Risk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management Director.<br>
10.Cooperate with church leadership in conducting children and youth ministries by being a volunteer who is&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loving, kind, firm, and always a thoroughly professional person. Working with children and youth is not only&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a privilege; it is also a serious responsibility that must be approached with utmost care.<br>
11.Participate in orientation and training programs conducted by the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide extra care when taking small children to the restroom. I will take another adult along, or leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door open.<br>
12.Uphold the standards of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
* In the event I find it impossible to comply with the above, I will comply as closely as possible with the Code of Conduct and act in good faith for the welfare of the people involved.<br>
