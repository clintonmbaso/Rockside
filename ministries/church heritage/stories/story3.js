            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p>Some mornings, the world seems a paradise. You wake up, take a deep breath by the 
window, and look out on golden sunshine reflecting on the trees, leaf by leaf. Some moments 
make life seem so precious: the face of a beloved friend as you say good-bye, a sublime 
piece of music that perfectly matches your mood, the unexpected affection of a small child.</p>

 <p>But other mornings, the world seems a place of horror. You wake up to newspaper 
headlines screaming about yet another terrorist bombing that maimed or blinded a child, yet 
another serial killer claiming his tenth victim, yet another famine or flood or war or 
earthquake. These are moments when nothing makes sense, nothing seems fair.</p>
            
<p>What does it all mean? Can we make sense of our wonderful and terrible world? Why 
are we here? Does my life really matter to God or am I just a minor cog in some vast cosmic 
machine?</p>

                <h2>SIX DAYS TO MAKE OUR WORLD</h2>

“In six days the LORD made the 
heavens and the earth, the sea, and all 
that is in them, but he rested on the 
seventh day. Therefore the Lord 
blessed the Sabbath day and made it 
Holy.”-Exodus 20:11
            
CREATION WEEK
Day One: light; sequence of day and night
Day two: earth’s atmosphere
Day three: dry land and vegetation
Day Four: sun and moon appeared 
Day Five: birds and fish
Day six: land animals and man 
Day Seven: the Sabbath
            
The eternal, all-powerful Creator 
could have formed the world in a 
moment “by the breath of His mouth.” 
But God chose to take six days to do it-six minutes, or even six seconds would have been 
sufficient. The first chapter in the Bible, Genesis 1, describes what God created on each day 
of the creation week.
What crowning masterpiece did God create on the sixth day?
“GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE, in the image of God he created him; 
MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM.”-Genesis 1:27.
God decided to create individuals like Himself who could reason and feel and love. 
Every person is made in God’s “image.”
By the sixth day, the world was filled with plants and animals, and then God introduced 
His masterpiece of creation. According to Genesis 2:7, the Almighty formed Adam’s body 
from the dust of the ground. So when God breathed “the breath of life” into his nostrils, man 
became “a living being”-that is, he came to life. God named the first man created in His 
image, Adam, a word that simply means “man,” and the first woman, Eve, which means 
“living” (2:20; 3:20). A loving Creator saw the need for human companionship.
Fresh from the hand of God, Adam and Eve both reflected His image. God could have 
programmed beings like robots to wander contentedly about the Garden of Eden and raise 
their voices in adoration to Him. But God wanted more: real relationships. Robots can smile, 
speak, even do the dishes, but they can’t love
God created us in His image, with the capacity to think and choose, and to remember, 
understand, and love. Adam and Eve were God’s children, and inexpressibly dear to Him.

                <h2>EVIL COMES TO A PERFECT WORLD</h2>

Adam and Eve had everything to make them happy. They enjoyed perfect physical and 
mental health, living in a beautiful garden home in a flawless world (Genesis 2:8; 1:28-31). 
God promised them children and the ability to do creative thinking, and to find satisfaction 
in the work of their hands (Genesis 1:28; 2:15). They experienced face-to-face fellowship 
with their Maker. No trace of worry, fear, or sickness marred their blissful days.
How did the world change so drastically into a place of suffering and tragedy? The 
second and third chapters of Genesis tell the entire story of how sin entered our world. Read 
them at your leisure. Here is a brief summary of their contents.
Some time after God established a perfect world, the Devil came to the Garden of Eden
to tempt Adam and Eve into disobeying their Creator. God limited the Devil’s sphere of 
influence to one tree in the garden, the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” And He 
warned the first human couple to stay clear of this tree and never to eat its fruit, or they 
would die.
But one day Eve wandered over by the forbidden tree. The Devil quickly launched into 
his sales pitch. He claimed God had lied to her and that if she ate the tree’s fruit she wouldn’t 
die, but would become wise like God Himself, knowing good and evil. Tragically Eve, and 
then Adam, who had only known good, allowed the Devil to con them, and they sampled 
the forbidden fruit-thus breaking their bond of trust and obedience with God.
God planned for Adam and Eve to “rule” over our world as the stewards of God’s 
created works (Genesis 1:26). But because they broke faith with God and chose the Devil 
as their new leader, the couple lost their jurisdiction. Today the Devil claims the world as 
his and tries his best to enslave its people.
There are many times when we find ourselves doing something selfish or even cruel 
when we really want to do the opposite. Why? Because the invisible enemy, the Devil, works 
to make people fail morally.
As you read chapter 3 of Genesis, you will discover that sin caused Adam and Eve to 
hide from God in fear. Sin affected all of creation. Thorns appeared along with the flowers. 
The soil suffered from drought, and labor became a burden. Disease began to strike at 
random. Jealousy, animosity, and greed multiplied human miseries. Most terrible of all, with 
sin came death!

                <h2>WHO IS THIS DEVIL WHO INFECTED OUR WORLD WITH SIN?</h2>

“He was A MURDERER FROM THE BEGINNING,… there is no truth in him. 
When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is liar and THE FATHER OF LIES.”-
John 8:44.
According to Jesus, the Devil is the originator of sin in the universe, the “father” of sin 
and thus of murder and lying.
Thomas Carlyle, the great English philosopher, once took Ralph Waldo Emerson 
through some of the worst streets of London’s East End. As they walked along, silently 
observing the wretchedness and evil around them, Carlyle finally asked, “Do you believe in 
the Devil now?”

                <h2>DID GOD CREATE THE DEVIL?</h2>

No! A good God would not create a devil. And yet the Bible states that the Devil, along 
with the angels he had deceived, lost their place in heaven and came to our world.
“And there was WAR IN HEAVEN. Michael and his angels fought against the 
dragon, and THE DRAGON AND HIS ANGELS FOUGHT BACK. But he was not strong 
enough, and they LOST THEIR PLACE IN HEAVEN. The great dragon was hurled 
down-that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He 
was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.”-Revelation 12:7-9.
How did the Devil get into heaven in the first place?
“You were anointed as a Guardian CHERUB, for so I ordained you. You were on the 
holy mount of God;…YOU WERE BLAMELESS IN YOUR WAYS from the day YOU 
WERE CREATED till WICKEDNESS WAS FOUND IN YOU.”- Ezekiel 28:14, 15.
God did not create the Devil, He created Lucifer a perfect angel, one of heaven’s leading 
angels, standing next to God’s throne. But then he sinned-“wickedness was found in” him. 
Expelled from heaven, and posing as Adam and Eve’s friend, he became humanity’s 
deadliest enemy.

                <h2>WHY DID LUCIFER, THIS PERFECT ANGEL, SINS?</h2>

“How YOU HAVE FALLEN FROM HEAVEN, O morning star, son of the dawn! 
YOU HAVE BEEN CAST DOWN TO THE EARTH…. YOU SAID IN YOUR HEART, 
‘I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God;… I WILL MAKE 
MYSELF LIKE THE MOST HIGH.’ “-Isaiah 14:12-14.
The being who became the Devil was originally called Lucifer, meaning “day star” or 
“shining one.” In this angel’s heart, vanity and ambition began to take the place of devotion. 
The seed of pride grew into an obsession to take God’s place.
Lucifer must have worked hard to persuade other heavenly beings. It’s easy to imagine 
Satan arguing that God was holding something back from them, and that the divine law was 
too restrictive, and that God was an uncaring sovereign. He slandered the One whose 
character defines what love is.
How was this conflict in heaven resolved?
“Your heart became proud,… So I threw you to the earth.”-Ezekiel 28:17
Pride changed the chief of angels into the Devil or Satan. And in order to preserve the 
peace and harmony of heaven, he and one third of heaven’s angels who joined him in 
rebellion, had to be expelled (Revelation 12:4, 7-9).

                <h2>WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SIN?</h2>

Why didn’t God create beings incapable of sinning? If He had, there would be no 
problem of evil in our world. But God wanted people who could have meaningful 
relationships. So “God created man in His own image” (Genesis 1:27). This means we are 
free and responsible. We can decide to love God or turn our backs on Him.
God gave the angels and human beings of every generation, a spiritual nature and a 
capacity to make real choices.
“Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.”-Joshua 24:15.
God challenges the beings He created in His image to choose to do right because their 
reasoning powers tell them “God’s way is best.” And to turn from wrong because their 
reasoning powers warn against the results of disobedience and sin.
Only beings with the power to reason and choose can experience real love. God longed 
to create individuals who could comprehend and appreciate His character, freely respond to 
Him in love, and be filled with love for others. God wanted to share His love so much that 
He was willing to take the enormous risk of creating angels and people with the power of 
choice. He knew it was possible that someday one of His created beings might choose not 
to serve Him. The Devil was the first being in the universe to make that terrible choice. The 
tragedy of sin began with him (John 8:44, 1 John 3:8).

                <h2>THE CROSS MAKES POSSIBLE THE DESTRUCTION OF SIN</h2>

Why didn’t God destroy Lucifer before his sin-disease could spread? Lucifer had 
challenged the fairness of God’s government. He had told lies about God. If God had 
destroyed Lucifer immediately, the angels would have begun to serve Him from fear rather 
than from love. This would have defeated the purpose God had in creating beings with the 
power of choice in the first place.
How did anyone really know God’s way was best? God gave Satan a chance to 
demonstrate his alternative system. That’s why he was given an opportunity to tempt Adam 
and Eve. 
This planet has become a testing ground where the character of Satan and the nature of
his kingdom are contrasted with the character of God and the nature of His kingdom. Who 
is right? Who can we ultimately trust? So deceptive was Lucifer, that it has taken time for 
the beings of the universe to be fully convinced of how disastrous Satan’s alternative 
actually is. But eventually everyone will see that “the wages of sin is death” and that “the 
gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23)
Every being in the universe will then agree that:
“Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your 
ways, King of the ages… All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous 
acts have been revealed.”-Revelation 15:3, 4.
After everyone understands the deadly nature of sin and the destructive nature of 
Satan’s philosophy, God can destroy Satan and sin. He will also have to destroy those who 
stubbornly resist His grace and cling to Satan’s alternative.
God is just as anxious to resolve the problem of sin and suffering as we are to have Him 
do so. But He is waiting until He can do it on a permanent basis, and until He can both 
preserve our free will and prevent evil from ever appearing again.
God has promised to destroy sin forever by purifying the heavens and this earth with 
fire. “In keeping with his promise” we can look “forward to a new heaven and a new earth, 
the home of the righteous” (2 Peter 3:10, 13). Sin will never again infect the universe. Sin’s 
tragic results will stand out so clearly that disobedience to God will seem repugnant for all 
eternity.
Who makes possible the final destruction of the Devil and sin?
“Since the children have flesh and blood, he [Christ] too shared in their humanity so 
that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death-that is, the deviland free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.” Hebrews
2:14, 15.
At the cross the angels and the unfallen worlds saw Satan for what he was-a deceiver, 
a liar, a murderer. There he revealed his true character by compelling men to murder the 
innocent Son of God. The inhabitants of the entire universe saw how senseless and cruel sin 
really is. The cross fully unmasked Satan’s motives, and when God destroys the Devil and 
those who persist in sin, all will acknowledge that God is just.
Jesus’ death on the cross exposed Satan’s real intent before all created beings (John 
12:31, 32). The cross also revealed Christ for what He is-the Savior of the world. At 
Golgotha the power of love stood out in stark contrast against the love of power. The cross 
established beyond any question that it is self-sacrificing love that motivates God in all His 
dealings with Satan, sin, and sinful men and women.
At the cross Christ’s eloquent demonstration of God’s unconditional love decisively 
defeated the Devil. The battle had been over who should rule the world, Christ or Satan. 
And the cross settled it for all time. It must be Christ above all!
Have you discovered a relationship with the Savior who died to reveal His matchless, 
unchanging love? How do you feel about the One who came to our world as a human being 
and died in your place to save you from the results of sin? Will you bow your head just now 
and thank Jesus, and then ask Him to come in and take possession of your life?
