                <h2>General Qualifications</h2>
<p><b>Moral and Religious Fitness</b>: </p>
            
<blockquote>
            “Moreover you shall select from all the 
people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and 
place such over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of 
fifties, and rulers of tens” (Ex. 18:21).</blockquote>
            
<blockquote>
            “Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good 
reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over 
this business” (Acts 6:3).
</blockquote>
            
<blockquote>
            “Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, 
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil” (1 Tim. 3:7).
“And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, 
commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also” 
(2 Tim. 2:2).
</blockquote>
            
<p>
“A bishop [elder] then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, 
temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach; not 
given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, 
not covetous; one who rules his own house well, having his children in 
submission with all reverence (for if a man does not know how to rule his 
own house, how will he take care of the church of God?); not a novice, lest 
being puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil. 
Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest 
he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
            
<blockquote>
            “Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to 
much wine, not greedy for money, holding the mystery of the faith with a 
pure conscience. But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as 
deacons, being found blameless. Likewise, their wives must be reverent, not 
slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. Let deacons be the husbands of
one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. For those who have 
served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great
boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 3:2-13; see also Titus
1:5-11 and 2:1, 7, 8).
</blockquote>
            
<blockquote>
            “Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in 
word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Till I come, give 
attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. . . . Take heed to yourself and 
to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself 
and those who hear you” (1 Tim. 4:12-16).
</blockquote>
            
<p><b>Feeding and Guarding the Church</b>: The apostle Paul called together 
“the elders of the church” and counseled them: “Therefore take heed to 
yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you 
overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own 
blood. For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in 
among you, not sparing the flock. Also from among yourselves men will rise 
up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.
</p>
            
<p>Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn 
everyone night and day with tears” (Acts 20:17, 28-31; see also 1 Peter 5:1-3).
</p>
            
<p><b>Respecting Pastors and Officers</b></p>
<blockquote>
            “And we urge you, brethren, to 
recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and 
admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. 
Be at peace among yourselves” (1 Thess. 5:12, 13; see also 1 Tim. 5:17 and 
Heb. 13:7, 17).</blockquote>
            
<blockquote>
“The Thessalonian believers were greatly annoyed by men coming 
among them with fanatical ideas and doctrines. Some were ‘disorderly, 
working not at all, but . . . busybodies.’ The church had been properly 
organized, and officers had been appointed to act as ministers and deacons. 
But there were some, self-willed and impetuous, who refused to be 
subordinate to those who held positions of authority in the church. They 
claimed not only the right of private judgment, but that of publicly urging 
their views upon the church. In view of this, Paul called the attention of the 
Thessalonians to the respect and deference due to those who had been chosen 
to occupy positions of authority in the church.”—AA 261, 262.
</blockquote>
            
<blockquote>
“Those who hold responsible positions in the church may have faults in 
common with other people and may err in their decisions; but 
notwithstanding this, the church of Christ on earth has given to them an 
authority that cannot be lightly esteemed.”—4T 17.
</blockquote>
            
<p><b>Not Hurried Into Office</b>: “In many places we meet men who have 
been hurried into responsible positions as elders of the church when they are
not qualified for such a position. They have not proper government over 
themselves. Their influence is not good. The church is in trouble continually 
in consequence of the defective character of the leader. Hands have been laid 
too suddenly upon these men.”—4T 406, 407. (See also 5T 617 and 1 Tim. 
5:22.)</p>
            
<p><b>Those Opposing Unity Not Suitable for Office</b>: “There have of late 
arisen among us men who profess to be the servants of Christ, but whose 
work is opposed to that unity which our Lord established in the church. They 
have original plans and methods of labor. They desire to introduce changes 
into the church to suit their ideas of progress and imagine that grand results 
are thus to be secured. These men need to be learners rather than teachers in 
the school of Christ. They are ever restless, aspiring to accomplish some great 
work, to do something that will bring honor to themselves. They need to learn 
that most profitable of all lessons, humility and faith in Jesus. . . .</p>
            
<blockquote>
“Teachers of the truth, missionaries, officers in the church, can do a good 
work for the Master if they will but purify their own souls by obeying the 
truth.”—5T 238.
</blockquote>
            
<p><b>Unsafe to Choose Those Refusing to Cooperate</b>: “God has placed in 
the church, as His appointed helpers, men of varied talents, that through the 
combined wisdom of many the mind of the Spirit may be met. Men who move 
in accordance with their own strong traits of character, refusing to yoke up 
with others who have had a long experience in the work of God, will become 
blinded by self-confidence, unable to discern between the false and the true. 
It is not safe for such ones to be chosen as leaders in the church; for they 
would follow their own judgment and plans, regardless of the judgment of 
their brethren. It is easy for the enemy to work through those who, themselves 
needing counsel at every step, undertake the guardianship of souls in their 
own strength, without having learned the lowliness of Christ.”—AA 279. 
(See pp. 34, 35, 124-127.)</p>
            
<p><b>Local Membership</b>: Members in regular standing are eligible for 
election to leadership positions in the church where they hold membership. 
(See pp. 117-121.) Exceptions may be made for the following:
<ul>
            <li>Students who are members in regular standing but who, for purposes 
of education, live away from home and regularly attend a church in the area 
of their temporary residence.</li>
            <li>A conference employee assigned by the conference as pastor/leader
for two or more congregations. (See pp. 116-120.)</li>
            <li>An elder who, when necessary and with the recommendation of the 
conference executive committee, may be elected to serve in more than one 
church within a district. (See p. 79.)</li>
</ul>
</p>
            
<p>Other exceptions may be considered by the conference executive 
committee.</p>
            
<p><b>Setting Tithing Example</b>: All officers shall set an example in the 
matter of returning a faithful tithe to the Church. Anyone who fails to set such 
an example shall not be elected to church office.</p>
            
<p><b>Not Delegates Ex Officio</b>: No church officer is a delegate ex officio to 
a conference session. If the church wants an officer to serve as a delegate, it 
must elect that officer as a delegate.</p>
            
<p><b>Distributing Responsibility</b>: The church should not lay too much 
responsibility on a small group of willing officers, while others are 
underused. Unless circumstances make it necessary, election of one 
individual to several offices should be discouraged.</p>
            
<p><b>Removal and Readmission</b>: When an officer is removed from 
membership and subsequently readmitted, the readmittance does not reinstate 
the individual to the former office.

<h2>Term of Office</h2>
<p>The term of office for officers of both the church and its auxiliary 
organizations shall be one year, except where the church in a business 
meeting votes to have elections every two years in order to facilitate 
continuity and development of spiritual gifts and eliminate the work involved 
in having yearly elections. In exceptional circumstances, and in consultation 
with the conference, the term of office may be extended an additional year.
</p>
            
<p>While it is not advisable for one person to serve indefinitely in a 
particular position, officers may be elected to a new term of office.

        {
            text: `
<h2>Elders</h2>
<p><b>Religious Leaders of the Church</b>: Elders must be recognized by the 
church as strong spiritual leaders and must have good reputations both in the 
church and community. In the absence of a pastor, elders are the spiritual 
leaders of the church and by precept and example must seek to lead the church 
into a deeper and fuller Christian experience.
</p>
            
<p>Elders should be able to conduct the services of the church and minister 
in both word and doctrine when the assigned pastor is unavailable. However, 
elders should not be chosen primarily because of social position or speaking 
ability, but because of their consecrated lives and leadership abilities.
Elders may be elected to a new term of office, but it is not advisable for 
them to serve indefinitely. The church is under no obligation to elect to a new 
term of office and may choose others whenever changes seem advisable. 
Upon the election of new elders, the former elders no longer function as 
elders but may be elected to other church offices.
</p>
            
<p><b>Board of Elders</b>: Where a church has a number of elders, it should 
organize a board of elders chaired by the pastor or his/her designee and with 
the first elder or another elder serving as secretary. Such a body provides a 
way to distribute responsibility and coordinate their contributions for the 
well-being of the congregation. It also provides a training ground where 
elders are instructed in their duties. The board of elders is accountable to the 
church board.
</p>
            
<p><b>Ordination of Elders</b>: Election to the office of elder does not in itself 
qualify one as an elder. Ordination is required before an elder has authority 
to function. When a church in a business meeting votes the election of new 
elders, it also authorizes their ordination. Between election and ordination, 
the elected elder may function as church leader but not administer the 
ordinances of the church.
</p>
            
<p>The ordination service is performed only by an ordained pastor currently 
credentialed by the conference. As a courtesy, a visiting ordained pastor may 
be invited to assist. However, only on the specific request of conference 
officers would a visiting ordained pastor or a retired ordained pastor conduct 
the ordination.
</p>
            
<p>The sacred rite of ordination should be simply performed in the presence 
of the church and may include a brief outline of the office of elder, the 
qualities required, and the principal duties the elder will be authorized to 
perform. After the exhortation, the ordained pastor, assisted by other ordained 
pastors and/or local elders who are participating in the service, will ordain 
the elders by prayer and the laying on of hands. (See p. 37-38.)
</p>
            
<p>Once ordained, elders need not be ordained again if elected to a new term 
of office, or upon election as elders of other churches, provided they have
maintained regular membership status. They are also qualified to the 
deaconate.
</p>
            
<p><b>Relationship to the Pastor</b>: If the conference executive committee 
assigns a pastor or pastors to the congregation, the pastor, or senior pastor if 
more than one, should be considered the ranking officer and the local elders 
as assistants. Since their work is closely related, they should work together 
harmoniously. The pastor should not assume all lines of responsibility but 
should share these with the elders and other officers. The pastor regularly 
serving the church acts as the chairperson of the board. (See pp. 32, 138.)
</p>
            
<p>There may be circumstances, however, when it would be advisable for an 
elder to act as chairperson, with the approval of the pastor or, if the church is 
without a pastor, the conference president. The pastoral work of the church 
should be shared by the pastor and the elders. In counsel with the pastor, the 
elders should visit members, minister to the sick, foster prayer ministries, 
arrange or lead out in anointing services and child dedications, encourage the 
disheartened, and assist in other pastoral responsibilities. As undershepherds, 
elders should exercise constant vigilance over the flock.
</p>
            
<p>If the pastor is a licensed minister, the church or churches served should 
elect the pastor as an elder. (See p. 34.)
</p>
            
<p>Because the pastor is appointed to the position in the church by the 
conference, the pastor serves the church as a conference employee, is 
responsible to the conference executive committee, and maintains a 
sympathetic and cooperative relation to and works in harmony with all the 
plans and policies of the local church. Elders, who are elected by the church, 
are responsible to that body and to its board. (See below.)
</p>
            
<p><b>Work of Elders Is Local</b>: The authority and work of elders are 
confined to the church in which their election has been made. It is not 
permissible for a conference executive committee by vote to confer on an 
elder the status that is granted to an ordained pastor to serve other churches 
as elder. If that need exists, the conference executive committee may 
recommend to the church needing an elder that it invite and elect the elder of 
a nearby church to serve. Thus by election one individual may, when 
necessary, serve more than one church. Such an arrangement should be made 
only in counsel with the conference executive committee. Authority to elect 
elders is inherent in the local church and not in the conference executive 
committee. The only way one may be qualified for serving the Church at large 
is by ordination to the gospel ministry. (See pp. 33-34, 79.)
</p>
            
<p><b>Conducting Church Services</b>: Under the pastor, or in the absence of 
the pastor, an elder is responsible for the services of the church and must 
either conduct them or arrange for someone to do so. Communion services 
must always be conducted by an ordained/commissioned pastor or local 
elder. The pastor usually chairs the business meeting. In the absence of the 
pastor, and with approval of the pastor or the conference president, an elder 
should serve as chairperson.
</p>
            
<p><b>Baptismal Service</b>: In the absence of an ordained pastor, an elder shall 
request the conference president to arrange for the baptism of those desiring 
to unite with the church. (See pp. 49-54.) An elder should not officiate in the 
service without first obtaining permission from the conference president.
</p>
            
<p><b>Marriage Ceremony</b>: In a marriage ceremony the charge, vows, and
declaration of marriage are given only by an ordained pastor except in those 
areas where division executive committees have approved that selected 
licensed or commissioned pastors who have been ordained as local elders 
may perform the ceremony. (See p. 34.) Local laws may require that persons 
conducting marriage ceremonies also hold state licensure/permit to do so. An 
ordained pastor, a licensed or commissioned pastor, or an elder may deliver 
the sermonette, offer the prayer, and give the blessing. (See Notes, #1, p. 
179.)
</p>
            
<p><b>To Foster Tithing</b>: By faithfully returning tithe, elders do much to 
encourage other members to return a faithful tithe. (See pp. 142-143, 175.) 
Elders can foster tithing by public presentation of the scriptural privilege and 
responsibility of stewardship and by personal labor with members in a tactful 
and helpful manner.
</p>
            
<p>Elders should regard all financial matters pertaining to members as 
confidential and shall not give such information to unauthorized persons.
</p>
            
<p><b>To Foster Bible Study, Prayer, Nurture, and Spiritual Growth of 
Members</b>: As spiritual leaders, elders are responsible for encouraging 
members to develop a personal relationship with Jesus by strengthening their 
habits of personal Bible study and prayer. Elders should model a commitment 
to Bible study and prayer and should support all ministries and promote 
programs of the local church and the local conference. They should also be 
committed to nurture and to inspire the spiritual growth of church members. 
Elders may ask the board to appoint a council to assist in this role of 
development and encouragement.
</p>
            
<p><b>To Foster All Lines of Work</b>: Under and in cooperation with the 
pastor, elders are spiritual leaders of the church and are responsible for 
fostering all departments and activities of the work. Elders should maintain a 
mutually helpful relationship with other officers.
</p>
            
<p><b>To Cooperate With the Conference</b>: The pastor, elders, and all 
officers should cooperate with conference officers and departmental directors 
in carrying out approved plans. They should inform the church of all regular 
and special offerings, promote all the programs and activities of the church, 
and encourage all officers to support conference plans and policies.
</p>
            
<p>Elders should work closely with the treasurer and see that all conference 
funds are remitted promptly to the conference treasurer at the time established 
by the conference. Elders should see that the clerk’s report is sent promptly 
to the conference secretary at the close of each quarter.
Elders should regard all correspondence from the conference office as
important. Letters calling for announcements should be presented at the 
proper time.
</p>
            
<p>In the absence of the pastor, the first elder (see p. 120-121) should see 
that the church elects delegates to conference sessions and that the clerk sends 
the names of delegates to the conference office.
</p>
            
<p><b>To Foster Worldwide Work</b>: Elders also should foster world mission 
work by carefully studying the worldwide work and encouraging members to 
personally support mission work. Their kindly, tactful attitude will encourage 
liberality of members both in church services and Sabbath School.
</p>
            
<p><b>Training and Equipping of Elders</b>: The Ministerial Association, in 
cooperation with the departments, promotes the training and equipping of 
elders. However, the pastor has the primary responsibility for training elders. 
(See Notes, #2, p. 179.)
</p>
            
<p><b>Free to Work Effectively</b>: Elders especially should be left free of other 
burdens to perform effectively their many duties. It may be advisable in some 
cases to ask elders to lead the outreach (missionary) work of the church, but 
even this should be avoided if other talent is available.
</p>
            
<p><b>First Elder</b>: It may be advisable, because of church size, to choose 
more than one elder because the burdens of the office are too great for one 
person. If the church elects more than one elder, one should be designated 
“first elder.” The work should be divided among the elders in harmony with 
their experience and ability.
</p>
            
<p><b>Limitation of Authority</b>: Elders do not have the authority to receive 
or remove members. This is done only by vote of the church. Only the board 
may recommend that the church vote to receive or remove members. (See pp. 
54, 57-61.)

<h2>Church Leaders</h2>
<p>Occasionally no one possesses the experience and qualifications to serve 
as an elder. Under such circumstances the church should elect a person to be 
known as “leader.” In the absence of the pastor or a conference-assigned 
pastor, the leader is responsible for the services of the church, including 
business meetings. The leader must either conduct the church service or 
arrange for someone else to do so. If the church leader is unable to lead out 
in the business meeting, the conference should be contacted for assistance.</p>
            
<p>A leader, who is not an ordained elder, may not administer baptism, 
conduct the Lord’s Supper, perform the marriage ceremony, or preside at 
business meetings when members are disciplined. A request should be made 
to the conference president for an ordained pastor to preside at such meetings.

<h2>Deacons</h2>
<p>The New Testament identifies the office of deacon with the Greek word 
diakonos, from which the English “deacon” is derived. The Greek word is 
variously interpreted as “servant, minister, writer, attendant” and in Christian 
circles has acquired the specialized meaning now attached to “deacon.”
</p>
            
<p>The men who came to be known as the seven deacons of the apostolic 
church were chosen and ordained to attend to the business of the church. (See 
Acts 6:1-8.) Their qualifications, slightly less exacting than those of elders, 
are listed in 1 Timothy 3:8-13.</p>
            
<blockquote>
“The fact that these brethren had been ordained for the special work of 
looking after the needs of the poor did not exclude them from teaching the 
faith. On the contrary, they were fully qualified to instruct others in the truth, 
and they engaged in the work with great earnestness and success.”— AA 90.
</blockquote>
            
<p>“The appointment of the seven to take the oversight of special lines of 
work proved a great blessing to the church. These officers gave careful 
consideration to individual needs as well as to the general financial interests 
of the church, and by their prudent management and their godly example they
were an important aid to their fellow officers in binding together the various 
interests of the church into a united whole.”—AA 89.</p>
            
            
<p>Today appointment of deacons through election brings similar blessings 
in church administration by relieving pastors, elders, and other officers of 
duties that deacons may perform well.</p>
            
<p>“The time and strength of those who in the providence of God have been 
placed in leading positions of responsibility in the church should be spent in 
dealing with the weightier matters demanding special wisdom and largeness 
of heart. It is not in the order of God that such men should be appealed to for 
the adjustment of minor matters that others are well qualified to handle.”—
AA 93.</p>
            
<p>The Ministerial Association, in connection with the departments, 
promotes the training and equipping of deacons. However, the pastor, in 
conjunction with the elder(s), has the primary responsibility for training the 
deacons. (See Notes, #3, p. 179.)</p>
            
<p><b>Board of Deacons</b><br>Where a church has a number of deacons, it should 
organize a board of deacons chaired by the head deacon and with another 
deacon serving as secretary. Such a body provides a way to distribute 
responsibility and coordinate their contributions to the well-being of the 
congregation. It also provides a training ground where new deacons are 
instructed in their duties.</p>
            
<p><b>Deacons Must Be Ordained</b><br>Newly elected deacons cannot fill their 
office until they have been ordained by an ordained pastor currently 
credentialed by the conference.</p>
            
<p>The sacred rite of ordination should be characterized by simplicity and 
performed in the presence of the church. The pastor may give a brief outline 
of the biblical office of deacon, the qualities required for service, and the 
principal duties deacons are authorized to perform. After a short exhortation 
to faithfulness in service, the pastor, assisted by an elder where appropriate, 
ordains the deacons by prayer and the laying on of hands. (See p. 37-38.)</p>
            
<p>If they retain church membership, deacons, once ordained, do not have 
to be ordained again if they move their memberships to other churches. When 
the term for which they were elected expires, they must be elected to a new 
term of office if they are to continue to serve as deacons.
Elders subsequently elected as deacons need not be ordained as deacons 
because ordination as elder covers this office.</p>
            
<p><b>Deacons Not Authorized to Preside</b><br> Deacons are not authorized to 
preside at the Lord’s Supper, baptism, or business meetings and are not 
permitted to perform the marriage ceremony or officiate at the reception or 
transfer of members.</p>
            
<p>If a church has no one authorized to perform such duties, the church 
leader shall contact the conference for assistance.</p>
<p><b>Duties of Deacons</b>: <br>The work of deacons involves a wide range of 
services for the church, including:</p>
<ul>
            <li><b>Assistance at Services and Meetings</b>: Deacons are usually 
responsible for welcoming members and visitors as they enter the church and 
for assisting them, where necessary, to find seats. They also cooperate with 
the pastor and elders for smooth functioning of all meetings.</li>
            <li><b>Visitation of Members</b>: In many churches, visitation is arranged by 
distributing membership by districts and assigning a deacon to each district 
with the expectation that he will visit each home at least once a quarter.
Deacons should also assist members with special needs. It is important 
to learn how to effectively communicate with them and where needed church 
facilities and transportation should be made accessible. When those with 
special needs are not able to attend services, they should be visited in their 
homes.</li>
            <li><b>Preparation for Baptismal Services</b>: Deacons make necessary 
preparations for baptismal services. (See p. 54.)</li>
            <li><b>Assistance at Communion Service</b>: At the service of foot-washing, 
the deacons or deaconesses provide everything needed, such as towels, 
basins, water, and buckets. After the service they see that the utensils and 
linen are washed and properly stored.<br>
Remaining bread and wine should not be consumed, but disposed of in a 
respectful manner by deacons and deaconesses following the Lord’s Supper.</li>
            <li><b>Care of the Sick and Aiding the Poor and Unfortunate</b>: Deacons and 
deaconesses are charged with assisting the sick, poor, and unfortunate and 
should keep the church informed of their needs and enlist the support of 
members. Money should be provided for this work from the fund for the poor 
and needy. The treasurer, on recommendation from the board, will pass over 
to the deacons or deaconesses whatever may be needed for use in needy cases.</li>
            <li><b>Care and Maintenance of Property</b>In churches where the 
responsibility for the care and maintenance of church property is not assigned 
to a building committee, deacons and deaconesses have this responsibility.

<h2>Deaconesses</h2>
<p>Deaconesses were included in the official staff of the early Christian 
churches.</p>
            
<p>“I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church 
[deaconess] in Cenchrea, that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner 
worthy of the saints, and assist her in whatever business she has need of you; 
for indeed she has been a helper of many and of myself also” (Rom. 16:1, 2).
Deaconesses should be chosen for their consecration and other 
qualifications that fit them for the duties of the office.</p>
            
<p>The Ministerial Association, in connection with the departments, 
promotes the training and equipping of deaconesses. However, the pastor, in 
conjunction with the elder(s), has the primary responsibility for training the 
deaconesses. (See Notes, #3, p. 179.)</p>
            
<p><b>Board of Deaconesses</b><br>If a church elects several deaconesses, it 
should organize a board of deaconesses chaired by the head deaconess and 
another deaconess serving as secretary. This board is authorized to assign 
duties to individual deaconesses and cooperates closely with the board of 
deacons, especially in welcoming members and visitors and in home 
visitation. (See p. 83.) It also provides a training ground where new 
deaconesses are instructed in their duties.</p>
            
<p><b>Ordination Service for Deaconesses</b><br>Such a service, like the 
ordination of deacons, would be carried out by an ordained pastor currently 
credentialed by the conference. The ordination service should be 
characterized by simplicity and performed in the presence of the church.
If they retain church membership, deaconesses do not have to be 
ordained again if they move their memberships to other churches. When the 
term for which they were elected expires, they must be elected to a new term 
of office if they are to continue to serve as deaconesses.</p>
            
<p>Elders subsequently elected as deaconesses should not be ordained as 
deaconesses because ordination as elder covers this office.</p>
<p><b>Deaconesses Not Authorized to Preside</b><br>Deaconesses are not 
authorized to preside at any of the services of the church or business meetings 
and cannot perform the marriage ceremony or officiate at the reception or 
transfer of members.</p>
            
<p>If a church has no one authorized to perform such duties, the church 
leader shall contact the conference for assistance.</p>
            
<p><b>Duties of Deaconesses</b><br>Deaconesses serve the church in a wide 
variety of activities, including:</p>
<ul>
            <li><b>Greeting and Visiting Guests and Members</b><br>In many churches, 
deaconesses assist in greeting guests and members at meetings and in visiting 
members in their homes when they cannot attend services.</li>
<li><b>Visitation of Members</b><br>In many churches, visitation is arranged by 
distributing membership by districts and assigning a deaconess to each 
district with the expectation that she will visit each home at least once a 
quarter.<br>
Deaconesses should also assist members with special needs. It is 
important to learn how to effectively communicate with them and where 
needed church facilities and transportation should be made accessible. When 
those with special needs are not able to attend services, they should be visited 
in their homes.</li>
            <li><b>Assistance at Baptisms</b><br>Deaconesses ensure that female candidates 
are cared for both before and after the ceremony. They also give such counsel 
and help as may be necessary regarding suitable garments for baptism. Robes 
of suitable material should be provided. Where robes are used, the 
deaconesses should see that they are laundered and carefully stored. (See p. 
54.)</li>
            <li><b>Arrangements for the Communion Service</b><br>Deaconesses and 
deacons arrange for everything needed for this service and see that everything 
used is cared for afterward. (See pp. 131-132.)<br>
Before the communion service begins, deaconesses set the communion 
table, including preparing the bread and wine, pouring the wine, placing the
plates of unleavened bread, and covering the table with the linen provided for 
that purpose.<br>
            Deaconesses assist in the service of foot-washing, giving special aid to 
women visitors and new members.</li>
            <li><b>The Care of the Sick and the Poor</b><br>Deaconesses assist deacons in 
caring for the sick, needy, and unfortunate. (See p. 84.)</li>
            <li><b>Care and Maintenance of Property</b><br>In churches where the 
responsibility for the care and maintenance of church property is not assigned 
to a building committee, deacons and deaconesses have this responsibility.

<h2>Clerk</h2>
<p>Much of the efficient functioning of the church depends on the work of 
the clerk. Because of the important and specialized functions of this office, it 
is wise to choose one who can be elected to a new term of office to provide 
continuity in record keeping and reporting. Large churches may elect 
assistant clerks as needed. When the clerk, as secretary, cannot attend a 
business meeting, the clerk should arrange for an assistant to be present to 
take the minutes. (See Notes, #5, p. 180.)</p>
            
<p><b>No Names Added or Removed Without Vote</b><br>The clerk has no 
authority to add names to or remove names from the membership record 
without a vote of the church, which must always vote to add or remove a 
name, except in the case of the death of a member, or when a member requests 
in writing to be removed from membership. When a member dies, the clerk 
will record the date of the death in the membership record. (See p. 61.)
When a member submits a written request to the church board to be 
removed from membership, the clerk will record the action of the board. (See 
p. 72.)</p>
            
<p><b>Transferring Members</b><br>The clerk handles correspondence between 
members and churches in the transferring of memberships. (See pp. 57-61.)</p>
            
<p><b>Corresponding With Members</b><br>The clerk should try to keep in touch 
with absent members. (See Notes, #6, p. 180.)</p>
            
<p><b>Notice of Delegates for Conference Sessions</b><br>The clerk, on 
authorization of the board, promptly notifies the conference of delegates 
elected to represent the church at a conference session, using blanks or forms 
provided by the conference. (See pp. 120-121.)</p>
            
<p><b>Reports to Be Furnished Promptly</b><br>The clerk must promptly furnish 
reports requested by the conference. Some are quarterly, others annual. It is 
essential that reports be sent to the conference secretary within the time 
specified because they are important for the accuracy of reports prepared by 
other organizations of the world Church. The clerk collects information for 
these reports from the other officers and department leaders.</p>
            
<p><b>Church Records</b><br>The clerk keeps church records, which should be 
carefully preserved. All records and account books of all officers are the
property of the church and are to be surrendered to the newly elected clerk at 
the expiration of the term of office of the previous clerk, or to the church at 
any time during the term on request of the pastor or elders. Church records, 
within the privacy limitations of local law, are subject to review by the next 
higher organization. (See p. 61.)

<h2>Treasurer</h2>
<p>Because of the important functions of the treasurer, it is wise to choose 
one who can be elected to a new term of office to provide continuity in record 
keeping and reporting. Large churches may elect assistant treasurers as 
needed.</p>
            
<p>The treasurer can greatly encourage faithfulness in the returning of tithe 
and deepen the spirit of liberality on the part of the members. A word of 
counsel given in the spirit of the Master will help members to render faithfully 
to God His own in tithes and offerings, even in a time of financial stringency.</p>
            
<p><b>Treasurer the Custodian of All Funds</b><br>The treasurer is the custodian 
of all church funds. These include:
<ol>
            <li>conference funds</li>
            <li>local church funds, and</li>
            <li>funds belonging to auxiliary organizations of the local church.</li>
</ol>
            
<p>All funds (conference, local church, and local church auxiliary) are 
deposited by the treasurer in a bank or financial institution account in the 
name of the church, unless the local conference authorizes another system.
Surplus church funds may be deposited in savings accounts upon 
authorization of the board. Where large balances are carried for building or 
special projects, the board may authorize separate bank accounts. Such 
accounts, however, shall be operated by the treasurer and reported to the 
church along with all other church funds.</p>
            
<p>All church bank accounts are exclusively for church funds and are never 
to be combined with any personal account or funds.</p>
            
<p><b>Conference Funds</b><br>Conference funds, which include tithe, all regular 
mission funds, and all funds for special conference projects and institutions, 
are trust funds. At the close of each month, or more often if requested by the 
conference, the treasurer shall send to the conference treasurer the entire 
amount of conference funds received during that period of time. The church 
may not borrow, use, or withhold such conference funds for any purpose.</p>
            
<p><b>Sabbath School Funds</b><br>All Sabbath School offerings are to be passed 
over weekly to the treasurer by the Sabbath School secretary-treasurer, the
treasurer keeping a careful record of all such offerings. These mission funds 
are transmitted to the conference office as outlined in the previous paragraph. 
Sabbath School expense funds are held in trust, subject to the orders of the 
Sabbath School council (See pp. 103-104.), to meet the routine expenses of 
the Sabbath School.</p>
            
<p><b>Local Church Funds</b><br>Local church funds include church expense, 
building and repair funds, and the fund for the poor and needy. These funds 
belong to the local church and are disbursed by the treasurer only by 
authorization of the board or business meeting. However, the treasurer shall 
pay from the expense funds all bills for local expense that have been 
authorized by the board.</p>
            
<p><b>Funds of Auxiliary Organizations</b><br>Auxiliary organization funds 
include such funds as church outreach programs, family life, Adventist Youth 
Ministries, Adventist Community Services or Dorcas Society, Sabbath 
School expense, and that portion of the health ministries funds belonging to 
the church, and may include church school funds. All money received by and 
for these organizations is turned over promptly to the church treasurer by the 
secretary of the organization, the deacons, or whoever has received the funds. 
These funds belong to the auxiliary organizations of the church. They may be 
disbursed only by order of the auxiliary organization to which they belong.
The treasurer shall give receipts for all funds received. On receiving 
money from the treasurer, the secretary of the auxiliary organization shall 
give a proper receipt to the treasurer.</p>
            
<p><b>Safeguarding the Purpose of Funds</b><br>When an offering is taken for 
worldwide missions or for any general or local enterprise, all money placed 
in the offering plate (unless otherwise indicated by the donor) shall be 
counted as part of that particular offering. All offerings and gifts contributed 
by individuals for a specific fund or purpose must be used for that purpose. 
Neither the treasurer nor the board has the authority to divert any funds from 
the objective for which they were given.</p>
            
<p>The funds of auxiliary organizations, often donations given for specific 
purposes, are raised for that special part of the church’s work for which the 
auxiliary organization is established. Such funds are held in trust by the 
treasurer, and they too may not be borrowed or in any way diverted by the 
treasurer or the board from the objective for which they were raised.
When an auxiliary organization is discontinued, the church in a regular 
business meeting may take action indicating the disposition of any balance of 
funds in the account of the organization.</p>
            
<p><b>Money for Personal Literature Orders</b><br>Money for personal orders 
of literature, books, pamphlets, magazines, and subscriptions for periodicals 
is cared for by the treasurer in areas where a local Adventist Book Center 
does not exist. (See Notes, #7, p. 180.)</p>
            
<p><b>Proper Method for Payment of Money by Members</b><br>The treasurer 
should urge that all money paid in by members, other than the regular church 
collection, be placed in tithe and offering envelopes, unless an alternative 
method approved by the conference, such as electronic payments, has been 
implemented. Members should list the various items and amounts on the 
envelope as indicated and to make sure that the money enclosed equals the 
total shown. They should also sign their names and give their addresses, and 
place the envelopes in the offering plate or hand them to the treasurer, who 
should preserve the envelopes to serve as vouchers until all accounts are 
checked by the conference auditor.</p>
            
<p>Members who return their tithes and offerings by check or postal notes 
should, where legally possible, make such checks or notes payable to the 
church, rather than to any individual.</p>
            
<p><b>Receipts to Members</b><br>Receipts should be issued promptly for all 
money received from members, no matter how small the amount, and a strict 
account of all receipts and payments should be kept by the treasurer. All 
general offerings not in envelopes should be counted by the treasurer in the 
presence of another officer, preferably a deacon or deaconess, and a receipt 
given to such officer.</p>
            
<p><b>Proper Method of Remitting Funds to the Conference</b><br>In sending 
remittances to the conference treasurer, all checks, bank drafts, or money 
orders should be made payable to the organization wherever legally possible 
and not to any individual. A copy of the treasurer’s records for the period
should be enclosed with the remittance. Remittance blanks are furnished by 
the conference. (See pp. 142-143.)</p>
            
<p><b>Preservation of Financial Documents</b><br>Financial documents, 
vouchers, or receipted bills should be secured for all funds received and 
disbursed in accordance with the system authorized by the local conference.</p>
            
<p><b>Books Should Be Audited</b><br>The conference treasurer, or other 
individual appointed by the conference executive committee, audits the 
church financial records, usually each year.</p>
            
<p>The treasurer’s books and other financial records relating to the work of 
the treasurer, the church school treasurer, and the treasurer of any other 
organization may be called for and inspected at any time by the conference 
auditor or by the pastor, district leader, first elder, or by any others authorized 
by the church board, but should not be made available to unauthorized 
persons. (See p. 147.)</p>
            
<p>Reports of all funds received and disbursed should be presented at the 
regular business meetings of the church. A copy of these reports should be 
given to the leading officers.</p>
            
<p>When the number of individuals returning tithe in the church is reported, 
the spouse and minor children who are non-wage earners but members of the 
church should be counted in this group, in addition to the wage earner of the 
family.</p>
            
<p><b>Relations With Members Confidential</b><br>The treasurer should always 
remember that relations with individual members are strictly confidential. 
The treasurer should never comment on the tithe returned by any member or 
on the income or anything concerning it, except to those who share the 
responsibility of the work. Great harm may be caused by failure to observe 
this rule.</p>

<h2>Interest Coordinator</h2>
<p>An interest coordinator should be elected to make sure that interests 
developed through the church’s missionary outreach are cared for promptly. 
This person is a member of the board and the personal ministries council and 
works directly with the pastor and chairperson of that council.
Duties of this office include:</p>
<ol>
            <li>Keeping an organized list of all interests received by the church.</li>
            <li>Assisting the pastor and chairperson of the personal ministries council in enlisting and recruiting qualified members for follow-up service.</li>
            <li>Presenting to the board a monthly report on the number of interests received and followed up. When an interest is sufficiently developed, it should be shared with the pastor.</li>

<h2>Departments and Other Organizations</h2>
<p>Church structure, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, is vital for the 
spiritual growth of members and for the fulfillment of the Church’s mission. 
It is the skeleton of the ecclesiastical body. And “the whole body, joined and 
knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working 
by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying 
of itself in love” (Eph. 4:16).</p>
            
<p>The most important elements of structure and organization are the 
officers (See pp. 77-91.) and the departments and other organizations. This 
section describes their objectives, leadership, and functions.
The work of the departments and auxiliary organizations is closely tied 
to the work of the pastor because all are equally engaged in gospel outreach. 
The pastor serves as a counselor to these organizations, and they in turn assist 
in the overall church outreach programs. In case of emergency, or where 
circumstances require, the pastor may call a meeting of any committee or 
organization.</p>
            
<p>Every church should utilize the services of the departments and 
organizations to nurture its members and accomplish the mission given by 
Christ (see Matt. 28:19; Rev. 10:11; 14:6).</p>

<h2>Adventist Possibility Ministries</h2>
<p>The Adventist Possibility Ministries initiative was established to extend 
the compassionate and inclusive ministry of Jesus and seeks to inspire, equip, 
and mobilize those with special needs and those who are deaf. These 
opportunities are defined as deafness, blindness, physical mobility 
limitations, and mental/social development. It also includes ministry for 
orphans and vulnerable children, widows and widowers, and caregivers. The 
goal is to foster understanding with the exploration of ministry possibilities 
for those with special needs and the Deaf.</p>
            
<p>All are in search of wholeness. All are gifted, needed, and treasured. All 
are created in the image of God with an inherent dignity regardless of any 
limitation they may have. This global initiative encompasses a ministry for 
those with special needs and the Deaf, along with seeking opportunities to 
minister with them. While some disadvantages may be present, greater 
emphasis is placed upon their possibilities. This educational mission of the 
Church strategically gives focus to three main values: awareness of needs; 
acceptance of the individuals who are deaf or who have special needs; and 
the development of specific action plans to be implemented to provide 
opportunities for these individuals to find purpose and fulfillment in life and 
ministry.</p>
            
<p>The following statement by Ellen G. White underscores the importance 
of this work, “I saw that it is in the providence of God that widows and 
orphans, the blind, the Deaf, the lame, and persons afflicted in a variety of 
ways, have been placed in close Christian relationship to His church; it is to 
prove His people and develop their true character. Angels of God are 
watching to see how we treat these persons who need our sympathy, love, 
and disinterested benevolence. This is God’s test of our character.”—3T 511.</p>
            
<p><b>The Deaf as a Unique Culture</b><br>The Deaf are internationally 
recognized as having their own set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, history, 
literary traditions, values, and languages just as other cultures. While they are 
often considered as having “special needs,” the Church recognizes their 
deafness as more of a cultural characteristic than of a disability.</p>
            
<p><b>Adventist Possibility Ministries Leader</b><br>It is recommended that the 
board appoint a local possibility ministries leader. While it is preferable for 
the leader to have direct experience or education with possibility ministries, 
it is not mandatory. It is best if the leadership for this ministry is chosen from 
within the groups they represent. While working together with other leaders, 
it is critical that planning be done by the groups themselves. This is done so 
they may serve God and community as expressed in the mission statement of 
the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It is imperative for the leader to be 
compassionate, and to serve with an approach that fosters empowerment and 
participation.</p>
            
<p><b>Adventist Possibility Ministries Committee</b><br>The church board 
should establish a committee for possibility ministries to encourage members 
with special needs and to learn how to effectively communicate with them. It 
should create witnessing programs, recommend how to make church facilities 
more accessible, help solve transportation problems, and recommend ways to 
assist in the discovery of roles or ministries that bring a sense of meaning and 
fulfillment. The committee is chaired by the possibility ministries leader(s). 
If not serving as the chairperson, the pastor should be an ex officio member.</p>

<h2>Children’s Ministries</h2>
<p>Children’s ministries develops the faith of children from birth through 
age 14, leading them into union with the Church. It seeks to provide multiple 
ministries that will lead children to Jesus and disciple them in their daily walk 
with Him. It cooperates with the Sabbath School and other departments to 
provide religious education to children and fulfills its mission by developing 
a variety of grace-oriented ministries for children that are inclusive, serviceoriented, leadership-building, safe, and evangelistic.
“Too much importance cannot be placed on the early training of children. 
The lessons that the child learns during the first seven years of life have more 
to do with forming his character than all that it learns in future years.”—CG 
193.</p>
            
<p>“It is still true that children are the most susceptible to the teachings of 
the gospel; their hearts are open to divine influences, and strong to retain the 
lessons received. The little children may be Christians, having an experience 
in accordance with their years. They need to be educated in spiritual things, 
and parents should give them every advantage, that they may form characters 
after the similitude of the character of Christ.”—DA 515.</p>
            
<p>“Children of eight, ten, or twelve years are old enough to be addressed 
on the subject of personal religion. . . . If properly instructed, very young 
children may have correct views of their state as sinners and of the way of 
salvation through Christ.”—1T 400.</p>
            
<p>“When Jesus told the disciples not to forbid the children to come to Him, 
He was speaking to His followers in all ages—to officers of the church, to 
ministers, helpers, and all Christians. Jesus is drawing the children, and He 
bids us, Suffer them to come; as if He would say, They will come if you do 
not hinder them.”—DA 517.</p>
            
<p><b>Children’s Ministries Coordinator and Committee</b><br>The church 
elects a children’s ministries coordinator to develop ministries that nurture 
the faith of children. The coordinator should have leadership ability as well 
as experience and passion for working with children.</p>
            
<p>The children’s ministries coordinator works with the pastor and board to 
establish a children’s ministries committee to provide ministries for children. 
The committee should consist of individuals with interest and experience in 
working with children. Ordinarily the members include Sabbath School
division leaders, Vacation Bible School leader, Junior Youth Ministries 
leaders, and two to three others who have a passion for ministry to children.</p>
            
<p>If the church has a children’s ministries department, Vacation Bible
Schools, children’s branch Sabbath Schools, Neighborhood Bible Clubs, and 
Story Hours, they will come under the direction of children’s ministries. 
Everyone involved in work with children must meet Church and legal 
standards and requirements, such as background checks or certification. 
Local church leaders should consult with the conference, which will ascertain 
and advise as to what background checks and certifications are available 
and/or required. (See Notes, #8, pp. 180-181.)</p>

                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>Communication ministry calls for the support of every layperson, 
Church employee, and Church institution. The communication department 
promotes the use of a sound program of public relations and all contemporary 
communication techniques, sustainable technologies, and media in the 
promulgation of the gospel. The church should elect a communication 
secretary and, where needed, a communication committee.</p>
            
<p>“We must take every justifiable means of bringing the light before the 
people. Let the press be utilized, and let every advertising agency be 
employed that will call attention to the work.”—6T 36.
“Means will be devised to reach hearts. Some of the methods used in this 
work will be different from the methods used in the work in the past.”—Ev 
105.</p>
            
<p>Communication Secretary</b><br>The communication secretary should 
have the ability to meet people and rightly represent the Church, sound 
judgment, good organization, effective writing skills, and a willingness to 
carry out assignments.</p>
            
<p>The secretary gathers and disseminates news to local media, cooperates 
with the conference communication director, and presents periodic reports to 
the business meeting. The conference communication department provides 
appropriate instruction and help to communication secretaries.
The pastor, who is primarily responsible for the communication program 
of the church, will work closely in an advisory capacity with the 
communication secretary or committee.</p>
            
<p>Any department or organization may appoint an individual to provide 
the communication secretary or committee with information about 
newsworthy events.</p>
            
<p>Communication Committee</b><br>In a large church a communication 
committee may more adequately handle the many facets of the public 
relations and communication program. The church elects the committee, and 
the communication secretary serves as chairperson. Members of the 
committee may be assigned specific communication responsibilities, such as 
working with the press, media producers and online personnel, and internal 
church media. If there is a nearby Church institution, a member of its public 
relations or communication staff should be invited to sit with the committee.</p>
            
<p>Central Communication Committee—If several churches in an area 
arrange for a central communication committee, the communication secretary 
of each church should be a member and should work in harmony with any 
general plan that will better coordinate the handling of news and other media 
activities for the cooperating churches. The establishment of this committee 
would be initiated by the conference communication director. Meetings of 
the central committee would be called and presided over by a chairperson 
selected by the group.

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>Church entities operate schools from kindergarten through university 
levels for the purpose of transmitting to students the Church’s ideals, beliefs, 
attitudes, values, habits, and customs. The source, the means, and the aim of 
Adventist education are a true knowledge of God, fellowship and 
companionship with Him in study and service, and likeness to Him in 
character development.</p>
            
<p><b>Education Secretary</b><br>The church elects an education secretary to 
promote and generate support for Christian education. The secretary is a 
member of the Home and School Association executive committee and works 
in cooperation with the association.</p>
            
<p><b>Home and School Association</b><br>A church with a school shall establish 
a Home and School Association, the purpose of which is to provide parent 
education and unite the home, the school, and the church in endeavors to 
provide Christian education for the children. Parents of students, school 
patrons, and church members should be encouraged to be active members of 
the association.</p>
            
<p>Home and School Association officers shall be a leader, assistant leader, 
secretary-treasurer, librarian, and the educational secretary. (See p. 185.) To
give continuity, some of the officers should be elected for second terms. All
shall be members of the church.</p>
            
<p>The leader of the association shall be a member with success in training 
children, whose mind is open to new ideas, and who believes in the 
importance of Christian education.</p>
            
<p>The secretary-treasurer keeps the records of the association and reports 
to the director of the conference education department at the beginning and 
end of each school year. Association funds are channeled through the 
church/school treasurer, kept as a separate account, and audited under 
denominational policy.</p>
            
<p>The principal is an ex officio member of the Home and School
Association committee.</p>
            
<p><b>Church School Board</b><br>The administrative body of every elementary 
(primary) school and junior academy (partial high school) operated by one 
church shall be a church school board elected by the church or a school 
committee appointed by the church board. Thus this body may be a separate 
school board, the church board, or a school committee of the church board 
appointed for this purpose. Division working policies explain the functions 
of school boards.</p>
            
<p>School board members should be chosen for their consecration, their 
belief in and loyalty to the principles of Christian education, their good 
judgment and tact, their experience in school matters, and their financial 
judgment and ability. They should believe in and be willing to follow 
denominational educational policies and recommendations.
If two or more churches jointly operate what is known as a 
multiconstituent school, the administrative body shall be drawn from the 
constituent churches.</p>
            
<p>One or more members of the school board should be chosen from among 
the members of the church board, so that the school board may be closely 
related to the church board.</p>
            
<p>The pastor should be a member of the school board. If the school is 
operated by more than one church, generally the pastors of the participating 
churches concerned are members of the board.</p>
            
<p>In junior academies and elementary schools, the principal or head teacher 
should be a member of the board.</p>
            
<p>Some members of the board may be parents of children attending the 
school, so the board may profit from parental viewpoints and counsel 
resulting from close observation and experience.</p>
            
<p>The school board officers shall be a chairperson and a secretary. If the 
school is operated by one church, the church elects the chairperson.
In multiconstituent school boards, additional officers shall include a 
treasurer, a vice chairperson, and an assistant secretary. At its first meeting 
after its election, a multiconstituent school board elects its own chairperson 
from among its members. In the event that agreement between the churches
is not possible, the appointment will be made by the conference board of 
education or the conference executive committee. The principal of the school 
generally is appointed secretary of the board.</p>
            
<p>Any action of a multiconstituent school board that involves the 
supporting churches in financial obligations must be submitted to their 
respective boards for approval.</p>
            
<p>Where a separate school board is elected, one of two plans may be 
followed to establish time of election and term of office: (1) all the members 
may be elected at the close of the calendar or fiscal year and function for one 
year; (2) the members of the first board may be chosen for terms of one, two, 
and three years, respectively, with replacement members being chosen each 
succeeding year for a term of three years. The purpose of this plan is to have 
a nucleus of experienced members on the board to ensure a continuity of 
policy. When a midterm vacancy is filled, the new member serves the 
remainder of the original term.</p>
            
<p>The school board or school committee should meet at a regular time and 
place at least once each month during the school year.</p>
            
<p>The school board chairperson calls meetings, presides, sees that the 
actions of the board are carried out, and countersigns all financial orders 
issued by the secretary. The chairperson is a member ex officio of the 
elementary school and junior academy inspection committee, which surveys 
and evaluates the school and its work.</p>
            
<p>The secretary keeps a permanent record of meetings, issues orders for 
money to pay accounts or obligations, and carries on correspondence for the 
board.</p>
            
<p>Where one church operates a school, the work of the treasurer is usually 
carried by the church treasurer or an assistant church treasurer, who receives 
tuition and other money, pays out money on the order of the secretary 
(countersigned by the chairperson), keeps a careful account of all transfers, 
and at each monthly meeting gives a detailed report to the board. In a 
multiconstituent board, a treasurer is appointed by the union board.

<h2>Family Ministries</h2>
<p>The objective of family ministries is to strengthen marriage and the 
family. The family was established by divine creation with marriage at its 
center.</p>
            
<p>As the primary setting in which values are learned and the capacity for 
close relationships with God and others is developed, its health is vital to the 
Church’s disciple-making mission.</p>
            
<p>Family ministries upholds the biblical teaching related to the family and 
lifts up God’s ideals for family living. At the same time, it brings an 
understanding of the brokenness experienced by individuals and families in 
a fallen world. The department facilitates understanding, unity, and love at 
home and in the family of God. It fosters reconciliation between the 
generations promised in the Elijah message of Malachi 4:5, 6 and extends 
hope and support to those who have been hurt by abuse, family dysfunction, 
and broken relationships. Relational growth opportunities are provided 
through family life education and enrichment. Individuals, married couples, 
and families are helped to avail themselves of professional counseling when 
necessary.</p>
            
<p>Ministry to families in the local church focuses on premarital guidance 
for couples, marriage strengthening programs, and the education of parents. 
Ministry to families also gives attention to the special needs of single parents 
and stepfamilies and provides instruction in family-to-family evangelism.</p>
            
<p>“Our work for Christ is to begin with the family, in the home. . . . There 
is no missionary field more important than this. . . . By many this home field 
has been shamefully neglected, and it is time that divine resources and 
remedies were presented, that this state of evil may be corrected.”— AH 35.
“God designs that the families of earth shall be a symbol of the family in 
heaven. Christian homes, established and conducted in accordance with 
God’s plan, are among His most effective agencies for the formation of 
Christian character and for the advancement of His work.”—6T 430.
“The mission of the home extends beyond its own members. . . . Far more 
powerful than any sermon that can be preached is the influence of a true home 
upon human hearts and lives.”—MH 352.</p>
            
<p><b>Family Ministries Leader(s)</b><br>An individual or married couple (See 
pp. 160-162 for the Church’s definition of marriage.) may be elected to serve 
as family ministries leader(s). They should model strong and growing family 
relationships and exhibit a sincere interest in fostering the well-being of all 
families. In order to be effective, the family ministries leader(s) must have an 
understanding of God’s redemptive plan for dealing with the brokenness in 
relationships that sin has brought. The leader(s) also must maintain 
appropriate confidentiality and know when and how to encourage individuals 
in critical situations to seek professional counseling.</p>
            
<p><b>Family Ministries Committee</b><br>The board may establish a family 
ministries committee chaired by the family ministries leader(s).

<h2>Health Ministries</h2>
<p>The Church believes its responsibility to make Christ known to the world 
includes a moral obligation to preserve human dignity by promoting optimal 
levels of physical, mental, and spiritual health.</p>
            
<p>In addition to ministering to those who are ill, this responsibility extends 
to the prevention of disease through effective health education and leadership 
in promoting optimum health, free of tobacco, alcohol, other drugs, and 
unclean foods. Where possible, members shall be encouraged to follow a 
primarily vegetarian diet.</p>
            
<p><b>Health Ministries Leader</b><br>For planning and implementing an 
efficient program, the church elects a health ministries leader and, if needed, 
an associate leader. The leader should be health-oriented and interested in 
promoting the Church’s standards in healthful living among members and in 
the community through church-operated health ministries programs. The 
leader should be able to screen programs and information that are 
representative of the ideals and philosophy of the Church and to integrate 
them into an effective spiritual and physical witness.</p>
            
<p><b>Health Ministries Council</b><br>Where practical, a church may appoint a 
health ministries council to provide leadership to both members and 
community in the field of healthful living and to assist in cooperative soulsaving activities through a viable program of health and temperance and 
spiritual emphasis. The council, in collaboration with the personal ministries 
council, shall lead out in developing a schedule of health ministries activities 
that include such programs as stop-smoking plans, cooking schools, health 
classes, stress-control programs, and related endeavors. If not serving as 
chairperson, the pastor should be an ex officio member.</p>
            
<p><b>Health Ministries or Temperance Society</b><br>In some areas a health 
ministries or temperance society may be established as a separate entity 
distinct from Church organizations. The conference health ministries director 
should be involved in establishing such an entity.</p>
            
<p><b>World Health Ministries Sabbath Offering</b><br>The entire World 
Health Ministries Sabbath Offering is sent to the conference to be distributed 
according to policy. Upon the church’s request to the conference, up to 25 
percent of the offering received in the church may revert to the church for 
health ministries programs.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p><b>Selecting Music Coordinators</b><br>
            The church should take great care in selecting music leaders, choosing only those who are thoroughly consecrated 
and provide appropriate music for all church worship services and meetings. 
Secular music or that of a questionable nature should never be introduced into 
our services.</p>
            
<p>Music leaders should work closely with the pastor or elders in order that 
musical selections harmonize with the sermon theme. The music leader is 
under the direction of the pastor or elders and does not work independently. 
The music leader should counsel with them about the music to be rendered 
and the selection of singers and musicians.</p>
            
<p><b>Selecting Musicians</b><br>
            Sacred music is an important part of public worship. The church must exercise care in selecting choir members and other 
musicians who will rightly represent Church principles. They should be 
members of the church, the Sabbath School, or the Adventist Youth
Ministries. Because they occupy a conspicuous place in church services, they 
should be examples of modesty and decorum in their appearance and dress. 
Choir robes are optional.</p>
            
<p>Churches may have multiple choirs. A children’s choir is a means of 
spiritual nurture, bonding to the church family, and outreach.

<h2>Public Affairs and Religious Liberty</h2>
<p>The Public Affairs and Religious Liberty (PARL) department promotes 
and maintains religious liberty, with particular emphasis upon liberty of 
conscience. Religious liberty includes the human right to have or adopt the 
religion of one’s choice, to change religious belief according to conscience, 
to manifest one’s religion individually or in community with fellow believers, 
in worship, observance, practice, witness, and teaching, subject to respect for 
the equivalent rights of others.</p>
            
<p>Religious Liberty Leader—The elected religious liberty leader 
cooperates with both the pastor and the conference or union PARL 
department. The leader should be of positive spiritual influence, able to meet 
the general public, interested in public affairs, proficient as a correspondent, 
and concerned with the preservation of liberty for God’s people.</p>
            
<p>Religious Liberty Associations—Each church is considered an 
informal religious liberty association, and every church member is considered 
a member of the association. The pastor or an elder is the chairperson.

<h2>Publishing Ministries</h2>
<p>Publishing ministries coordinates and promotes literature evangelism 
under supervision of the publishing ministries council and the appropriate 
publishing organization for the territory. It assists other departments in the 
promotion, sale, and distribution of subscription magazines and other 
missionary literature. The department works with the pastor and other 
departments in planning for systematic ways to involve members in 
publishing ministries.</p>
            
<p>“There are many places in which the voice of the minister cannot be 
heard, places which can be reached only by our publications—the books, 
papers, and tracts filled with the Bible truths that the people need.”—CM 4.
The mission of publishing ministries is evangelism and the nurture of 
church members. Ellen G. White encouraged members to “sell or to give 
away our literature.”—CM 91.</p>

<h2>Sabbath School and Personal Ministries</h2>
<h3>Sabbath School</h3>
<p>The Sabbath School, the primary religious education program of the 
Church, has four purposes: study of the Scripture, fellowship, community 
outreach, and world mission emphasis. The General Conference Sabbath 
School and Personal Ministries Department distributes the Sabbath School
Bible study guide for all age levels, provides designs for Sabbath School
programming within the context of the various world division cultures, 
provides resources and training systems for Sabbath School teachers, and 
promotes world mission Sabbath School offerings.</p>
            
<p>“The Sabbath school is an important branch of the missionary work, not 
only because it gives to young and old a knowledge of God’s Word, but 
because it awakens in them a love for its sacred truths, and a desire to study 
them for themselves; above all, it teaches them to regulate their lives by its 
holy teachings.”—CSW 10, 11.</p>
            
<p>“The Sabbath school, if rightly conducted, is one of God’s great 
instrumentalities to bring souls to a knowledge of the truth.”—CSW 115.
Officers of the Sabbath School Council—The church elects Sabbath 
School officers and members of the Sabbath School council. Officers include 
the superintendent and any assistant superintendents; secretary and any 
assistant secretaries; a leader for each division, including adult and extension 
divisions; children’s ministries coordinator and/or Vacation Bible School 
director; and Investment secretary.</p>
            
<p>The officers, teachers, and all Sabbath School members should cooperate 
with other departments in all outreach (missionary) work, as well as carrying 
on Sabbath School evangelism by means of regular Sabbath School classes 
and such activities as Decision Days, pastors’ Bible classes, Community 
Guest Days, Vacation Bible Schools, and branch Sabbath Schools, including 
Neighborhood Bible Clubs and Story Hours.</p>
            
<p>The Sabbath School council is the administrative body of the Sabbath 
School. It consists of the superintendent (who serves as chairperson), any 
assistant superintendents, secretary (who serves as secretary), any assistant 
secretaries, division leaders, Investment secretary, personal ministries leader, 
children’s ministries coordinator and/or Vacation Bible School director, an 
elder (appointed by the board or by the board of elders), and the pastor.</p>
            
<p>As soon as possible after the officers are elected, the superintendent 
should call a council meeting to appoint, as needed for the various divisions, 
other officers who do not serve as members of the council. These may include 
assistant division leaders, division secretaries, music directors, pianists 
and/or organists, and greeters.</p>
            
<p>In addition to the appointed officers listed above, the council studies the 
need of all divisions and groups and appoints teachers whose names are 
submitted to the board for approval. To maintain both the integrity of the 
Sabbath School lesson curriculum and the quality of teaching, the council 
should exercise great care in choosing teachers. Particularly when selecting 
teachers for the children’s divisions, the council should consult with division 
leaders. All teachers shall be members of the church in regular standing.</p>
            
<p>The council is responsible for the successful operation of the entire 
Sabbath School through the superintendent. The council should meet 
regularly as needed. The council should ensure that program helps and 
materials, including the Sabbath School Bible study guide prepared by the 
General Conference, are supplied in sufficient quantities.</p>
            
<p>Sabbath School Superintendent and Other Sabbath School 
Officers—The superintendent is the leading officer of the Sabbath School
and should begin planning for its smooth and effective operation as soon as 
elected. The superintendent should support the plans and emphases of the 
conference Sabbath School department and should implement decisions of 
the Sabbath School council concerning the operation of the Sabbath School. 
The church may elect one or more assistant superintendents.</p>
            
<p>The secretary should complete the quarterly report on the appropriate 
form immediately after the last Sabbath of the quarter and mail it before the 
deadline to the conference Sabbath School and personal ministries directors. 
The secretary also should place a copy in the secretary’s permanent file, give 
copies to the superintendent and the pastor, and present it at the business 
meeting.</p>
            
<p>The Investment secretary promotes the Investment plan for mission 
support in all Sabbath School divisions and keeps all members informed as 
the program progresses.</p>
            
<p>The Vacation Bible School (VBS) director leads in organizing, 
promoting, and launching community evangelism through the annual VBS. 
The church may assign this responsibility to the children’s ministries 
coordinator.</p>
            
<p>The council may appoint a music director for the Sabbath School in 
consultation with division leaders. As an expression of worship, music should 
glorify God. Singers and other musicians should be as carefully selected as 
are the leaders for other parts of the Sabbath School service and should be 
measured by the same standards. (See pp. 101, 155, 157.) The council also 
may appoint pianists and organists for the divisions.</p>
            
<p>Sabbath School Division Leaders—The church board elects a leader 
for each division. The Sabbath School council may appoint assistant division 
leaders as needed. The Sabbath School Handbook, available from the 
Adventist Book Center or the conference Sabbath School department, 
contains information about all divisions, from beginners through adult and 
the extension division, which cares for those unable to attend Sabbath School.</p>
            
<p>Sabbath School Teachers—The Sabbath School council chooses and 
the church board approves Sabbath School teachers. They should have an 
aptitude for teaching and be willing to study ways to improve their teaching 
abilities. They should be diligent in preparation, regular and punctual in 
attendance, and examples in the daily study of the Sabbath School Bible study 
guide.</p>
            
<p>The council should make special effort to select teachers for children and 
youth who have an interest in those age levels and ability to meet their needs. 
Everyone involved in work with the children’s divisions must meet Church 
and legal standards and requirements, such as background checks or 
certification. Local church leaders should consult with the conference, which 
will ascertain and advise as to what background checks and certifications are 
available and/or required. (See Notes, #8, p. 183.) All teachers should be 
encouraged to participate in the teacher training courses available through the 
conference Sabbath School department.</p>
            
<p>Every Sabbath School should have a weekly teachers’ meeting.
Realizing that “none but those who have fortified the mind with the truths 
of the Bible will stand through the last great conflict” (GC 593, 594), Sabbath 
School leaders should strongly encourage regular systematic study of the 
Word. The Sabbath School Bible study guide is designed to encourage daily 
feasting on the Word, a practice that has done much to maintain unity 
throughout the Church. Every member should have access to the appropriate 
age-level Sabbath School Bible study guide published by the General
Conference and/or division. Similarly, every leader and teacher should have 
access to the helps produced for the various Sabbath School divisions by the 
General Conference and/or division.</p>
            
<p>Teachers should have at least 30 minutes during which to teach their 
classes.</p>
            
<p>Sabbath School Offerings—The Sabbath School secretary should 
accurately record Sabbath School offerings and pass them on to the treasurer 
as soon as possible. Extension division offerings should be added to the 
regular Sabbath School offerings. Many Sabbath Schools take offerings for 
Sabbath School expense. With the exception of that expense fund, all Sabbath 
School offerings are for the support of the mission fields and are to be passed 
on in their entirety by the treasurer to the conference. These funds include the 
regular weekly Sabbath School offering, the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, 
Sabbath School Investment, and Birthday-Thank Offering. Each is to be 
identified as a separate fund in the financial system of the church. Mission 
funds are distributed according to policy. No mission funds may be retained 
by the church or conference.</p>
            
<p>The Sabbath School expense offering and the mission offering, where 
the calendar of offerings is being used, shall not be taken as one offering and 
divided according to an agreed-upon formula or percentage. The offerings 
may be taken as combined offering where the church is operating under a 
division-approved combined offering plan.</p>
            
<p>Resources—For Sabbath School and personal ministries resources, see
Notes, #15, pp. 182-183.</p>
            
<h3>Personal Ministries</h3>
<p>Personal ministries provides resources and trains members to unite their 
efforts with those of the pastor and officers in soul-winning service. It also 
has primary responsibility for programs assisting those in need.</p>
            
<p>Personal Ministries Council—The personal ministries council guides 
the outreach (missionary) efforts of the church and works under the direction 
of the board. The council should meet at least once each month and should
consist of the pastor, an elder, the treasurer, and leaders of the other 
departments and auxiliary services functioning in that congregation. The 
personal ministries council may assign subcommittees for specialized tasks. 
All subcommittees report to the personal ministries council. The personal
ministries council and leader are responsible for organizing small group 
ministries.</p>
            
<p>Personal Ministries Officers—The church elects the personal 
ministries officers, including the leader, assistants (as needed), and the 
secretary.</p>
            
<p>The leader trains and directs members in outreach (missionary) service 
and chairs the personal ministries council. The leader reports in the monthly 
church outreach (missionary) Sabbath service and business meetings about 
total outreach (missionary) activities of the congregation. Assistants may be 
assigned to coordinate the Bible correspondence school, Bible evangelism, 
literature distribution, Ingathering (or equivalent appeals), small group 
ministries, member training, and other soul-winning programs.</p>
            
<p>The secretary serves as representative of the Adventist Book Center for 
all departments of the church and works with the leader in developing the 
outreach (missionary) programs of the church.</p>
            
<p>Adventist Men—Adventist Men is a subsidiary of the personal 
ministries department. It includes lay preaching efforts, prison ministry, and 
Community Services.</p>
            
<p>Bible School Coordinator—The Bible school coordinator organizes 
and coordinates the church’s Bible school outreach ministry to the 
community. The coordinator should work closely with the pastor, the interest 
coordinator, and the personal ministries leader.</p>
            
<p>Adventist Community Services Leader or Dorcas Society Leader—
The church elects the Adventist Community Services leader or Dorcas 
Society leader, assistant leaders (as needed), and secretary-treasurer of 
Adventist Community Services, which in some areas is known as the Dorcas 
Society. (See Notes, #16, p. 183.) This organization gathers and prepares 
clothing, food and other supplies for those in need and works closely with the 
Adventist Men, deacons, deaconesses, and other church departments in 
community outreach. Adventist Community Services or Dorcas Society
ministry, however, includes more than giving material aid. It focuses on 
identifying needs and responding with services based on these specific needs.

<h2>Spirit of Prophecy Writings</h2>
<p>The Scriptures testify that one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. 
This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and we believe it was 
manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Her writings speak with 
prophetic authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction, and 
correction to the Church. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard 
by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Num. 12:6; 2 Chron. 
20:20; Amos 3:7; Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 1:1-3; 
Rev. 12:17; 19:10; 22:8, 9.) </p>

<h2>Stewardship Ministries</h2>
<p>Stewardship ministries encourages members to respond to God’s grace 
by dedicating all they have to Him. Stewardship responsibility involves more 
than just money. It includes, but is not limited to, the proper care and use of 
the body, mind, time, abilities, spiritual gifts, relationships, influence, 
language, the environment, and material possessions. The department assists 
members in their partnership with God in completing His mission through 
the proper utilization of all of His gifts and resources.</p>
            
<p>When the Spirit of God takes possession of the life, “those whose hearts 
are filled with the love of Christ will follow the example of Him who for our 
sake became poor, that through His poverty we might be made rich. Money, 
time, influence—all the gifts they have received from God’s hand, they will 
value only as a means of advancing the work of the gospel.”— AA 71.</p>
            
<p>
            <b>Stewardship Ministries Leader</b> —The stewardship ministries leader 
should practice the principles of Christian stewardship and should have an 
understanding of the spiritual and financial ministry of the Church. The leader 
will work in cooperation with the conference stewardship ministries director, 
the pastor, and the board. The leader acts as a liaison between the conference 
stewardship ministries department and the congregation.</p>

<h2>Women’s Ministries</h2>
<p>Women’s ministries upholds, encourages, and challenges women in their 
daily walk as disciples of Jesus Christ and as members of His church.
Its objectives are to foster spiritual growth and renewal; affirm that 
women are of immeasurable worth by virtue of their creation and redemption, 
equip them for service, and offer women’s perspectives on church issues; 
minister to the broad spectrum of women’s needs, with regard for 
multicultural and multiethnic perspectives; cooperate with other departments 
to facilitate ministry to women and of women; build good will among women 
to encourage mutual support and creative exchange of ideas; mentor and 
encourage women and create paths for their involvement in the church; and 
find ways and means to challenge each woman to use her gifts to further 
global mission.</p>
            
<p>
            <b>Women’s Ministries Leader and Committee</b> —The elected women’s 
ministries leader develops specific ministries to nurture women and equip 
them for service. She serves as chairperson of the women’s ministries 
committee and encourages ideas and plans that maximize women’s 
contributions to the mission of the Church.</p>
            
<p>The leader assists the board with integrating activities and programs for 
women into the larger church program. She keeps the church informed of the 
contribution of women’s ministries to church life. The leader’s liaison for 
training and resource material is the conference women’s ministries director.
The women’s ministries leader should be a sensitive, caring woman with 
a burden for women’s ministry and concerns, a balance in her perspectives, 
an ability to encourage other women to cultivate their spiritual gifts, and an 
ability to work well with women in the church, the pastor, and the board.</p>
            
<p>The women’s ministries committee fosters ministry to women in the 
church. This committee should be composed of those interested in the broad

<h2>Adventist Youth Ministries</h2>
<p>The various youth organizations of the church should work closely with 
the youth ministries department of the conference. The church works for and 
with its youth through Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM). Under the AYM, 
youth are to work together, in cooperation with the wider church community, 
towards the development of a strong youth ministry that includes spiritual, 
mental, and physical development of each individual, Christian social 
interaction, and an active witnessing program that supports the general soulwinning plans of the church. In the quest for discipleship, the goal of AYM 
should be to bring all youth to a saving relationship with Christ, build them 
up in His Word to reflect a Christ-like character, train them how to serve the 
church and communities using their spiritual gifts, and send them out to reach 
the communities in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            
<p><b>AYM Mission</b><br>To lead young people into a saving relationship with 
Jesus Christ and help them embrace His call to discipleship.</p>
            
<p><b>AYM Motto</b><br> The love of Christ compels us.</p>
            
<p><b>AYM Aim</b><br> The Advent Message to all the world in my generation.
The youth ministries program of the church comprises three broad 
categories, namely: Junior Youth (Adventurers: ages 4-9 and Pathfinders: 
ages 10-15), Senior Youth (Ambassadors: ages 16-21 and Young Adults: 
ages 22-30), and Public Campus Students: ages 16-30+.</p>
            
<p>God said to Moses, “And these words which I command you today shall 
be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall 
talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when 
you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your 
hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them 
on the doorposts of your house and on your gates” (Deut. 6:6-9).
The apostle Paul added, “Let no one despise your youth, but be an 
example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in 
purity” (1 Tim. 4:12).</p>
            
<p>“We have an army of youth today who can do much if they are properly 
directed and encouraged. . . . We want them to be blessed of God. We want 
them to act a part in well-organized plans for helping other youth.”— GCB, 
Jan. 29, 30, 1893, p. 24.</p>
            
<p>“When the youth give their hearts to God, our responsibility for them 
does not cease. They must be interested in the Lord’s work, and led to see 
that He expects them to do something to advance His cause. It is not enough 
to show how much needs to be done, and to urge the youth to act a part. They 
must be taught how to labor for the Master. They must be trained, disciplined, 
drilled, in the best methods of winning souls to Christ. Teach them to try in a 
quiet, unpretending way to help their young companions. Let different 
branches of missionary effort be systematically laid out, in which they may 
take part, and let them be given instruction and help. Thus they will learn to 
work for God.”—GW 210.</p>
            
<p>“With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might 
furnish, how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and soon-coming Savior 
might be carried to the whole world!”—MYP 196.</p>
            
<p>While there is to be an active Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM) in 
every church, it is important that the youth program not be isolated from the 
rest of the church. In addition to their AYM participation, youth should be 
integrated into responsible leadership and in all lines of church work. As 
young elders, deacons, and deaconesses, for example, they can work with and 
learn from experienced officers.</p>
            
<p>“In order that the work may go forward in all its branches, God calls for 
youthful vigor, zeal, and courage. He has chosen the youth to aid in the 
advancement of His cause. To plan with clear mind and execute with 
courageous hand demands fresh, uncrippled energies. Young men and 
women are invited to give God the strength of their youth, that through the 
exercise of their powers, through keen thought and vigorous action, they may 
bring glory to Him and salvation to their fellow men.”—GW 67.</p>
            
<p>

the church board.</p>
            
<p>If there are no distinct Ambassador ministry or young adults ministries 
established in the church, or until such time as they are established, the AYM 
Committee will plan for the senior youth ministry to include both age groups.
In parts of the world where there is no Pathfinder or Adventurer ministry, 
or until such time as they are organized, the AYM Committee will plan for 
appropriate activities for the junior youth.</p>
            
<p>The Young Adults leader may chair the AYM Committee. The 
committee should meet as necessary to develop short- and long-range goals

<p><b>Public Campus Ministries</b><br>Strengthening the Youth Ministries of the 
church, Public Campus Ministries (PCM), in collaboration with the Adventist 
Ministry to College and University Students (AMiCUS), provides vision and 
strategic planning for ministry to and support for Seventh-day Adventist

operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. </p>
            
<p><b>Public Campus Ministries Leader/Coordinator</b><br>The church may 
appoint a Public Campus Ministries leader/coordinator to develop an 
intentional ministry with the purpose of caring for the special needs of college 
or university students in institutions not operated by the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church, in consultation with and support of the Adventist Youth 
Ministries Committee.</p>
            
<p><b>Ambassador Ministry</b><br>The Ambassador Ministry provides a 
specialized program to meet the needs of youth, ages 16 to 21. It offers young 
people in this age group organization and structure, and promotes their active 
involvement in the church, locally and globally. The ministry is designed to 
strengthen the current senior youth ministry of the Church. It challenges them 
to experience and share a personal relationship with Christ, helps them 
develop a lifestyle that is consistent with the Seventh-day Adventist belief 
system, provides training in diverse vocational interests, and provides them 
with a safe environment for the wholesome development of lifelong 
friendships. Its activities are to be carried out in accordance with conference 
policies and in coordination with the AYM Committee of the local church.
            </p>

            <li>Assistant secretary-treasurer</li>
            <li>Music director</li>
</ul>
This group forms the Ambassador Committee which appoints other officers 
for the respective activities. </p>
            
<p><b>Pathfinder Club</b> <br>The Pathfinder Club provides a church-centered 
outlet for the spirit of adventure and exploration, in the context of spiritual 
development and soul-winning, for ages 10 to 15. Activities are carefully 
tailored to include outdoor living, nature exploration, crafts, hobbies, or 
vocations. </p>
            
<p><b>Pathfinder Committee</b> <br>
            The Pathfinder Club director and deputy 
directors are elected by the church. (See pp. 111-112, 184-185.) If two deputy 
directors are elected, there should be one male and one female. One of the 
deputy directors may also serve as club secretary and treasurer.
            </p>
            <p>Additional Pathfinder staff may include instructors of craft and nature 
classes and counselors who are each responsible for a unit of six to eight 
Pathfinders.</p>
            
<p>Resource materials are available from the conference youth ministries 
director.</p>
            
<p>Everyone involved in work with minor children must meet Church and 
legal standards and requirements, such as background checks or certification. 
Local church leaders should consult with the conference, which will ascertain 
and advise as to what background checks and certifications are available 
and/or required. (See Notes, #8, pp. 180-181.)</p>
            
<p>
            <b>Adventurer Club</b><br>
            The Adventurer Club provides home and church 
programs for parents with 4- to 9-year-old children. It is designed to stimulate 
the children’s curiosity and includes age-specific activities that involve both 
parents and child in recreational activities, simple crafts, appreciation of 
God’s creation, and other activities that are of interest to that age. All is 
carried out with a spiritual focus, setting the stage for participation in the 
church as a Pathfinder.</p>
            
<p><b>Adventurer Committee</b> <br>The church elects the club director and 
associates. (See pp. 111-112, 184-185.) Additional staff members are

<p><b>AYM Officers</b> <br>The leaders/directors of the five youth ministry entities 
must exemplify Christlike graces and have a burden for soul winning and 
contagious enthusiasm. The five leaders/directors are members of the church 
board. In helping motivate youth to work together and take responsibilities, 
the leaders/directors will be in the background— guiding, counseling, and 
encouraging youth, helping them gain experience and the joys of 
achievement. The leaders/directors should study the youth profile of the 
church and seek to involve every eligible youth in the Adventist Youth 
Ministries (AYM).</p>
            
<p>The leaders/directors will keep in touch with the pastor, advisor, and the 
conference youth ministries director, taking advantage of opportunities for 
in-service training and leading their respective ministry into a cooperative 
relationship with the church and the conference.</p>
            
<p>The associate leaders/deputy directors (if needed) will assist the 
leaders/directors and perform leadership duties when the leaders/directors are
absent. The respective committees may assign additional responsibilities to 
the associate leaders/directors.</p>
            
<p>The secretary-treasurers will keep a record of the activities of their 
respective ministries, submit monthly reports on forms provided to the 
conference youth ministries director, and encourage youth to report their 
witnessing activities during the ten-minute personal ministries period.
The respective assistant secretary-treasurers (if needed) assist with the 
secretary- treasurers’ work as assigned.</p>
            
<p><b>AYM Advisor</b><br>The Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM) advisor may be 
an elder or other person on the board who understands the objectives of the 
AYM, is sympathetic with youth and their involvement in the church’s 
ministries, and will serve as a valued counselor to the youth. The advisor
serves as a guide or counselor to AYM officers and joins them regularly in 
AYM Committee meetings.</p>
            
<p>The ministry leader should become acquainted with the conference youth 
ministries director and keep the director informed of changes in officer 
personnel and other AYM matters. Along with AYM leaders, the advisor
should attend conference youth training institutes to keep informed about 
developments in youth ministry.</p>
            
<p>For the sake of continuity, the advisor, if possible, should serve multiple 
terms.</p>
            
<p>Everyone involved in work with minor children must meet Church and 
legal standards and requirements, such as background checks or certification. 
Local church leaders should consult with the conference, which will ascertain 
and advise as to what background checks and certifications are available 
and/or required. (See Notes, #8, pp. 180-181.)</p>
