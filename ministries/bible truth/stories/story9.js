  <h2>Lesson 34 - The Church of Christ</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. A Divine Plan</h3>
  <p>
    The Church of Christ is established as part of God's divine plan. Jesus Himself laid the foundation of the church on the truth of Peter’s confession.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Matthew 16:18:</strong> “And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”
    <br>
    This shows that Jesus Christ is the cornerstone and foundation of the church, not human power or strength.
  </p>
  <p>
    The church is founded on Christ, as taught in:
    <strong>Ephesians 2:18-22:</strong> “For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus recognized the authority of the church, as shown in:
    <strong>Matthew 18:17:</strong> “If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the Lord leads people to become members of the church:
    <strong>Acts 2:47:</strong> “Praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. Instruction and Discipline</h3>
  <p>
    God has placed leadership gifts within the church to guide and direct it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Ephesians 4:11:</strong> “And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The leaders are entrusted with the responsibility of caring for the flock:
    <strong>Acts 20:28:</strong> “Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Church members are urged to submit to the leadership of the church:
    <strong>Hebrews 13:17:</strong> “Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The church is supported by various spiritual gifts:
    <strong>1 Corinthians 12:28:</strong> “And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues.”
  </p>
  <p>
    God is the author of order in the church:
    <strong>1 Corinthians 14:33, 40:</strong> “For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. But all things should be done decently and in order.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The church is sometimes required to take extreme measures of discipline:
    <strong>1 Corinthians 5:13:</strong> “Purge the evil person from among you.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 18:15-17:</strong> “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you...”
  </p>
  <p>
    The church is blessed when persecuted:
    <strong>Matthew 5:11-12:</strong> “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven...”
  </p>

  <h3>3. Proclaiming the Gospel</h3>
  <p>
    The church has been entrusted with the important task of proclaiming the gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Mark 16:15-16:</strong> “And he said to them, ‘Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.’”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 10:1, 7:</strong> “And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority... ‘And as you go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of heaven has come near.’”
  </p>
  <p>
    The remnant church will proclaim a special message:
    <strong>Revelation 14:6-12:</strong> This passage describes the three angels’ messages, urging the world to fear God and give Him glory, and to worship the Creator.
  </p>
  <p>
    The church is God’s appointed agency for the salvation of men. It was organized for service, with the mission to carry the gospel to the world:
    <br>
    <strong>Acts of the Apostles 9:</strong> “The church is the repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church will eventually be made manifest, even to the ‘principalities and powers in heavenly places,’ the final and full display of the love of God.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The Church of Christ is established by divine plan, led by God, with the responsibility to teach, correct, and proclaim the gospel, all under Christ’s authority and guidance.
  </p>

Lesson 34 - The Church of Christ

1. A Divine Plan

The Church of Christ is established as part of God's divine plan. Jesus Himself laid the foundation of the church, based on Peter’s confession of faith. In Matthew 16:18, Jesus says, “And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” This highlights that the church is built upon Jesus Christ, who is the cornerstone, not human strength or power.

The church is founded on Christ as emphasized in Ephesians 2:18-22, which states, “For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.”

Furthermore, the authority of the church is recognized by Jesus. In Matthew 18:17, He says, “If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.” The Lord Himself leads people to become members of the church, as seen in Acts 2:47: “Praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.”

2. Instruction and Discipline

God has placed leadership gifts within the church to guide and direct its members. As stated in Ephesians 4:11, “And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.”

The church leaders are entrusted with the responsibility of caring for the flock. Acts 20:28 reminds leaders to, “Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood.”

Church members are encouraged to submit to their leaders. Hebrews 13:17 says, “Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account.”

The church is supported by various spiritual gifts, as described in 1 Corinthians 12:28: “And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues.”

God is the author of order within the church, as we learn in 1 Corinthians 14:33, 40: “For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. But all things should be done decently and in order.” At times, the church may be required to take extreme measures of discipline. For example, 1 Corinthians 5:13 advises, “Purge the evil person from among you.” Similarly, Matthew 18:15-17 outlines a process of reconciliation that involves talking to the person privately, then involving others, and if necessary, bringing the issue before the church.

Even when the church faces persecution, it is blessed. Matthew 5:11-12 tells us, “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven.”

3. Proclaiming the Gospel

The church has been entrusted with the vital task of proclaiming the gospel. Mark 16:15-16 records Jesus saying, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.”

In Matthew 10:1, 7, Jesus gives authority to His disciples to proclaim, “The kingdom of heaven has come near.” The church’s mission includes proclaiming the gospel message, as shown in Revelation 14:6-12, which describes the three angels’ messages calling the world to fear God and worship the Creator.

The church is God’s appointed agency for the salvation of mankind. It was organized to serve and to carry the gospel to the world. As recorded in Acts of the Apostles 9, “The church is the repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church will eventually be made manifest, even to the ‘principalities and powers in heavenly places,’ the final and full display of the love of God.”

Notes:
The Church of Christ is established by divine plan, under God’s leadership. It is entrusted with the responsibility to teach, correct, and proclaim the gospel, all under Christ’s authority and guidance.

  <h2>Lesson 35 - Baptism</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Baptism as a Christian Ordinance</h3>
  <p>
    Baptism is a <strong>sacred ordinance</strong> that marks the entrance into the church of God. It is inseparably connected with the <strong>gospel commission</strong>, as outlined in the Great Commission.
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 28:19-20:</strong> “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.”
    <br>
    <strong>Mark 16:15-16:</strong> “And he said to them, ‘Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.’”
  </p>
  <p>
    Baptism is a <strong>positive requirement</strong> of the gospel. Jesus Himself was baptized, not as a confession of sin, but as an example for His followers.
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 3:13-17:</strong> “Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, ‘I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?’ But Jesus answered him, ‘Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.’ Then he consented.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Manner of Baptism</h3>
  <p>
    The only method of baptism revealed in the Bible is baptism by <strong>immersion</strong>. This is the method used by John the Baptist, the first known figure to baptize.
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 3:5-6:</strong> “Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 3:13-16:</strong> “Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water...”
    <br>
    <strong>John 3:23:</strong> “John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <strong>baptize</strong> means “to plunge,” “to dip,” or “to immerse.” These meanings are distinct from terms like “sprinkle” or “pour.”
    <br>
    <strong>Acts 8:29-39:</strong> “...and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.”
    <br>
    <strong>Ephesians 4:5:</strong> “There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. What Baptism Signifies</h3>
  <p>
    Baptism signifies a complete change of character, symbolizing the <strong>death</strong> to the old nature and the acceptance of a <strong>new life</strong> in Christ.
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 6:3-4:</strong> “Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.”
    <br>
    Baptism represents the death and burial of the past life of sin and the <strong>resurrection</strong> to a new life in Christ.
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 6:6:</strong> “We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The old nature must die so that the believer can live a new life in Christ.
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 6:8-11:</strong> “Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him... So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.”
  </p>

  <h3>4. Prerequisites for Baptism</h3>
  <p>
    The following are prerequisites for baptism:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faith in Christ</strong> as a personal Savior:
        <br><strong>Acts 16:30-31:</strong> “Then he brought them out and said, ‘Sirs, what must I do to be saved?’ And they said, ‘Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.’”
      </li>
      <li><strong>Repentance</strong> from sin:
        <br><strong>Matthew 3:7-8:</strong> “But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, ‘You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.’”
      </li>
      <li><strong>Obedience to God’s commandments</strong> and instruction in the Christian life:
        <br><strong>Acts 16:31; Matthew 28:20:</strong> “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations... teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>5. The Gift of the Spirit</h3>
  <p>
    The gift of the Holy Spirit is promised to those who enter into the full significance of baptism.
    <br>
    <strong>Acts 2:38:</strong> “And Peter said to them, ‘Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.’”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Mark 1:9-11:</strong> “In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Baptism by immersion is essential, but it is the Holy Spirit who enables the believer to live the Christian life.
    <br>
    <strong>Acts 10:44-48:</strong> The Holy Spirit is given before baptism, but baptism should not be omitted.
    <br>
    <strong>Ephesians 3:16-17:</strong> “That according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.”
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 8:14-16:</strong> “For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, ‘Abba! Father!’”
  </p>
  <p>
    The baptized Christian is empowered to live for heavenly things.
    <br>
    <strong>Colossians 3:1-3:</strong> “If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Baptism, while an outward sign, signifies an inward transformation. It is essential for the Christian life and marks the believer’s commitment to living according to Christ’s teachings.

Lesson 35 - Baptism

Baptism is a sacred ordinance that signifies the entrance into the Church of God. It is closely linked with the gospel commission given by Jesus Christ. In Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus commands His followers to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Similarly, Mark 16:15-16 emphasizes that baptism is essential for salvation, stating that whoever believes and is baptized will be saved. Jesus Himself was baptized, not as a confession of sin, but as an example for His followers to follow. In Matthew 3:13-17, we see Jesus coming to John the Baptist to be baptized, fulfilling all righteousness.

The method of baptism revealed in the Bible is by immersion. This was the practice of John the Baptist, as seen in Matthew 3:5-6, where people were baptized by him in the Jordan River. Further evidence of immersion is found in Matthew 3:13-16, where Jesus goes into the water to be baptized. The term "baptize" literally means "to plunge," "to dip," or "to immerse," which is distinct from sprinkling or pouring. In Acts 8:29-39, we see both Philip and the eunuch going down into the water for baptism, further demonstrating immersion as the biblical method.

Baptism signifies a complete change of character. It symbolizes the death of the old nature and the acceptance of new life in Christ. Romans 6:3-4 explains that those who are baptized into Christ Jesus are baptized into His death, and as Christ was raised from the dead, we too are called to walk in newness of life. Baptism represents the death and burial of the old life of sin, followed by the resurrection to a new life. Romans 6:6 says that the old self is crucified with Christ so that the body of sin is brought to nothing, and we are no longer slaves to sin. The believer is called to consider themselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus, as described in Romans 6:8-11.

Before being baptized, certain prerequisites must be met. First, a person must have faith in Christ as their personal Savior, as we see in Acts 16:30-31. Second, repentance from sin is necessary, as John the Baptist emphasized in Matthew 3:7-8. Finally, obedience to God’s commandments and instruction in the Christian life is required, as seen in Acts 16:31 and Matthew 28:20.

The gift of the Holy Spirit is promised to those who embrace the full significance of baptism. Acts 2:38 states that when one repents and is baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, they will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Mark 1:9-11 recounts how, after Jesus was baptized, the Spirit descended upon Him like a dove. While baptism by immersion is essential, it is the Holy Spirit who enables the believer to live the Christian life. Acts 10:44-48 and Ephesians 3:16-17 remind us that the Holy Spirit strengthens the believer, empowering them to live a life aligned with Christ’s teachings. Romans 8:14-16 speaks of how those led by the Spirit are children of God, and in Colossians 3:1-3, we are encouraged to set our minds on things above, seeking the things of heaven.

In conclusion, baptism is not merely an outward sign but signifies an inward transformation. It is an essential part of the Christian life and marks the believer’s commitment to living according to the teachings of Jesus Christ.

  <h2>Lesson 36 - Commemorative Ordinances</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Ordinance of Humility</h3>
  <p>
    The ordinance of humility is a significant act within the Christian faith, symbolizing Christ’s humility and service to humanity. 
    It commemorates Christ’s incarnation and His example of selflessness.
    <br>
    <strong>John 13:1-5:</strong> “Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end. And supper being ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray Him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God, rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ’s act of washing His disciples' feet represents His willingness to serve. He humbled Himself, removing His outer robe and girding Himself as a servant. This mirrors His incarnation where, although He was equal to God, He “emptied Himself” to take on the form of a servant and die for humanity’s sins.
    <br>
    <strong>Philippians 2:5-8:</strong> “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>John 13:6-11:</strong> Peter objects to Jesus washing his feet, but Jesus emphasizes that this act is necessary for fellowship with Him. The washing symbolizes the cleansing from sin, which is essential for maintaining a relationship with Christ.
    <br>
    <strong>Titus 3:5:</strong> “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.”
    <br>
    <strong>John 15:3:</strong> “You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>John 13:12-17:</strong> Jesus’ act of humility sets the example for His followers. Christians are called to emulate His attitude of service toward one another.
    <br>
    Ellen White writes, “This ordinance is Christ’s appointed preparation for the sacramental service. While pride, variance, and strife for supremacy are cherished, the heart cannot enter into fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared to receive the communion of His body and His blood. Therefore it was that Jesus appointed the memorial of His humiliation to be first observed.” (Desire of Ages, p. 650)
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Lord’s Supper</h3>
  <p>
    The Lord's Supper is a solemn ordinance commemorating Christ's death and the new covenant in His blood. It is a reminder of the sacrifice Christ made for humanity.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 15:2-4:</strong> “By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.”
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Old Testament, the Passover meal reminded the Israelites of God’s deliverance. In the New Testament, the Lord's Supper serves a similar purpose, pointing to Christ's sacrificial death.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 5:7:</strong> “For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The bread and wine in the Lord’s Supper symbolize Christ’s body and blood, signifying the sacrifice He made for humanity’s redemption.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 11:23-24:</strong> “For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, ‘Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.’”
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 11:25:</strong> “In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.’”
  </p>
  <p>
    The wine represents Christ’s blood, which ratified the new covenant and serves as a symbol of His life sacrificed for the forgiveness of sins.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 11:26:</strong> “For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The participation in the Lord's Supper is a serious matter and calls for self-examination to ensure one is partaking in a worthy manner.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 11:27-29:</strong> “Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.”
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 11:28:</strong> “But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The Lord’s Supper is not only a reminder of Christ’s death but also signifies entering into the experience of the gospel.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 10:16:</strong> “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?”
  </p>
  <p>
    The ordinances of humility and the Lord’s Supper are to be observed by Christians until Christ returns.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 11:26:</strong> “For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 26:26-29:</strong> “And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, ‘Take, eat; this is My body.’ Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink from it, all of you. For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom.’”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The ordinance of humility prepares the heart for the communion of the Lord’s Supper, and both serve as ongoing reminders of Christ’s sacrifice and the establishment of the new covenant.

Lesson 36 - Commemorative Ordinances

Date: Saturday, November 25, 2023

1. The Ordinance of Humility

The ordinance of humility holds great significance within the Christian faith. It symbolizes Christ’s humility and His service to humanity, commemorating His incarnation and selfless example. In John 13:1-5, we read that before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knew His time had come to depart from the world to the Father. After the supper, Jesus rose, laid aside His garments, and took a towel, girding Himself as a servant to wash His disciples' feet. This act shows His willingness to serve, and it reflects His incarnation, where, though He was equal to God, He humbled Himself to take on the form of a servant and die for humanity’s sins, as described in Philippians 2:5-8.

In John 13:6-11, Peter initially objects to Jesus washing his feet, but Jesus explains that this act is essential for fellowship with Him. The washing symbolizes cleansing from sin, a vital part of maintaining a relationship with Christ. Titus 3:5 affirms this, saying, “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.” Jesus emphasizes the importance of this act of humility, calling His followers to emulate His service toward one another, as seen in John 13:12-17.

Ellen White, in Desire of Ages, writes that the ordinance of humility is Christ's preparation for the sacramental service. Pride, variance, and strife must be set aside in order for the heart to enter into fellowship with Christ and to be prepared to receive His communion.

2. The Lord’s Supper

The Lord's Supper is a solemn ordinance that commemorates Christ’s death and the new covenant in His blood, serving as a reminder of the great sacrifice Christ made for humanity. In 1 Corinthians 15:2-4, Paul reminds us that the gospel is the means of our salvation, stating, “For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.” The Lord's Supper is a continuation of the Jewish Passover, which reminded the Israelites of God’s deliverance. In the New Testament, it points to Christ’s sacrificial death for our redemption, as seen in 1 Corinthians 5:7, which says, “For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.”

In 1 Corinthians 11:23-24, Paul shares how Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” He also took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me,” as described in 1 Corinthians 11:25.

The wine in the Lord’s Supper symbolizes Christ’s blood, which ratified the new covenant and serves as a symbol of His life sacrificed for the forgiveness of sins. In 1 Corinthians 11:26, Paul writes, “For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes.” Participating in the Lord's Supper is a serious matter and calls for self-examination to ensure we partake in a worthy manner, as Paul warns in 1 Corinthians 11:27-29.

The Lord's Supper is not only a reminder of Christ’s death but also signifies entering into the experience of the gospel. Paul states in 1 Corinthians 10:16, “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?”

Both the ordinance of humility and the Lord’s Supper are to be observed by Christians until Christ returns. In 1 Corinthians 11:26, we are reminded, “For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes.” Similarly, in Matthew 26:26-29, Jesus institutes the Lord’s Supper with His disciples, promising that He will drink it anew with them in His Father’s kingdom.

Notes:

The ordinance of humility prepares our hearts for the communion of the Lord’s Supper. Together, these ordinances serve as ongoing reminders of Christ’s sacrifice and the establishment of the new covenant, emphasizing the importance of humility, service, and remembrance of His sacrifice.

  <h2>Lesson 37 - Tithes and Offerings</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. God as the Owner of All</h3>
  <p>
    God is the rightful owner of the world and everything in it. This understanding is foundational to the biblical view of tithes and offerings.
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 24:1:</strong> "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein."
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 50:10-12:</strong> “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof.”
    <br>
    <strong>Haggai 2:8:</strong> “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. Stewardship of God's Goods</h3>
  <p>
    Since man owns nothing but is entrusted with God's goods, he is in the position of a steward. 
    <br>
    <strong>1 Timothy 6:7:</strong> “For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 25:14:</strong> “For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.”
    <br>
    <strong>Deuteronomy 8:18:</strong> “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. Responsibility as Stewards</h3>
  <p>
    God has given us clear instructions on how to discharge our responsibility as stewards of His goods.
    <br>
    <strong>Ephesians 5:5:</strong> “For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.”
    <br>
    <strong>Luke 12:15:</strong> “And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.”
    <br>
    <strong>Deuteronomy 14:22:</strong> “Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.”
    <br>
    <strong>Proverbs 3:9:</strong> “Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase.”
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Tithe as God's Claim</h3>
  <p>
    God claimed a tithe (a tenth) of all income from the children of Israel for the support of His work.
    <br>
    <strong>Leviticus 27:30-33:</strong> “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 23:23:</strong> Jesus acknowledged the tithing principle as a divine obligation: "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
  </p>

  <h3>5. The Pre-Israelite Tithing Principle</h3>
  <p>
    The principle of tithing existed before Israel as a nation, making it not simply a Jewish institution.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 14:17-24:</strong> Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek, acknowledging God’s sovereignty.
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 7:1-2:</strong> “For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all.”
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 28:20-22:</strong> Jacob promised to give a tenth of his possessions to God, saying, “...of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.”
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 9:11-14:</strong> The support of the gospel ministry should be sustained just like the Levitical priesthood was sustained by the tithe.
    <br>
    <strong>Numbers 18:20-21:</strong> “And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance.”
  </p>

  <h3>6. Freewill Offerings</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to tithes, God expects freewill offerings as part of our worship and expression of gratitude.
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 96:8:</strong> “Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.”
    <br>
    <strong>2 Corinthians 9:7:</strong> “Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.”
    <br>
    <strong>Deuteronomy 16:16-17:</strong> “Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the Lord empty: Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee.”
    <br>
    <strong>Acts 20:35:</strong> “I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.”
  </p>

  <h3>7. Rewards for Faithful Stewardship</h3>
  <p>
    God promises blessings to those who are faithful in their stewardship, but withholds blessings from the unfaithful.
    <br>
    <strong>Malachi 3:8-10:</strong> “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 6:19-21:</strong> “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Tithing is not only a scriptural command but also a way for believers to participate in the work of the gospel and honor God with their resources. The blessings of faithfulness in stewardship are far greater than any material gain.
  </p>

            
            <!--
Lesson 37 - Tithes and Offerings

1. God as the Owner of All

God is the rightful owner of the world and everything in it. This understanding is foundational to the biblical view of tithes and offerings. The Psalms remind us that "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein" (Psalm 24:1). God owns all, including the animals and the land. As Psalm 50:10-12 declares, "For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills... for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof." Even the silver and gold belong to God, as Haggai 2:8 says, "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine."

2. Stewardship of God's Goods

Since man owns nothing but is entrusted with God's goods, he is a steward of those resources. 1 Timothy 6:7 reminds us that "we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out." In Matthew 25:14, Jesus teaches that the kingdom of heaven is like a man who entrusts his servants with his goods. Deuteronomy 8:18 also emphasizes that it is God who gives us the power to get wealth.

3. Responsibility as Stewards

God has given us clear instructions on how to be faithful stewards. In Ephesians 5:5, we are reminded that "no unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God." Luke 12:15 warns us to beware of covetousness, reminding us that "a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." We are instructed in Deuteronomy 14:22 to tithe all the increase of our crops, and Proverbs 3:9 encourages us to "honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase."

4. The Tithe as God's Claim

God claimed a tenth (a tithe) of all income from the children of Israel for the support of His work. Leviticus 27:30-33 declares that "all the tithe of the land... is the Lord's; it is holy unto the Lord." Jesus acknowledged the principle of tithing as a divine obligation in Matthew 23:23, where He chastised the Pharisees for neglecting "the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith" while paying tithes.

5. The Pre-Israelite Tithing Principle

The principle of tithing existed before Israel as a nation. Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek, recognizing God's sovereignty, as recorded in Genesis 14:17-24. Hebrews 7:1-2 affirms this act, saying Abraham "gave a tenth part of all." Likewise, in Genesis 28:20-22, Jacob promised to give a tenth of his possessions to God. The New Testament also connects the principle of tithing to supporting the gospel ministry, as seen in 1 Corinthians 9:11-14 and Numbers 18:20-21.

6. Freewill Offerings

In addition to tithes, God expects freewill offerings as part of our worship and gratitude. Psalm 96:8 says, "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts." In 2 Corinthians 9:7, we are encouraged to give "as he purposeth in his heart... for God loveth a cheerful giver." Deuteronomy 16:16-17 tells us to give as we are able, according to God's blessing. Acts 20:35 reminds us of the words of Jesus: "It is more blessed to give than to receive."

7. Rewards for Faithful Stewardship

God promises blessings to those who are faithful in their stewardship but withholds blessings from the unfaithful. Malachi 3:8-10 urges believers to bring tithes into the storehouse, promising that God will "open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing." Jesus also teaches in Matthew 6:19-21 that we should "lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven," where treasures are secure and eternal.

Notes:

Tithing is not only a command from Scripture but also a way for believers to participate in the work of the gospel and honor God with their resources. The blessings that come from faithful stewardship far exceed any material gain we might receive.

  <h2>Lesson 38 - The Prophetic Gift</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Prophetic Gift in Old Testament Times</h3>
  <p>
    In the Old Testament, God communicated His message to the people through the gift of prophecy.
    <br>
    <strong>Hosea 12:10:</strong> “I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets gave parables.”
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 1:1:</strong> “Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets.”
    <br>
    <strong>Amos 3:7:</strong> “For the Lord God does nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets.”
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 1:21:</strong> “For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”
    <br>
    <strong>2 Chronicles 20:20:</strong> “Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be established; believe His prophets, and you will succeed.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The prosperity of Israel was linked to their response to the prophets' message.
    <br>
    <strong>2 Chronicles 36:14-21:</strong> “All the officers of the priests and the people likewise were exceedingly unfaithful, following all the abominations of the nations… and the Lord, the God of their fathers, sent persistently to them by His messengers, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place. But they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising His words and scoffing at His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose against His people, until there was no remedy.”
  </p>
  <p>
    While many prophets contributed to the Scriptures, some, like Elijah and Elisha, did not leave written records. Despite their significant roles, their messages were passed on orally.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Prophecy in New Testament Times</h3>
  <p>
    The gift of prophecy did not cease after the advent of Christ. Even after His ascension, prophets continued to serve as God's messengers.
    <br>
    <strong>Luke 2:25-26, 36:</strong> These verses speak about three prophets who announced the coming of Christ. “Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon... and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ... And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel... she did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 11:9:</strong> Jesus references prophets who foretold His coming: “But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.”
    <br>
    <strong>Acts 11:27-28:</strong> “Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world.”
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 1:1:</strong> “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Disappearance of the Prophetic Gift</h3>
  <p>
    After the apostolic era, the gift of prophecy gradually disappeared from the professed church, likely because of disobedience to God’s law.
    <br>
    <strong>Ezekiel 7:26:</strong> “Disaster after disaster will come, and there will be no vision of the prophet, nor will there be any instruction from the priest or counsel from the elders.”
    <br>
    <strong>Proverbs 29:18:</strong> “Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.”
    <br>
    <strong>Daniel 7:25:</strong> “He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.”
    <br>
    This prophecy refers to the apostate powers that arose after the apostles, leading people away from God's law.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Prophetic Gift in the Last Days</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible teaches that in the last days, God’s true church will be a commandment-keeping church and will possess the gift of prophecy.
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 12:17:</strong> “Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.”
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 19:10:</strong> “For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”
    <br>
    <strong>Joel 2:28-32:</strong> “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy... the Lord says, and it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The gift of prophecy is integral to God’s communication with His people, from Old Testament times to the present. While it diminished for a time due to disobedience, the promise remains that in the last days, prophecy will be restored to guide God’s true church in keeping His commandments.
  </p>

            
            <!--
In the Old Testament, God communicated His message to the people through the gift of prophecy. Scriptures such as Hosea 12:10 and Hebrews 1:1 affirm that God spoke to His people through the prophets. Prophets were chosen by God to reveal His will, and their messages were crucial to the well-being of Israel. In 2 Chronicles 20:20, it is emphasized that the prosperity of Israel depended on believing in God and His prophets. However, some prophets, like Elijah and Elisha, did not leave written records, yet their oral messages were significant and passed down through generations.

In New Testament times, the gift of prophecy continued even after the ascension of Christ. For instance, in Luke 2:25-36, prophets such as Simeon and Anna foretold the coming of Christ. In Matthew 11:9, Jesus recognized the role of prophets who foretold His arrival. The book of Acts (11:27-28) describes the prophet Agabus, who foretold a great famine. Revelation 1:1 also underscores the ongoing prophetic message delivered to John through an angel.

However, after the apostolic era, the gift of prophecy gradually disappeared from the church. Ezekiel 7:26 and Proverbs 29:18 highlight the consequences of a lack of vision and disobedience to God’s law, which likely contributed to the fading of this gift. Daniel 7:25 warns about powers that would arise after the apostles and lead people away from God’s law.

In the last days, the Bible teaches that the gift of prophecy will be restored to God's true church. Revelation 12:17 and 19:10 reveal that the church will be characterized by keeping God's commandments and holding the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy. Joel 2:28-32 further prophesies that God will pour out His Spirit, and both sons and daughters will prophesy, signaling the restoration of the prophetic gift in the final days.

The gift of prophecy has always been central to God's communication with His people. Though it disappeared for a time due to disobedience, the Bible promises that it will be restored in the last days to guide God’s true church in keeping His commandments.

  <h2>Lesson 39 - Tests of a True Prophet</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Introduction: The Need for Testing Prophecies</h3>
  <p>
    There is a crucial need to test the claims of anyone professing to exercise the gift of prophecy. This is because Satan often counterfeits the work of God, leading people astray.
  </p>

  <h3>1. False Methods of Communication</h3>
  <p>
    There are various false methods through which individuals may claim to communicate from God. These include practices like fortune-telling and spiritualism, which are condemned in the Bible:
    <br>
    <strong>Deuteronomy 18:9-12:</strong> “When you come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abominable practices of those nations. There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer...”
    <br>
    <strong>Leviticus 20:6, 27:</strong> “If a person turns to mediums and necromancers, whoring after them, I will set my face against that person and will cut him off from among his people... A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death.”
    <br>
    <strong>Isaiah 47:12-14:</strong> “Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, with which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you may be able to succeed... Behold, they are like stubble; the fire consumes them.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The New Testament warns of false prophets and teachers who may deceive many, especially in the last days:
    <br>
    <strong>1 John 4:1:</strong> “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 24:24:</strong> “For false Christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. Challenge to Distinguish the True from the False</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible challenges us to distinguish true prophets from false ones, a task that requires careful testing.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Thessalonians 5:19-21:</strong> “Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. Primary Bible Tests of a Prophet</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>a. Harmony with the revealed will of God (Scripture):</strong>
      <br>
      True prophets will always align their messages with the teachings of Scripture.
      <br>
      <strong>Isaiah 8:19-20:</strong> “And when they say to you, ‘Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,’ should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living? To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn.”
      <br>
      <strong>Matthew 4:4:</strong> “But he answered, ‘It is written, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.”’”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>b. Fruits (results) of the personal life and teachings:</strong>
      <br>
      The character and actions of the prophet will reflect God’s righteousness and produce good fruit.
      <br>
      <strong>Matthew 7:15-20:</strong> “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>c. Loyal to all aspects of the Bible’s teaching about Christ:</strong>
      <br>
      A true prophet will be faithful to the teachings of Christ as revealed in the Bible.
      <br>
      <strong>1 John 4:1-3:</strong> “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God... Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>d. Fulfilled predictions:</strong>
      <br>
      A true prophet's predictions will come to pass. However, this test is not always conclusive because:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Satan may sometimes predict true events through false prophets or mediums.
          <br>
          <strong>Deuteronomy 13:1-3:</strong> “If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass... you shall not listen to the words of that prophet...”
        </li>
        <li>
          There may be conditional prophecies that require obedience for fulfillment.
          <br>
          <strong>Jonah 3:4, 10:</strong> “Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he called out, ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!’ But when God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.”
        </li>
        <li>
          A true prophet’s prediction will come to pass without fail.
          <br>
          <strong>Jeremiah 28:16-17:</strong> “Therefore thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion against the Lord.’”
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Secondary Bible Tests of a Prophet</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>a. Timeliness of a prophet’s message:</strong>
      <br>
      True prophets bring timely messages in times of need, like Noah, John the Baptist, and the major and minor prophets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>b. Practicality:</strong>
      <br>
      The prophet’s message must meet genuine needs and not be fanciful or self-serving.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>c. High spiritual plane:</strong>
      <br>
      True prophets focus on issues of sin, righteousness, and salvation, unlike modern psychics who often deal with secular matters.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>d. Physical phenomena:</strong>
      <br>
      Some prophets have experienced physical manifestations, but this is not a conclusive test, as Satan could counterfeit such phenomena.
      <br>

Lesson 39 - Tests of a True Prophet

The need to test the claims of those professing to exercise the gift of prophecy is crucial. This is because Satan often counterfeits the work of God, leading people astray. The Bible emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between true and false prophets, especially in the context of the last days.

There are many false methods through which individuals may claim to communicate from God, such as practices like fortune-telling and spiritualism, which the Bible condemns. In Deuteronomy 18:9-12, God warns His people not to follow the abominable practices of divination, fortune-telling, and sorcery. Similarly, Leviticus 20:6-27 and Isaiah 47:12-14 denounce mediums and necromancers. The New Testament further cautions believers against false prophets, as seen in 1 John 4:1 and Matthew 24:24. These scriptures warn that false prophets will arise, performing signs and wonders to deceive many.

The Bible challenges believers to carefully distinguish true prophets from false ones. In 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21, it is written, “Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good.” This emphasizes the importance of testing everything and holding onto what aligns with God’s truth.

There are primary Bible tests for a true prophet. First, true prophets’ messages must align with the revealed will of God in Scripture. Isaiah 8:19-20 and Matthew 4:4 show that a true prophet will speak in harmony with God’s Word. Second, the fruits of a prophet’s life and teachings should reflect God’s righteousness, as seen in Matthew 7:15-20. Third, true prophets are loyal to all aspects of the Bible’s teaching about Christ, as described in 1 John 4:1-3. Finally, the predictions made by a true prophet must come to pass. However, this test can be complicated, as Deuteronomy 13:1-3 shows that false prophets may also predict true events, and some prophecies may be conditional, as seen in Jonah 3:4,10. A true prophet’s predictions, however, will always come to pass without fail, as confirmed in Jeremiah 28:16-17.

Secondary Bible tests of a prophet include the timeliness of the message, practicality, spiritual focus, physical phenomena, and evidence of being free from external influence. True prophets bring timely messages that meet genuine needs and focus on issues of sin, righteousness, and salvation. While some prophets experience physical manifestations, these should not be relied upon as conclusive evidence, as Satan can counterfeit such phenomena. Furthermore, a true prophet must not be influenced by external pressures or false accusations, as demonstrated in Jeremiah 43:2-3.

Seventh-day Adventists believe they are the remnant church of Revelation 12:17, as they keep God’s commandments. This claim, however, is valid only if they also possess "the testimony of Jesus Christ," which is the spirit of prophecy. Revelation 12:17 speaks of those who keep God’s commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus. The gift of prophecy has been restored in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with Ellen G. White’s life and work fulfilling the biblical tests of a true prophet.

The gift of prophecy remains a crucial aspect of God’s plan for His church in the last days. Those who claim this gift must meet the biblical tests outlined in Scripture, ensuring that their message and actions align with the truth of God’s Word.
