  <h2>Lesson 18 - Christ’s Ministry in Heaven</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Christ the Only Mediator Between God and Man</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ is the <strong>only mediator</strong> between God and humanity.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Timothy 2:5:</strong> “For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ’s unique role as mediator is possible because He is both fully God and fully man. This allows Him to bridge the gap caused by sin.
    <br>
    <em>“By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God.”</em> (Desire of Ages, p. 24)
  </p>

  <h3>2. Christ the True High Priest</h3>
  <p>
    In the Old Testament, God appointed high priests to mediate between the people and Himself. However, these earthly priests were limited and could not provide full access to God.
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 8:5:</strong> “They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: ‘See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.’”
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus is the true and perfect high priest, ministering not in an earthly tabernacle, but in the heavenly sanctuary.
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 3:1:</strong> “Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.”
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 8:1-2:</strong> “We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.”
  </p>
  <p>
    As the heavenly high priest, Jesus is fully capable of saving sinners.
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 7:25:</strong> “Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Benefits of Christ’s Priesthood</h3>
  <p>
    The priestly ministry of Christ provides a <strong>complete salvation</strong> for all who come to God through Him.
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 7:25:</strong> (reiterated) “...he is able to save completely those who come to God through him...”
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Culmination of Christ’s Work</h3>
  <p>
    After His heavenly ministry is complete, Christ will return to earth. This second coming will result in the <strong>restoration of all things</strong>.
    <br>
    <strong>Acts 3:19-21:</strong> “Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah... Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.”
  </p>
  <p>
    His final work as mediator will involve <strong>judgment</strong>.
    <br>
    <strong>Acts 17:31:</strong> “For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ will return as <strong>King and Judge</strong>, bringing justice and establishing His kingdom.
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 19:11-16:</strong>
    <br>
    “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True... He judges and wages war... On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Christ’s heavenly ministry is not just symbolic—it is an active, ongoing work of intercession and preparation. His dual nature as both divine and human makes Him the perfect high priest and mediator. His return will mark the final phase of His plan of redemption: judgment and the full restoration of God's original purpose for creation.
  </p>

Lesson 18 – Christ’s Ministry in Heaven

Today, we explore Christ’s ministry in heaven, focusing on His unique role as our Mediator, High Priest, and coming King.

Christ the Only Mediator Between God and Man
The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity. In 1 Timothy 2:5, it says, “For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus.” Jesus alone bridges the gap caused by sin because He is both fully God and fully man. This dual nature allows Him to connect heaven and earth. As expressed in Desire of Ages, page 24, “By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God.”

Christ the True High Priest
In the Old Testament, high priests were appointed to stand between God and the people. However, these human priests had limitations. They served in an earthly sanctuary, which was merely a shadow of the real sanctuary in heaven. Hebrews 8:5 tells us, “They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven.” Jesus, on the other hand, is the true and perfect high priest. He ministers not in an earthly building, but in the heavenly tabernacle.
Hebrews 3:1 urges us to, “Fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.” And in Hebrews 8:1-2, we’re told that “We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.” This means Jesus is actively ministering on our behalf in heaven. And He is fully capable of saving us. Hebrews 7:25 assures us, “Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.”

The Benefits of Christ’s Priesthood
Christ’s priestly ministry is powerful. It provides complete salvation to all who come to God through Him. Hebrews 7:25 reminds us again that Jesus saves completely and intercedes for us continually.

The Culmination of Christ’s Work
Christ’s work in heaven will not continue forever. One day, it will be completed, and He will return to earth. His second coming will mark the restoration of all things. Acts 3:19-21 says, “Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah… Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything.”
When Jesus returns, He will also come as Judge. Acts 17:31 states, “For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed.” Revelation 19 paints a dramatic picture of His return. In verses 11 to 16, we read about a white horse and its rider, who is called Faithful and True. He judges and makes war in righteousness. And written on His robe and thigh is the title: “King of Kings and Lord of Lords.”

Final Thoughts
Christ’s ministry in heaven is not just symbolic—it is a real, ongoing work. Right now, Jesus is actively interceding for us. His unique identity as both God and man makes Him the perfect mediator and high priest. And when His heavenly work is done, He will return—not just as Savior, but as Judge and King—to restore everything and fulfill God’s plan for creation.

Lesson 19: The Day of Atonement

The Jewish Day of Atonement was a sacred and solemn occasion observed every year on the tenth day of the seventh month of the Jewish calendar. On this day, the people of Israel were called to rest, fast, and undergo ritual cleansing as a congregation. According to Leviticus 23:27, it was a holy convocation during which they were to "afflict their souls" and present an offering by fire to the Lord.
Leviticus chapters 16 and 23 provide detailed instructions about the Day of Atonement, including the specific animals used and the duties of the high priest. The animals included a bullock for the high priest’s sin offering, two goats for the people—one for the Lord and one for Azazel—and rams for burnt offerings on behalf of both the priest and the people.
A unique feature of this ritual was the distinction between the two goats. One was sacrificed to the Lord, while the other, referred to as the scapegoat or Azazel, was released into the wilderness. As Leviticus 16:8 explains, Aaron cast lots over the two goats to determine their roles. Aaron also sacrificed the bullock for his own sins and sprinkled its blood inside the veil, as described in Leviticus 16:14.
After making atonement for himself, the high priest proceeded to atone for the people by sprinkling the goat’s blood in the Most Holy Place. The live goat, symbolizing Azazel, had the sins of the people confessed over it before being sent away into the wilderness, as we read in Leviticus 16:21. This act represented the removal of sin from the community.
Once the scapegoat was released, the high priest performed additional rituals. He bathed, changed his garments, and offered burnt offerings for himself and the people. The remains of the earlier sin offerings were then taken outside the camp and burned.
The Day of Atonement was not just about ritual—it held deep symbolic and prophetic significance. It represented a day of judgment, a theme echoed in the New Testament. Acts 17:31 and Romans 14:10,12 emphasize that all will stand before the judgment seat of Christ and give an account of their lives.
The ultimate goal of the services on the Day of Atonement was to remove sin and restore purity between God and His people. This included the cleansing of the sanctuary, as the high priest entered the Most Holy Place and sprinkled blood before the Ark. Hebrews 9:7 reminds us that this was done once a year, for both the priest’s and the people's sins. Daniel 8:14 connects this cleansing to a prophetic timeline, pointing forward to a greater spiritual cleansing.
While the earthly sanctuary was cleansed with the blood of animals, the heavenly sanctuary is cleansed through the blood of Christ. First John 1:7 assures us that the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin. Hebrews 9:13-14 and 1 Peter 1:18-19 further explain that Christ’s blood has greater power than animal sacrifices, offering true redemption.
The act of sprinkling blood over the law inside the Ark symbolized how Christ's righteousness satisfies the demands of God's law. The scapegoat, representing Satan, bore the blame but was not considered a sacrifice. It illustrated Satan’s role in the origin of sin. The confession over the scapegoat, as recorded in Leviticus 16:21, showed how the guilt of sin was placed on the head of the one truly responsible.
The high priest’s change of garments after the rituals symbolized the end of his intercessory work for that day. Finally, the offering of two rams was a sign of the people’s renewed dedication and consecration to God.
In conclusion, the Day of Atonement was more than a ritual—it was a prophetic shadow of Christ's heavenly ministry and the final judgment. It teaches us about God's justice, His mercy, and His longing to purify and restore His people into a right relationship with Him.

  <h2>Lesson 20 - The Cleansing of the Sanctuary</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, November 25, 2023</p>

  <h3>1. The Divine Program of Events</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>a.</strong> God operates on a divine timetable. <br>
    <em>Ecclesiastes 3:1</em> – “To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”<br>
    <em>Galatians 4:4</em> – “But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>b.</strong> The cleansing of the sanctuary marks the last phase of Christ’s priestly ministry. <br>
    <em>Daniel 8:14</em> – “Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”<br>
    According to <em>Ezekiel 4:6</em> and <em>Numbers 14:34</em>, a prophetic day represents a literal year. Thus, 2300 days = 2300 years.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Time Period (2300 Days) Is Not Immediately Explained</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 8:14–27</em> – Gabriel explains the ram, goat, and little horn, but not the 2300-day period. Daniel becomes sick and is unable to bear more of the vision.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Dating of the 2300-Day/Year Prophecy</h3>

  <h4>a. Daniel’s Prayer</h4>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 9:1–19</em> – Daniel, deeply concerned, prays for Israel’s restoration, fearing extended desolation. He references <em>Jeremiah’s prophecy</em> about the 70 years ending (see <em>Jeremiah 25:11-12</em>).
  </p>

  <h4>b. Return of Gabriel</h4>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 9:20–23</em> – Gabriel returns to explain the unfulfilled portion of the previous vision, especially the time aspect.
  </p>

  <h4>c. The 70-Week Period</h4>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 9:24–27</em> – “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people...” The term “determined” means “cut off,” indicating that these 490 years are part of the longer 2300-year prophecy.
  </p>

  <h4>d. Dating the 70 Weeks</h4>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 9:25</em> – “From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem...”<br>
    The command of <strong>Artaxerxes</strong> in 457 B.C. is taken as the starting point. <br>
    <em>Ezra 7:11–26</em> – Provides the full decree that restored both civil and religious autonomy to the Jews. <br>
    <em>Ezra 7:8–9</em> – This decree was issued in the autumn of 457 B.C.
  </p>

  <h4>e. The Events of the 70 Weeks</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>First 7 Weeks (49 Years)</strong> – <em>Daniel 9:25</em>: Jerusalem rebuilt, ending in 408 B.C.</li>
    <li><strong>Next 62 Weeks (434 Years)</strong> – Ending in A.D. 27, the appearance of the Messiah.<br>
      <em>John 1:41</em> (margin) – “Messiah” means “Anointed One.”<br>
      <em>Acts 10:38</em> – “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost...”<br>
      <em>Mark 1:10</em> – Jesus was baptized and anointed by the Holy Spirit.<br>
      <em>Mark 1:15</em> – “The time is fulfilled...” referring to prophecy.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Final Week (7 Years)</strong> – From A.D. 27 to A.D. 34.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>4. The Crucifixion in the Midst of the Week</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 9:27</em> – “In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.”<br>
    Jesus died in A.D. 31, fulfilling this prophecy.
  </p>

  <h3>5. The Gospel to the Gentiles</h3>
  <p>
    In A.D. 34, special privileges to Israel ended. <br>
    <em>Acts 13:46</em> – “It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you... but seeing ye put it from you... lo, we turn to the Gentiles.”
  </p>

  <h3>6. The Remaining 1810 Years</h3>
  <p>
    2300 years – 490 years = 1810 years remaining.<br>
    Starting from A.D. 34 and adding 1810 years brings us to A.D. 1844.<br>
    This marks the beginning of the heavenly sanctuary cleansing, the final phase of Christ’s priestly ministry.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 8:14</em> – The sanctuary cleansing began in 1844.<br>
    This is a foundational belief in Adventist theology, helping explain the “Great Disappointment.”<br>
    <strong>GC 423</strong> – “The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disappointment of 1844.”
  </p>

            
            <!--
Lesson 20 – The Cleansing of the Sanctuary

This lesson, dated Saturday, November 25, 2023, focuses on the important biblical topic of the cleansing of the sanctuary. It begins by emphasizing that God operates according to a divine timetable. Ecclesiastes 3:1 tells us that there is a season and time for every purpose under heaven. Galatians 4:4 reminds us that when the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son to fulfill His divine plan.
The cleansing of the sanctuary marks the final phase of Christ’s priestly ministry. Daniel 8:14 says, “Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” Using the prophetic principle from Ezekiel 4:6 and Numbers 14:34, where a day represents a year, we understand that these 2300 days symbolize 2300 years.
Interestingly, in Daniel chapter 8, the 2300-day prophecy is not immediately explained. Gabriel explains the visions of the ram, goat, and little horn, but not the time period. Daniel becomes overwhelmed and sick, unable to hear more of the vision at that moment.
Later, in Daniel chapter 9, we find the key to understanding the timing. Daniel, concerned for his people, prays fervently for their restoration. He refers to Jeremiah’s prophecy that the desolation would last 70 years. In response to this prayer, Gabriel returns and begins to explain the unfulfilled part of the earlier vision, especially the time element.
Gabriel introduces the seventy-week prophecy found in Daniel 9:24–27. These seventy weeks, or 490 years, are “cut off” from the larger 2300-year prophecy. This period begins with the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem. That command was given by King Artaxerxes in 457 B.C., as recorded in Ezra 7. This decree granted the Jews both civil and religious autonomy and was issued in the autumn of that year.
The seventy weeks are then broken into three parts. The first 7 weeks, or 49 years, led to the rebuilding of Jerusalem, ending in 408 B.C. The next 62 weeks, or 434 years, bring us to A.D. 27—the appearance of the Messiah. This is the year Jesus was baptized and anointed with the Holy Spirit, as mentioned in Acts 10:38 and Mark 1. Jesus Himself declared, “The time is fulfilled,” referring to this prophecy.
The final week, a 7-year period, spans from A.D. 27 to A.D. 34. In the middle of this week, in A.D. 31, Jesus was crucified. Daniel 9:27 says that in the midst of the week, He would cause the sacrifice and offering to cease. Jesus' death fulfilled this prophecy, ending the need for animal sacrifices.
By A.D. 34, Israel's special role as the primary receiver of the gospel ended. As Paul and Barnabas later explained in Acts 13:46, the gospel was then directed to the Gentiles because many in Israel rejected it.
With the 490 years complete, 1810 years remained in the 2300-year prophecy. When added to A.D. 34, we reach the year 1844. According to Daniel 8:14, this marks the beginning of the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary—the final phase of Christ’s work as our High Priest.
In conclusion, this teaching forms a central part of Adventist theology. The event of 1844, though it initially led to the Great Disappointment, was clarified through the understanding of the heavenly sanctuary. As stated in The Great Controversy, page 423: “The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disappointment of 1844.”

  <h2>Lesson 21 - The Hour of Divine Judgment</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. A Definite Time Appointed</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible declares that a specific time has been set for the judgment:
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Acts 17:31 (KJV):</strong> "Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained..."
    </blockquote>
    Everyone will face judgment:
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Romans 14:10, 12 (KJV):</strong> "For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ... So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God."
    </blockquote>
    Even Christians will appear before Christ:
    <blockquote>
      <strong>2 Corinthians 5:10 (KJV):</strong> "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body..."
    </blockquote>
    The Bible outlines three phases of judgment:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Investigative Judgment:</strong> A review of the lives of those in the Book of Life before Jesus returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Review Judgment:</strong> Conducted in heaven by the redeemed during the millennium.</li>
      <li><strong>Executive Judgment:</strong> Final punishment or reward executed after the millennium.</li>
    </ul>
    When Jesus comes, He executes the decisions made:
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Revelation 22:12 (KJV):</strong> "And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."
    </blockquote>
    The timing of the judgment is tied to prophecy:
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Daniel 8:14 (KJV):</strong> "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
    </blockquote>

  <h3>2. Three Phases of Judgment Represented in Vision</h3>
  <p>Daniel's vision illustrates the investigative phase:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Daniel 7:9-10, 13-14 (KJV):</strong> "The judgment was set, and the books were opened... the Son of man came... and there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom..."
  </blockquote>
  <p>The saints are involved in the review phase:</p>
  <blockquote>

Lesson 21 - The Hour of Divine Judgment

A Definite Time Appointed
The Bible clearly teaches that a specific time has been appointed for judgment. In Acts 17:31, we are told that God "hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained." This means that judgment is not random or uncertain—there is a divine timeline.
Every person, without exception, will face judgment. Romans 14:10 and 12 remind us that "we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ... So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God." Even believers are not exempt. As 2 Corinthians 5:10 says, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body."
The Bible outlines three phases of judgment. First is the Investigative Judgment, where the lives of those in the Book of Life are reviewed before Jesus returns. Then comes the Review Judgment, conducted in heaven by the redeemed during the millennium. Finally, the Executive Judgment takes place after the millennium, where final rewards or punishments are given. Jesus will execute the decisions made during these phases when He returns. Revelation 22:12 states, "Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."
The timing of this judgment is linked to prophecy. In Daniel 8:14, we read, "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed," marking the start of the final judgment.

Three Phases of Judgment Represented in Vision
Daniel's vision gives us insight into the investigative phase. Daniel 7:9–10 and 13–14 describe a heavenly courtroom: "The judgment was set, and the books were opened... the Son of man came... and there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom."
The review phase is when the saints participate in judgment. Revelation 20:4 says, "And judgment was given unto them," and in 1 Corinthians 6:2–3, Paul writes, "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?... Know ye not that we shall judge angels?"
The executive phase happens at the end of the millennium and is described in Revelation 20:11–15 and Matthew 25:31–46. These passages reveal the final judgment scene when God passes ultimate sentence.

Classes of Persons in Judgment
There are three categories of people who will face judgment. First, the genuine believers; second, those who falsely profess faith; and third, those who have rejected God's grace entirely. Only those who are truly repentant will have their sins blotted out. Jesus teaches in Matthew 22:14, "Many are called, but few are chosen." Exodus 32:33 adds, "Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book."
For those who truly believe, Jesus acts as their representative. 1 John 2:1 comforts us with these words: "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." Revelation 3:5 assures us that Jesus will confess the names of faithful believers before His Father and the angels.

The Records of Judgment
God keeps detailed records of every person. Revelation 20:12 speaks of books being opened, including the Book of Life. Only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, as mentioned in Revelation 21:27, will enter the holy city.
God also remembers the good deeds of His people. Malachi 3:16 says, "A book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord." However, all sins—both public and secret—will be judged, as Ecclesiastes 12:14 explains: "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing."

Christ’s Place in the Judgment
Jesus has been appointed by God as the Judge of all the earth. Acts 17:30–31 tells us that He will "judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained." John 5:22 and 27 affirm that "the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son."

The Standard of Judgment
What will God use as the standard in the judgment? Our attitude toward Jesus Christ is key. In John 3:36, we are told, "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life." Ecclesiastes 12:13–14 urges us to "Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man." Jesus echoed this in John 14:15: "If ye love me, keep my commandments."

The Judgment-Hour Message
In the last days, a special message is being proclaimed to the whole world. Revelation 14:6–7 declares, "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come." This message, understood more fully after the year 1844, points to the beginning of the final judgment as prophesied in Daniel 8:14: "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
