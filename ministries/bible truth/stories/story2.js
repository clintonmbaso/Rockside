  <h2>Lesson 6 - God the Creator</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. God’s Creative Power</h3>
  <p>
    A defining characteristic of the true God is His unmatched creative power. He created all things by His word.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:1:</strong> “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”
    <br>
    This verse opens the Bible with a powerful declaration that all matter and life originate from God.

  </p>

  <h3>2. Jesus Christ’s Role in Creation</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus, the Word of God, was active in creation, sharing in divine creative authority.
    <br>
    <strong>John 1:1-3:</strong> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made.”
    <br>
    <strong>John 1:14:</strong> “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us...”
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 1:1-2:</strong> “God... has in these last days spoken to us by His Son... through whom also He made the worlds.”
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:2:</strong> “And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.”
    <br>
    <strong>Colossians 1:16-17:</strong> “For by Him all things were created... all things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.”
    <br>
    <strong>John 1:10:</strong> “He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, yet the world did not know Him.”
  </p>

  <h3>3. Creation and Redemption</h3>
  <p>
    The truth that God is the Creator is essential, because salvation (redemption) is essentially a new creation.
    <br>
    <strong>2 Corinthians 5:17:</strong> “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”
  </p>

  <h3>4. Redemption Begins with Re-Creation</h3>
  <p>
    The process of salvation begins with spiritual rebirth — a creative act of God.
    <br>
    <strong>John 3:3:</strong> “Jesus answered him, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.’”
  </p>

  <h3>5. Recognizing God as Creator</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible emphasizes the need to continually recognize and worship God as the Creator.
    <br>
    <strong>Exodus 20:8-11:</strong> “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day.”
    <br>
    The Sabbath serves as a weekly reminder that God is the Creator.
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 14:6-7:</strong> “Then I saw another angel... saying with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give Him glory... and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.’”
    <br>
    This is part of the final gospel message to the world, emphasizing worship of the Creator.
  </p>

  <h3>6. The Trinity in Creation</h3>
  <p>
    The Godhead — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — were all involved in creation.
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 1:1-2:</strong> “...through whom also He made the worlds.”
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:2:</strong> “And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.”
    <br>
    These verses show the active participation of the Father (as origin), the Son (as the agent), and the Holy Spirit (as the energizer) in creation.
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Recognizing God as Creator deepens our understanding of His authority, power, and role in salvation. The same power that formed the world is the power that transforms lives. Faith in God as Creator undergirds faith in His ability to re-create the human heart and bring about spiritual renewal.
  </p>

            
            <!--
Lesson 6: God the Creator

Today’s lesson focuses on God as the Creator. One of the defining characteristics of the true God is His unmatched creative power. He created all things by His word. In Genesis 1:1, we read, “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” This powerful opening to the Bible shows us that all matter and life have their origin in God.
Jesus Christ also played a vital role in creation. He is referred to as the Word of God, and He shared in divine creative authority. In John 1:1-3, we’re told, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... All things were made through Him.” Later, in John 1:14, it says, “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us...” Hebrews 1:1-2 explains that God made the worlds through His Son. Even in Genesis 1:2, we see the Holy Spirit’s presence: “And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.” Colossians 1:16-17 tells us that all things were created through Christ and for Him. In John 1:10, we’re reminded that the world was made through Him, yet the world did not recognize Him.
Understanding God as the Creator is not just about the past. It’s also central to our salvation, because redemption is a kind of new creation. Second Corinthians 5:17 says, “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”
This process of salvation begins with what we call spiritual rebirth — a creative act of God. In John 3:3, Jesus says, “Unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Just as God formed the world in the beginning, He also recreates hearts that turn to Him.
The Bible teaches us to continually recognize and worship God as the Creator. In Exodus 20:8-11, during the giving of the Ten Commandments, God says to remember the Sabbath day because, “in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth... and rested the seventh day.” This Sabbath is a weekly reminder of God's creative power. Revelation 14:6-7 speaks of a final message to the world, calling people to worship “Him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the springs of water.”
We also see that the Trinity — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — were all involved in creation. Hebrews 1:2 mentions that the worlds were made through the Son. Genesis 1:2 refers to the Spirit of God moving over the waters. Together, these verses reveal that the Father is the source, the Son is the agent, and the Holy Spirit is the energizer in the act of creation.
In closing, recognizing God as the Creator helps us understand His authority, His power, and His role in our salvation. The same power that created the world is the power that transforms lives. When we believe in God as Creator, we are also placing our faith in His ability to re-create our hearts and bring about spiritual renewal.

  <h2>Lesson 7 - The Creation of Our Earth</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Period of God’s Creative Work</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible teaches that God created the earth and the entire solar system in <strong>six literal days</strong>.
    <br>
    <strong>Exodus 20:11:</strong> “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.”
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 2:1-2:</strong> “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.”
  </p>
  <p>
    These verses affirm that God's work of creation was complete after six days, establishing the seven-day weekly cycle still observed today.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Manner of Creation</h3>
  <p>
    God did not depend on any pre-existing materials to create the world. Instead, He created everything <strong>out of nothing</strong> by the power of His word.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:1:</strong> “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”
    <br>
    The Hebrew word <em>bara’</em> (create) is used only of God and implies divine creation ex nihilo (out of nothing).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Psalm 33:6, 9:</strong> “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth... For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.”
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 11:3:</strong> “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The quote from <em>Testimonies for the Church, Volume 8, pages 258–259</em> states:  
    <br>
    <em>“In the formation of our world, God was not indebted to pre-existing matter. On the contrary, all things, material or spiritual, stood up before the Lord Jehovah at His voice and were created for His own purpose.”</em>
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Magnitude of God’s Creation</h3>
  <p>
    God's creative power extends to <strong>all things in existence</strong>, both visible and invisible.
    <br>
    <strong>Colossians 1:16:</strong> “For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible... all things were created by him, and for him.”
  </p>

  <h3>4. God’s Care of His Creation</h3>
  <p>
    God not only created the universe, but He continues to sustain and maintain it with intimate care.
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 147:4-5:</strong> “He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.”
    <br>
    This shows God's detailed awareness and understanding of the vast universe, far beyond human comprehension.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Colossians 1:17 (RSV):</strong> “He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.”
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 1:3 (RSV):</strong> “He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power.”
  </p>
  <p>
    These verses reveal that the universe is not held together by random forces, but by the sustaining word and will of God Himself.
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    This lesson emphasizes that belief in divine creation is both a theological and faith-based conviction. The Bible consistently portrays creation as an act of God’s sovereign power and wisdom. His word was sufficient to bring the entire universe into being, and His hand continues to guide and preserve it. The understanding of creation shapes our view of God’s nature—powerful, purposeful, and personal.
  </p>

            
            <!--
Lesson 7 - The Creation of Our Earth

The Bible teaches that God created the earth and the entire solar system in six literal days. This foundational truth is confirmed in Exodus 20:11, which says, “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” Likewise, Genesis 2:1-2 states, “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.” These verses show that God's creative work was complete after six days and established the seven-day weekly cycle we still observe today.
God’s method of creation was unique and unmatched. He did not rely on any pre-existing materials. Instead, He created everything out of nothing—by the sheer power of His word. Genesis 1:1 boldly declares, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” The Hebrew word used for “create” is bara’, a term used only of divine activity, which means creating out of nothing.
Psalm 33:6 and 9 reinforce this, saying, “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth... For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.” In the New Testament, Hebrews 11:3 tells us, “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.” This highlights how God’s spoken word brought the entire universe into being.
This truth is further affirmed in Testimonies for the Church, Volume 8, which says, “In the formation of our world, God was not indebted to pre-existing matter. On the contrary, all things, material or spiritual, stood up before the Lord Jehovah at His voice and were created for His own purpose.”
The scale of God’s creation is vast and awe-inspiring. His creative power extends beyond what we can see to include all invisible things. Colossians 1:16 explains, “For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible... all things were created by him, and for him.” Everything that exists owes its existence to God’s creative will and purpose.
But God’s role didn’t end with creation. He continues to care for and sustain the universe with personal attention. Psalm 147:4-5 says, “He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.” This reveals that God knows every star and every detail of His creation—His power and understanding are limitless.
In the New Testament, we read in Colossians 1:17 that “He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.” And Hebrews 1:3 reminds us that “He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power.” These verses make it clear that the universe is not held together by chance or natural forces alone, but by the ongoing word and will of God.
In conclusion, this lesson emphasizes that belief in divine creation is more than just a doctrine—it is a matter of faith. The Bible presents creation as a deliberate and powerful act of God. His word alone was enough to bring everything into existence. And not only did He create it all, but He continues to sustain and guide the universe. Understanding creation helps us grasp the nature of God—He is powerful, intentional, and intimately involved with all that He has made.

  <h2>Lesson 8 - The Creation of Man</h2>
  <p></p>
            
  <h3>1. God's Purpose in Creating the World</h3>
  <p>
    God created the world with a definite purpose, and that purpose centered on the creation of mankind.
    <br>
    <strong>Isaiah 45:18:</strong> “For thus says the Lord, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it empty, he formed it to be inhabited!): ‘I am the Lord, and there is no other.’”
  </p>
  <p>
    The first five days of creation were preparatory for the creation of man. On the sixth day:
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:26-28:</strong> “Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth...’”
  </p>
  <p>
    Humanity was created to reflect God's image in both form and character. The Bible states that only Christ is the express image of the Father (Hebrews 1:3), but man was made in God's likeness:
    <br>
    <em>“Man was to bear God’s image, both in outward resemblance and in character. Christ alone is ‘the express image’ of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God and in perfect obedience to His will.”</em> (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 45)
  </p>

  <h3>2. God’s Provision for Man’s Welfare</h3>
  <p>
    God created not only man but also made every provision for his well-being:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Food:</strong> 
      <br>
      <strong>Genesis 1:29:</strong> “And God said, ‘Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed... You shall have them for food.’”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Home:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Genesis 2:8:</strong> “And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Employment:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Genesis 2:15:</strong> “The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Companionship:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Genesis 2:18, 21-22:</strong> “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” … “So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man... And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Creation vs. Evolution</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible’s account of human origins is in direct contrast to evolutionary theories:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>a. Man was created as a distinct being:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Genesis 1:26-28:</strong> “Let us make man in our image... and let them have dominion...”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>b. Man began in God’s image, not from a lower state:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Psalm 8:5:</strong> “Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.”
      <br>
      <strong>Ecclesiastes 7:29:</strong> “See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>c. Man’s original home was Eden, not a cave:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Genesis 2:8-9:</strong> “The Lord God planted a garden... and out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree...”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>d. Man was created as a son of God:</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Luke 3:38:</strong> “…the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Christ Endorsed the Genesis Creation Account</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus affirmed the Genesis creation story during His earthly ministry:
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 19:4-8:</strong> “He answered, ‘Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female…’”
    <br>
    Jesus referred to the Genesis account as factual and authoritative, showing His belief in the divine origin of man.
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    Man's origin, nature, and purpose are clearly revealed in Scripture. Unlike evolutionary theories, the Bible teaches that mankind began with dignity, in the image of God, and with divine purpose. Understanding creation gives us a clearer sense of our value, identity, and calling in the world.
  </p>

            
            <!--
Lesson 8 - The Creation of Man

God created the world with a clear and definite purpose, and that purpose centered around the creation of mankind. According to Isaiah 45:18, the Lord, who formed the earth, did not create it to be empty, but to be inhabited. This reveals that from the beginning, the world was designed with humanity in mind.
The first five days of creation served as preparation for the creation of man, which took place on the sixth day. In Genesis 1:26-28, God says, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness," giving mankind dominion over the fish, birds, and all creatures on earth. Humanity was created to reflect God’s image in both form and character. While Christ alone is described as the express image of the Father in Hebrews 1:3, man was still formed in the likeness of God. As described in Patriarchs and Prophets, man’s nature was originally in harmony with God’s will—his mind was capable of understanding divine things, his affections were pure, and his desires were under the control of reason. He was both holy and happy, living in obedience to God’s will.
God didn’t just create man; He also provided for every aspect of human well-being. In Genesis 1:29, God provided food, saying, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed... You shall have them for food.” He gave man a home, as seen in Genesis 2:8, where the Lord planted a garden in Eden and placed the man there. God also gave man employment, a purpose—to work and care for the garden, as stated in Genesis 2:15. Finally, God provided companionship. In Genesis 2:18 and verses 21-22, the Lord said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” So God made a woman from man's rib and brought her to him.
The biblical account of creation stands in direct contrast to the theory of evolution. According to Scripture, man was created as a distinct being, not as a result of a long evolutionary process. Genesis 1:26-28 reaffirms that God created man in His image and gave him dominion. Psalm 8:5 reminds us that man was made just a little lower than the heavenly beings, crowned with glory and honor. Ecclesiastes 7:29 tells us that God made man upright, though mankind has pursued many wrong paths. Unlike evolutionary depictions of primitive humans in caves, Genesis 2:8-9 tells us that man’s original home was the beautiful Garden of Eden. Furthermore, in Luke 3:38, Adam is described as the son of God, highlighting the dignity and divine connection of humanity from the beginning.
Jesus Himself endorsed the Genesis creation account. In Matthew 19:4-8, He said, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?” Christ referred to Genesis as a factual, authoritative record, affirming that humanity was divinely created from the start.
In conclusion, man’s origin, nature, and purpose are clearly revealed in Scripture. The Bible teaches that mankind began not from chaos or chance, but with dignity and divine intent—in the image of God. Understanding our creation helps us better grasp our identity, value, and the purpose God has for each one of us in this world.

  <h2>Lesson 9 - The Memorial of Creation</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Institution of the Sabbath</h3>
  <p>
    The Sabbath was instituted at the close of creation week as outlined in <strong>Genesis 2:1-3</strong>:<br>
    <em>"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made."</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>God created</strong> everything in six days.</li>
    <li><strong>God rested</strong> on the seventh day.</li>
    <li><strong>God blessed</strong> the seventh day.</li>
    <li><strong>God sanctified</strong> the seventh day.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Exodus 20:8-11</strong> further emphasizes this commandment:<br>
    <em>"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."</em><br>
    The Sabbath reminds us that God is our Creator, and it is a universal memorial of His creative power.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Purpose of the Sabbath</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Mark 2:27</strong>:<br>
    <em>"The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath."</em><br>
    This shows that the Sabbath is for humanity’s benefit — spiritually and morally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, <strong>Exodus 20:8-11</strong> reminds us that the Sabbath is a <strong>memorial of creation</strong>. By observing it, we acknowledge God as Creator.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Revelation 14:6-7</strong>:<br>
    <em>"Fear God, and give glory to him... and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."</em><br>
    This calls all people to remember the Creator, linking directly to Sabbath observance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Exodus 31:13</strong>:<br>
    <em>"Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you."</em><br>
    <strong>Ezekiel 20:12</strong> adds:<br>
    <em>"Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    These verses reveal that the Sabbath is not just a sign of creation, but also of <strong>sanctification and redemption</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Results of Forgetting the Sabbath</h3>
  <p>
    When the Sabbath is forgotten, the knowledge of the true God as Creator is lost. <strong>Jeremiah 10:10-12</strong> says:<br>
    <em>"But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God... He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Isaiah 58</strong> is a chapter calling for <strong>Sabbath reform</strong>, reminding people to "call the sabbath a delight" (<strong>Isaiah 58:13</strong>), and to turn away from doing their own pleasure on God’s holy day.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Sabbath an Enduring Memorial</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Sabbath was instituted before sin entered the world, indicating its eternal purpose and significance.</li>
    <li>There is <strong>no biblical record of its abolition</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Luke 4:16</strong>:<br>
      <em>"And he came to Nazareth... and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Matthew 24:20</strong>:<br>
      <em>"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day."</em><br>
      Spoken by Jesus about the future, this shows the Sabbath's continued relevance.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Revelation 1:10</strong>:<br>
      <em>"I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day."</em><br>
      According to <strong>Mark 2:28</strong>, <em>"The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Isaiah 66:22-23</strong>:<br>
      <em>"... from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord."</em><br>
      This prophecy shows that the Sabbath will be observed even in the new earth.

Lesson 9 – The Memorial of Creation

1. The Institution of the Sabbath
The Sabbath was instituted at the very end of creation week, as described in Genesis 2:1-3. The Bible tells us that when God had finished His work, He rested on the seventh day. He then blessed and sanctified that day, setting it apart as holy. This act made the Sabbath a significant marker of creation itself. God created everything in six days, then rested, blessed, and made the seventh day holy.
This foundation is reaffirmed in the Ten Commandments, particularly in Exodus 20:8-11. Here, God commands His people to “remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” The reason given is that God Himself rested on the seventh day after creating the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them. This makes the Sabbath a universal memorial of God's creative power and authority.

2. The Purpose of the Sabbath
In Mark 2:27, Jesus says, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.” This shows that the Sabbath was created for the benefit of humanity. It’s not a burden, but a gift — providing spiritual, physical, and moral renewal.
The Sabbath reminds us of creation. Exodus 20:8-11 tells us that by observing the Sabbath, we acknowledge God as our Creator. This theme is echoed in Revelation 14:6-7, where we are called to worship the One who made heaven, earth, the sea, and the springs of water — another direct reference to creation.
God also uses the Sabbath as a sign of sanctification. In Exodus 31:13, He says, “Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep… that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.” Ezekiel 20:12 reinforces this by saying the Sabbaths are a sign that God is the one who makes us holy. So, the Sabbath serves not only as a sign of creation but also of our sanctification and redemption.
            
3. The Results of Forgetting the Sabbath
When people forget the Sabbath, they begin to lose the knowledge of the true God as Creator. Jeremiah 10:10-12 tells us that the Lord is the living God, the true God, and that He made the earth by His power and established the world by His wisdom.
Isaiah 58 is a strong call for Sabbath reform. It encourages people to honor the Sabbath by calling it a delight and by turning away from their own selfish pursuits on God’s holy day. This reminds us that the Sabbath is meant to be a joyful and sacred time with the Lord.
            
4. The Sabbath as an Enduring Memorial
The Sabbath was established before sin entered the world, showing that its purpose is eternal. There is no biblical record of its abolition. In fact, Jesus Himself kept the Sabbath, as shown in Luke 4:16, where it says that it was His custom to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath.
In Matthew 24:20, Jesus speaks about the Sabbath in a future context, advising His followers to pray that their flight would not be on the Sabbath day. This confirms its ongoing relevance even after His resurrection.
In Revelation 1:10, John says he was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day. And Mark 2:28 tells us that Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath, implying that the Sabbath is indeed the Lord’s Day. Finally, Isaiah 66:22-23 points to the future, declaring that in the new earth, from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before the Lord.
            
Conclusion
The Sabbath is a divine institution grounded in creation. It is reaffirmed in the Ten Commandments, honored by Jesus, and prophesied to continue in the future. It stands as a lasting sign of our relationship with God — reminding us that He is our Creator, our Redeemer, and our Sanctifier.

Lesson 10: The Trinity

Today, we are studying the doctrine of the Trinity. This teaching reveals that there are three distinct Persons in one Godhead—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are not the same, yet they are all fully God, and together they make up the one true God.
There Are Three Persons in the Trinity
In Matthew 28 verse 19, Jesus instructs His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. This passage clearly shows the presence of all three Persons of the Godhead.

1. The Father
The Godhead is eternal. In John chapter 1 verses 1 to 3, we read, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." This means that God has always existed. Genesis 1 tells us that in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and the Spirit of God was present at creation. Psalm 90 tells us that from everlasting to everlasting, God is God.
We also see that God the Father has personality. In Matthew chapter 3 verse 17, a voice from heaven says, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." In Psalm 3 verse 4, we see that God hears our prayers. Proverbs 15 verse 3 reminds us that the eyes of the Lord are everywhere, seeing both good and evil. And in John 3:16 and Romans 5:8, we read of God's great love for humanity.
The Father’s character is revealed through His attributes. 1 John 4:8 says that God is love. Deuteronomy 32:4 describes Him as just and perfect. In Exodus 34:6, God is described as merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and full of steadfast love. Hebrews 1:3 tells us He upholds the universe by the word of His power.
A quote from the book Testimonies for the Church reminds us that God has revealed Himself for us to study and understand, but there is a limit to human understanding: "No human mind can comprehend God."

2. Jesus
Jesus is the second Person of the Godhead. According to John 1, He existed from the beginning. First Timothy 3:16 speaks of the mystery of godliness and says that Jesus was manifested in the flesh. Hebrews 1:3 and verse 8 show that the Son is divine and eternal.
Philippians chapter 2 teaches that though Jesus was equal with God, He humbled Himself and took the form of a servant. Colossians 1 and Hebrews 1 tell us that all things were created through Him and for Him. In fact, the book Patriarchs and Prophets says that the Father worked through the Son in the creation of all beings.
Jesus came to earth to make the Father known. John 1:18 and John 14:9 show that seeing Jesus is like seeing the Father. Luke 19:10 tells us that Jesus came to seek and save the lost, and 1 Timothy 1:15 says He came into the world to save sinners. As The Desire of Ages says, “By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God.”
Through Christ, we receive life. First John 4:14 says the Father sent His Son to be the Savior of the world. John 1:12 reminds us that all who receive Him are given the right to become children of God.

3. The Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Godhead. As seen in Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14, He is presented alongside the Father and the Son. He plays a vital role in our lives and in the plan of salvation.
In John 16, Jesus explains that the Spirit convicts the world of sin and guides believers into all truth. Romans 5:5 says that God's love is poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. Romans 8:14 tells us that those led by the Spirit are sons of God. In John chapters 14 and 15, the Holy Spirit is called our Helper. And Romans 8:26 describes how the Spirit intercedes for us when we do not know what to pray.
The Spirit works quietly and mysteriously. John 3:8 compares the Spirit’s work to the wind—it’s invisible, but its effects are real. The Desire of Ages says that the Spirit’s work on the heart is as mysterious as the movement of the wind.
The Godhead desires to dwell in us. In John 14:16-17 and verse 23, Jesus says the Spirit of truth will live in us, and that He and the Father will come to make their home with us. This is echoed in 2 Corinthians 13:14, where we are blessed with the grace of Jesus, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
