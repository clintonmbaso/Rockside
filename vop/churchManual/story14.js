                <h2>Social Relationships</h2>
                <p>God gives us the social instinct for our pleasure and benefit. “By mutual 
contact minds receive polish and refinement; by social intercourse, 
acquaintances are formed and friendships contracted which result in a unity 
of heart and an atmosphere of love which is pleasing in the sight of 
heaven.”—6T 172.
Proper association of the sexes is beneficial to both. Such association 
should be conducted upon a high plane and with regard for the social 
conventions that have been prescribed for our protection. It is the purpose of 
Satan to pervert every good thing, and the perversion of the best often leads 
to that which is worst.
Today the ideals that make these social relationships safe and happy are 
breaking down to an alarming degree. Under the influence of passion 
unrestrained by moral and religious principle, the association of the sexes has 
to a large extent degenerated into freedom and license, sexual perversions, 
incest, and sexual abuse of children.
Millions have abandoned biblical standards of conduct and are bartering 
the sacred experiences of marriage and parenthood for the bitter, remorseful 
fruits of sin. Not only are these evils damaging the familial structure of 
society, but the breakdown of the family in turn fosters and breeds these and 
other evils. The results in distorted lives of children and youth are distressing. 
The effects on society are both disastrous and cumulative.
These evils have become more open and threatening to the ideals and 
purposes of the Christian home. Adultery, pornography, abuse of any kind 
(including sexual abuse of spouses, children, and the elderly), incest, and 
homosexual and lesbian practices are among the perversions of God’s 
original plan and illustrate the brokenness of humanity. As the intent of clear 
passages of Scripture (see Ex. 20:14; Lev. 18:22, 29; 20:13; 1 Cor. 6:9; 1 
Tim. 1:10; Rom. 1:20-32) is denied and as their warnings are rejected in 
exchange for human opinions, much uncertainty and confusion prevail. Since
ancient times and civilizations Satan’s plan always has been to cause people 
to forget that God is their Creator and that when He created humankind in 
His own image, He created both “male and female” (Gen. 1:27).
            
Though God’s Word alerts us to the degrading results of the world’s 
obsession with sex and the pursuit of sensual pleasure, Christ came to destroy 
the works of Satan and reestablish the relationship of humans with their 
Creator. Though fallen in Adam and captive to sin, when we are in Christ we 
receive full pardon and the right to choose anew the better way to complete 
renewal. By means of the cross and the power of the Holy Spirit, we all may 
be freed from the grip of sinful practices as we are restored to the image of 
our Creator.
As parents and spiritual guides of youth, we must gain a sympathetic 
understanding of their problems, seek to provide for them a Christian social 
environment, and spiritually draw near to them so we can impart the ideals, 
inspiration, and power of Christianity.
Whatever may be the mistakes of our parents or peers, it is our 
responsibility and privilege to know and to hold the highest ideals of 
Christian manhood and womanhood. We can build Christian character that 
will buttress us against evil and make us uplifting influences in society by 
reverent Bible study, a deep acquaintance with the works of nature, rigorous 
guarding of the sacred powers of the body, earnest purpose, constancy in 
prayer, and sincere, unselfish ministry to others.
Social gatherings for both young and old should be occasions for happy 
fellowship and improvement of the powers of mind and soul, not for light and 
trifling amusement. Good music, elevating conversation, good recitations, 
suitable still or motion pictures, games carefully selected for educational
value, and, above all, the making and using of plans for outreach (missionary) 
effort will bless and strengthen the lives of all. The Youth Ministries 
Department of the General Conference has published helpful information and 
practical suggestions for the conduct of social gatherings and for guidance in 
other social relations.
Our homes are by far the best places for social gatherings. In large 
centers where it is impossible to hold such gatherings in homes and where 
there is no social center of our own, we should secure a place free from 
influences destructive of Christian standards, rather than a place ordinarily
used for commercial amusements and sports, such as social halls and skating
rinks, which can suggest an atmosphere contrary to Christian standards.

                <h2>Chaperonage</h2>
                <p>Chaperonage, the happy and cordial association of those older in years
with young people, is one of the most wholesome influences in the lives of 
children and youth. “There is danger that both parents and teachers . . . fail to 
come sufficiently into social relation with their children or scholars.”— CT 
76. It is the duty of our homes, schools, and other institutions to care for the 
morals and reputation of those placed in our charge. As parents we should 
strongly support the regulations of the institutions serving our youth and 
children, and we should institute equal safeguards in our homes. To make this 
possible, we must learn how to be welcome companions of our children. But 
it rests chiefly upon the young people themselves to make chaperonage an 
honored and happy relationship.

                <h2>Courtship</h2>
                <p>Courtship is recognized as a preparatory period during which a man and 
a woman, already mutually attracted, become more thoroughly acquainted 
with each other in preparation for intended marriage.
“Let those who are contemplating marriage weigh every sentiment and 
watch every development of character in the one with whom they think to 
unite their life destiny. Let every step toward a marriage alliance be 
characterized by modesty, simplicity, sincerity, and an earnest purpose to 
please and honor God. Marriage affects the afterlife both in this world and in 
the world to come. A sincere Christian will make no plans that God cannot 
approve.”—MH 359.
Failure to follow these principles in Christian courtship may lead to 
tragedy. Unity of husband and wife in ideals and purposes is a requisite to a 
happy and successful home. Differences of partners regarding religion are 
likely to mar the happiness of the home and lead to confusion, perplexity, and 
failure in child rearing. The Bible advises, “Do not be unequally yoked 
together with unbelievers” (2 Cor. 6:14).
“The family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred, of any on earth. 
It was designed to be a blessing to mankind. And it is a blessing wherever the 
marriage covenant is entered into intelligently, in the fear of God, and with 
due consideration for its responsibilities.”—AH 18.
Worship of God, Sabbathkeeping, recreation, association, use of 
financial resources, and training of children are components of happy family 
relationships. Because differences in these areas can often lead to a 
deterioration of these relationships, to discouragement, and even to complete 
loss of Christian experience, an adequate preparation for marriage should 
include premarital pastoral counseling in these areas.
“‘Can two walk together, except they be agreed?’ Amos 3:3. The 
happiness and prosperity of the marriage relation depends upon the unity of 
the parties; but between the believer and the unbeliever there is a radical 
difference of tastes, inclinations, and purposes. They are serving two masters, 
between whom there can be no concord. However pure and correct one’s 
principles may be, the influence of an unbelieving companion will have a 
tendency to lead away from God.”—PP 174.
The Spirit of Prophecy consistently counsels against marriage between 
“the believer and the unbeliever” and further cautions against uniting with 
fellow Christians who have “not accepted the truth for this time.”—5T 364. 
Marriages are more likely to endure, and family life to fulfill the divine plan, 
if husband and wife are united and are bound together by common spiritual 
values and lifestyles. For these reasons the Church strongly discourages 
marriage between a Seventh-day Adventist and a member of another religion 
and strongly urges its pastors not to perform such marriages.
The Church recognizes that it is the prerogative of each individual 
member to make the final decision relative to the choice of a marriage partner. 
However, it is the hope of the Church that if the member chooses a partner 
who is not a member of the Church, the couple will realize and appreciate 
that the Seventh-day Adventist pastor, who has covenanted to uphold the 
principles outlined above, should not be expected to perform the marriage.
If a member does enter into such a marriage, the church is to demonstrate 
love and concern with the purpose of encouraging the couple toward 
complete unity in Christ.

                <h2>Premarital Education/Counseling</h2>
                <p>Considering that marriage is the most important and challenging of all 
relationships, premarital education/counseling is designed to help couples 
planning to marry to be better prepared for this important step in their lives. 
The main purpose of premarital education/counseling is to prepare couples 
for the challenges they will encounter in married life. Premarital 
education/counseling is also to strengthen and improve the future happiness 
of married couples and reduce the potential rate of divorce. Premarital 
education/counseling should be offered by a professional counselor or 
specifically trained individuals, including specifically trained spiritual
leaders. (For more detailed information regarding premarital 
education/counseling see the Elder’s Handbook.)

                <h2>Marriage</h2>
                <p>Marriage is a divine institution established by God Himself before the 
Fall, when everything, including marriage, was “very good” (Gen. 1:31). 
“Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, 
and they shall become one flesh” (Gen. 2:24). “God celebrated the first 
marriage. Thus the institution has for its originator the Creator of the 
universe. ‘Marriage is honourable’; it was one of the first gifts of God to man, 
and it is one of the two institutions that, after the fall, Adam brought with him 
beyond the gates of Paradise.”—AH 25, 26.
God intended the marriage of Adam and Eve to be the pattern for all 
future marriages, and Christ endorsed this original concept: “Have you not 
read that He who made them at the beginning ‘made them male and female,’ 
and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be 
joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So then, they are no
longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man 
separate” (Matt. 19:4-6). Marriage, thus instituted by God, is a monogamous, 
heterosexual relationship between one male and one female.
As such, marriage is a public, lawfully binding lifelong commitment of 
a man and a woman to each other and between the couple and God 
(Mark 10:2-9; Rom. 7:2). Paul indicates that the commitment that Christ has 
for the church is a model of the relationship between husband and wife (Eph. 
5:31, 32). God intended marriage to be as permanent as Christ’s relationship 
with the church.
Sexual intimacy within marriage is a sacred gift from God to the human 
family. It is an integral part of marriage, reserved for marriage only 
(Gen. 2:24; Prov. 5:5-20). Such intimacy, designed to be shared exclusively 
between husband and wife, promotes ever-increasing closeness, happiness, 
and security, and provides for the perpetuation of the human race.
Unity in marriage is achieved by mutual respect and love. No one is 
superior (Eph. 5:21-28). “Marriage, a union for life, is a symbol of the union 
between Christ and His church. The spirit that Christ manifests toward the 
church is the spirit that husband and wife are to manifest toward each 
other.”—7T 46. God’s Word condemns violence in personal relationships 
(Gen. 6:11, 13; Ps. 11:5; Isa. 58:4, 5; Rom. 13:10; Gal. 5:19-21). It is the 
spirit of Christ to love and accept, to seek to affirm and build others up, rather 
than to abuse or demean them (Rom. 12:10; 14:19; Eph. 4:26; 5:28, 29; Col. 
3:8-14; 1 Thess. 5:11). There is no room among Christ’s followers for 
tyrannical control and the abuse of power (Matt. 20:25-28; Eph. 6:4). 
Violence in the setting of marriage and family is abhorrent (see AH 343).
“Neither husband nor wife is to make a plea for rulership. The Lord has 
laid down the principle that is to guide in this matter. The husband is to 
cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the church. And the wife is to respect and 
love her husband. Both are to cultivate the spirit of kindness, being 
determined never to grieve or injure the other.”—7T 47.
The entrance of sin adversely affected marriage. When Adam and Eve 
sinned, they lost the oneness that they had known with God and with each 
other (Gen. 3:6-24). Their relationship became marked with guilt, shame, 
blame, and pain. Wherever sin reigns, its sad effects on marriage include 
alienation, unfaithfulness, neglect, abuse, sexual perversion, domination of 
one partner by the other, violence, separation, desertion, and divorce.
Marriages involving more than one husband and one wife are also an 
expression of the effects of sin on the institution of marriage. Such marriages, 
though practiced in Old Testament times, are not in harmony with the divine 
design. God’s plan for marriage requires His people to transcend the mores 
of popular culture that conflict with the biblical view.
The Christian concept of marriage includes the following:
1. Divine Ideal to Be Restored in Christ—In redeeming the world from 
sin and its consequences, God seeks to restore marriage to its original ideal. 
This is envisioned for the lives of those who have been born again into 
Christ’s kingdom, those whose hearts are being sanctified by the Holy Spirit 
and who have as their primary purpose the exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
(See also 1 Peter 3:7; TMB 64.)
2. Oneness and Equality to Be Restored in Christ—The gospel 
emphasizes the love and submission of husband and wife to one another 
(1 Cor. 7:3, 4; Eph. 5:21). The model for the husband’s leadership is the selfsacrificial love and service that Christ gives to the Church (Eph. 5:24, 25). 
Both Peter and Paul speak about the need for respect in the marriage 
relationship (1 Peter 3:7; Eph. 5:22, 23).
3. Grace Available for All—God seeks to restore to wholeness and 
reconcile to Himself all who have failed to attain the divine standard 
(2 Cor. 5:19). This includes those who have experienced broken marriage 
relationships.
4. Role of the Church—Moses in the Old Testament and Paul in the 
New Testament dealt with the problems caused by broken marriages 
(Deut. 24:1-5; 1 Cor. 7:11). Both, while upholding and affirming the ideal, 
worked constructively and redemptively with those who had fallen short of 
the divine standard. Similarly, the Church today is called to uphold and affirm 
God’s ideal for marriage and, at the same time, to be a forgiving, reconciling, 
healing community, showing understanding and compassion when 
brokenness occurs.

                <h2>Divorce</h2>
                <p>Divorce is contrary to God’s original purpose in creating marriage (Matt. 
19:3-8; Mark 10:2-9), but the Bible is not silent about it. Because divorce 
occurred as part of the fallen human experience, biblical legislation was given 
to limit the damage it caused (Deut. 24:1-4). The Bible consistently seeks to 
elevate marriage and to discourage divorce by describing the joys of married 
love and faithfulness (Prov. 5:18-20; Song of Sol. 2:16; 4:9-5:1), by referring 
to the marriage-like relationship of God with His people (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:1), 
by focusing on the possibilities of forgiveness and marital renewal (Hosea 
3:1-3), and by indicating God’s abhorrence of divorce and the misery it 
causes (Mal. 2:15, 16). Jesus restored the creation view of marriage as a 
lifelong commitment between a man and a woman and between the couple 
and God (Matt. 19:4-6; Mark 10:6-9). Much biblical instruction affirms 
marriage and seeks to correct problems that tend to weaken or destroy the 
foundation of marriage (Eph. 5:21-33; Heb. 13:4; 1 Peter 3:7).
Marriage rests on principles of love, loyalty, exclusiveness, trust, and 
support upheld by both partners in obedience to God (Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:6; 
1 Cor. 13; Eph. 5:21-29; 1 Thess. 4:1-7). When these principles are violated, 
Scripture acknowledges that tragic circumstances can destroy marriage.
Divine grace is the only remedy for the brokenness of divorce. When 
marriage fails, former partners should be encouraged to examine their 
experience and to seek God’s will for their lives. God provides comfort to 
those who have been wounded. God also accepts the repentance of 
individuals who commit the most destructive sins, even those that carry with 
them irreparable consequences (2 Sam. 11; 12; Ps. 34:18; 86:5; Joel 2:12, 13; 
John 8:2-11; 1 John 1:9).
Scripture recognizes adultery and fornication (Matt. 5:32) and 
abandonment by an unbelieving partner (1 Cor. 7:10-15) as grounds for 
divorce.
There is no direct teaching in Scripture regarding remarriage after 
divorce. However, there is a strong implication in Jesus’ words in 
Matthew 19:9 that would allow the remarriage of one who has remained 
faithful but whose spouse has been unfaithful to the marriage vow.

                <h2>Church’s Position on Divorce and Remarriage</h2>
                <p>Acknowledging the biblical teachings on marriage, the Church is aware 
that marriage relationships are less than ideal in many cases. The problem of 
divorce and remarriage can be seen in its true light only as it is viewed from 
Heaven’s viewpoint and against the background of the Garden of Eden.
Central to God’s holy plan for our world was the creation of beings made 
in His image who would multiply and replenish the earth and live together in 
purity, harmony, and happiness. He brought forth Eve from the side of Adam 
and gave her to Adam as his wife. Thus was marriage instituted—God the 
author of the institution and the officiator at the first marriage. After the Lord 
had revealed to Adam that Eve was verily bone of his bone and flesh of his 
flesh, there could never arise a doubt in his mind that the two of them were 
one flesh. Nor could ever a doubt arise in the mind of either of the holy pair 
that God intended that their home should endure forever.
The Church adheres to this view of marriage and the home without 
reservation, believing that any lowering of this high view is to that extent a 
lowering of the heavenly ideal. The belief that marriage is a divine institution 
rests upon the Holy Scriptures. Accordingly, all thinking and reasoning in the 
perplexing field of divorce and remarriage must constantly be harmonized 
with that holy ideal revealed in Eden.
The Church believes in the law of God and also in the forgiving mercy 
of God. It believes that victory and salvation can as surely be found by those 
who have transgressed in the matter of divorce and remarriage as by those 
who have failed in any other of God’s holy standards.
Nothing presented here is intended to minimize the mercy of God or the 
forgiveness of God. In the fear of the Lord, the Church here sets forth the 
principles and practices that should apply in this matter of marriage, divorce, 
and remarriage.
Though marriage was first performed by God alone, it is recognized that 
people now live under civil governments; therefore, marriage has both divine 
and civil aspects. The divine aspect is governed by the laws of God, the civil 
by the laws of the state.
In harmony with these teachings, the following statements set forth the 
position of the Church:
1. When Jesus said, “Let not man put asunder,” He established a rule 
of conduct for the Church, under the dispensation of grace, that must 
transcend all civil enactments that would go beyond His interpretation of the 
divine law governing the marriage relation. Here He gives a rule to which His 
followers should adhere even if the state or prevailing custom allows larger 
liberty. “In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus declared plainly that there could 
be no dissolution of the marriage tie, except for unfaithfulness to the marriage 
vow.”—TMB 63. (Also see Matt. 5:32; 19:9.)
2. Unfaithfulness to the marriage vow has generally been seen to mean 
adultery or fornication. However, the New Testament word for fornication 
includes certain other sexual irregularities (1 Cor. 6:9; 1 Tim. 1:9, 10; Rom.
1:24-27). Therefore, sexual perversions, including incest, child sexual abuse, 
and homosexual practices, are also recognized as a misuse of sexual powers 
and a violation of the divine intention in marriage. As such they are just cause 
for separation or divorce.
Even though the Scriptures allow divorce for the reasons mentioned 
above, as well as for abandonment by an unbelieving spouse 
(1 Cor. 7:10-15), the church and those concerned should make earnest 
endeavors to effect a reconciliation, urging the spouses to manifest toward 
each other a Christlike spirit of forgiveness and restoration. The church is 
urged to relate lovingly and redemptively toward the couple in order to assist 
in the reconciliation process.
3. In the event that reconciliation is not effected, the spouse who has 
remained faithful to the spouse who violated the marriage vow has the 
biblical right to secure a divorce and also to remarry.
4. A spouse who has violated the marriage vow (see sections 1 and 2 
above) shall be subject to discipline by the local church. (See pp. 67-73.) If 
genuinely repentant, the spouse may be placed under censure for a stated 
period of time rather than removed from church membership. A spouse who 
gives no evidence of full and sincere repentance shall be removed from 
membership. In case the violation has brought public reproach on the cause 
of God, the church, in order to maintain its high standards and good name, 
may remove the individual from membership.
Any of these forms of discipline shall be applied by the church in a 
manner that would seek to attain the two objectives of discipline—to correct 
and redeem. In the gospel of Christ, the redemptive side of discipline is 
always tied to an authentic transformation of the sinner into a new creature in 
Jesus Christ.
5. A spouse who has violated the marriage vow and who is divorced 
does not have the moral right to marry another while the spouse who has been 
faithful to the marriage vow still lives and remains unmarried and chaste. The 
person who does so shall be removed from membership. The person whom 
he/she marries, if a member, also shall be removed from membership.
6. It is recognized that sometimes marriage relations deteriorate to the 
point where it is better for a husband and wife to separate. “Now to the 
married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from her 
husband. But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be 
reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife” 
(1 Cor. 7:10, 11). In many such cases, the custody of children, the adjustment 
of property rights, or even personal protection may necessitate a change in 
marital status. In such cases it may be permissible in some countries to secure 
what is known as a legal separation. However, in some jurisdictions such a 
separation can be secured only by divorce.
A separation or divorce that results from factors such as physical 
violence or in which “unfaithfulness to the marriage vow” (see sections 1 and
2 above) is not involved does not give either one the scriptural right to 
remarry, unless in the meantime the other party has remarried, committed 
adultery or fornication, or died. Should a member who has been thus divorced 
remarry without these biblical grounds, he/she shall be removed from 
membership, and the one whom he/she marries, if a member, also shall be 
removed from membership. (See pp. 67-73.)
7. A spouse who has violated the marriage vow and has been divorced 
and removed from membership and who has remarried, or a person who has 
been divorced on other than the grounds set forth in sections 1 and 2 above
and has remarried, and who has been removed from membership, shall be 
considered ineligible for membership except as provided below.
8. The marriage contract is not only sacred but also possibly more 
complex when, for example, it involves children. Hence, in a request for 
readmittance to membership, the options available to the repentant may be 
severely limited. Before final action is taken by the church, the request for 
readmittance shall be brought by the church through the pastor or district 
leader to the conference executive committee for counsel and 
recommendation of steps the repentant one, or ones, may take to secure 
readmittance.
9. Readmittance to membership of those who have been removed for 
reasons given in the foregoing sections shall normally be on the basis of 
rebaptism. (See pp. 55, 72-73.)
10. When a person who has been removed from membership is 
readmitted to membership, as provided in section 8, every care should be 
exercised to safeguard the unity and harmony of the church by not giving that 
person responsibility as a leader, especially in an office that requires the rite 
of ordination, unless by very careful counsel with conference administration.
11. No pastor has the right to officiate at the remarriage of any person 
who, under the stipulation of the preceding paragraphs, has no scriptural right 
to remarry.

                <h2>Local Church Ministry for Families</h2>
                <p>The Church as a redemptive agency of Christ is to minister to its 
members in all of their needs and to nurture everyone so that all may grow 
into a mature Christian experience. This is particularly true when members 
face lifelong decisions such as marriage and distressful experiences such as 
divorce. When a couple’s marriage is in danger of breaking down, every 
effort should be made by the partners and those in the church or family who 
minister to them to bring about their reconciliation in harmony with divine 
principles for restoring wounded relationships (Hosea 3:1-3; 1 Cor. 7:10, 11; 
13:4-7; Gal. 6:1).
Resources that can be of assistance to members in the development of a 
strong Christian home are available through the church or other church 
organizations. These resources include: (1) programs of orientation for 
couples engaged to be married, (2) programs of instruction for married 
couples with their families, and (3) programs of support for broken families 
and divorced individuals.
Pastoral support is vital in the area of instruction and orientation in the 
case of marriage, and healing and restoration in the case of divorce. The
pastoral function in the latter case is both disciplinary and supportive. That 
function includes the sharing of relevant information, some of which may be 
sensitive and must be handled with great discretion. However, this ethical 
concern alone should not be the grounds for avoiding disciplinary actions 
established in sections 1-11 above.
Just as God forgives, members are called to forgive and to accept those 
who have failed (Isa. 54:5-8; Matt. 6:14, 15; Eph. 4:32). The Bible urges 
patience, compassion, and forgiveness in the Christian care of those who have 
erred (Matt. 18:10-20; Gal. 6:1, 2). While individuals are under discipline, 
either by censure or by being removed from membership, the church, as an 
instrument of God’s mission, shall make every effort to maintain caring and 
spiritually nurturing contact with them.
