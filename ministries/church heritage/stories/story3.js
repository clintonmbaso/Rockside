<h2>Three Spectacular Signs</h2>

<p>During this time period, numerous spectacular signs appeared in the natural world, which were interpreted by theologians and secular media alike as portents of grave things to come — maybe even the second coming of Christ.</p>

<h3>The Lisbon Earthquake (1755)</h3>

<p>The first of these, in <strong>1755</strong>, is known as the <strong>Lisbon Earthquake</strong> due to the massive destruction caused in that city — a tragedy still remembered by its citizens. The earthquake was so powerful that it was felt as far away as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Scandinavia</li>
    <li>Greenland</li>
    <li>The West Indies</li>
</ul>

<p>It covered a region of more than <strong>four million square miles</strong> (6.4 million square kilometers). This earthquake was seen as a clear fulfillment of the prophecy connected to the opening of the sixth seal in <em>Revelation 6:12-13</em>.</p>

<h3>The Dark Day (1780)</h3>

<p>In <strong>1780</strong>, twenty-five years later, the second prophecy-fulfilling event took place, as predicted by Jesus and recorded in <em>Mark 13:24</em>. The 1260-year period referred to as “those days” ended in <strong>1798</strong>, but the persecution was cut short before the close of that time prophecy. This was due to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The decree of Empress Maria Theresa</li>
    <li>The Acts of Toleration (1773–1776)</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the sign would occur after those dates and before 1798. This prophecy came true with the <strong>Dark Day of May 19, 1780</strong>. Newspapers of the time reported the unusual circumstances of this event, which occurred over the northeastern United States. Noah Webster later wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
    “No satisfactory reason has ever been given to explain the reason for this darkness.”
</blockquote>

<p>Eyewitnesses described the night of May 19, stating that even though there was a full moon:</p>

<blockquote>
    “If every luminous body in the universe had been struck out of existence, the darkness could not have been more complete.”
</blockquote>

<h3>The Meteorite Showers (1833)</h3>

<p>The third sign occurred twice:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>November 13, 1833</strong> — in the Western Hemisphere</li>
    <li><strong>November 25, 1833</strong> — over Europe</li>
</ul>

<p>These incredible meteorite showers were described by one newspaper as:</p>

<blockquote>
    “The likes of which have never been seen in the annals of recorded history.”
</blockquote>

<p>The first shower was witnessed across a vast area, from:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Hawaii to the mid-Atlantic</li>
    <li>Hudson Bay, Canada, to northern South America</li>
</ul>

<p>Observers described it as:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Streams of fire coming down from heaven” and “falling as thick as snowflakes in a snow-storm.”
</blockquote>

<p>The second shower on November 25 was just as awe-inspiring:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Like a rain of fire... making the night so light that the people thought that the houses near them must be on fire.”
</blockquote>

<p>The event was so intense that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Horses were frightened and fell to the ground.</li>
    <li>Many people became sick with fear.</li>
</ul>

<p>This event was seen as the fulfillment of the prophecy in <em>Revelation 6:13</em>.</p>

<h3>Impact on the Advent Message</h3>

<p>These three spectacular signs in the natural world — placed by God to draw attention to the truth — gave great momentum to the preaching of the <strong>Advent message</strong>.</p>

<h2>Three Special Angels</h2>

<p>To symbolize the moment in the great clock of historical time for the delivery of the last warning message to a perishing world, God chose <strong>three mighty angels</strong>. God could have literally sent celestial beings in person to appear on earth in dazzling splendor and have them shout the messages from the mountaintops, but this was not His plan. Instead, the members of the church of God in our time have been entrusted with the messages, and the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong> gives the power to proclaim these messages to the world.</p>

<h3>Summary of the Three Angels' Messages</h3>

<p>There are many doctrines contained in the three angels' messages, but they may be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The first angel’s message</strong> calls to give allegiance to God, the Creator of the heavens and earth, and warns that <strong>the judgment hour has come</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>The second angel’s message</strong> declares that <strong>spiritual Babylon has fallen</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>The third angel’s message</strong> warns men and women living in the time of the remnant church against <strong>receiving the mark of the beast</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Importance of Daniel and Revelation</h3>

<p>The books of <strong>Daniel</strong> and <strong>Revelation</strong> have special significance for the last period of the world’s history and should be studied carefully by those living in these times. The three angels' messages of <strong>Revelation 14</strong> summarize some of the special teachings of these books. They are to be heralded by the members of the remnant church so that those living in the last days can <strong>decide for truth</strong> and not be caught in the deceptions of tradition.</p>

<h2>Advent Ambassadors in America</h2>
<p>These are the people that worked in America to preach the second coming of Christ.</p>
<h3>1. William Miller (1782–1849)</h3>

<p>(A biography is given in the book <em>Herald of the Midnight Cry</em> by Paul Gordon, Pacific Press, 1990. The complete biography was written by Sylvester Bliss in 1853, <em>Memoirs of William Miller</em>, and is still available in reprint form).</p>

<p>During the first half of the nineteenth century, the most prominent American preacher of the second coming of Christ was <strong>William Miller</strong>. The eldest of a family of sixteen, Miller received what would be termed a “good education,” but his curiosity and desire for knowledge led him to study for himself.</p>

<p>Later, due to his association with unbelievers in political circles, he became a <em>deist</em>, though not fully persuaded, still retaining some hold on the Bible. Miraculously, he transitioned from deism to full faith in God and the Bible. To vindicate his new faith, he studied for years, becoming convinced of the nearness of the Advent.</p>

<h4>His Journey to Preaching</h4>

<p>He studied for fifteen years, from 1816 to 1831, growing more convinced that he should share his discoveries. Almost fifty years old and without public speaking training, he resisted at first. However, in August 1831, he made a covenant with God to preach if given an opportunity.</p>

<blockquote>
    “The minister of the Baptist church was away, and could William come and preach tomorrow on the subject of the second coming?”
</blockquote>

<p>From that point on, he began preaching, first in rural areas, then in larger towns and cities, until more than <strong>100,000</strong> had accepted the message of a soon-coming Saviour.</p>

<h4>Key Events and Messages</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The Dark Day:</strong> May 19, 1780 — a sign of the second coming</li>
    <li><strong>Falling of the stars:</strong> November 13, 1833</li>
    <li><strong>Daniel's prophecy:</strong> He studied the 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8 and 9 and believed it referred to the cleansing of the earth by fire at Christ's second coming.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although Miller spoke about the second coming, he only accepted a definite date in late 1844. In January 1843, he stated Christ would come between March 1843 and March 1844.</p>

<h4>Challenges and Legacy</h4>

<p>Many ministers initially supported the Advent message, but by late 1843, opposition grew. Advent believers were disfellowshipped, including Robert Harmon and his family. By 1844, the popular churches had rejected the first angel’s message.</p>

<p>When Jesus did not come in 1843–44, Miller's faith remained steadfast. His public ministry ended in 1845, and he died in 1849, still confident in the Saviour’s return.</p>

<h4>William Miller's Impact</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Preached more than <strong>3,000 lectures</strong> in nearly 1,000 places.</li>
    <li>Though blind by 1848, his name became inseparable from the Advent movement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Miller was called the <strong>“Morning Star”</strong> of the Advent movement because:</p>

<ol>
    <li>He recommended preaching the first angel’s message.</li>
    <li>His preaching was so impactful that the movement was known as <strong>Millerism</strong>, and his followers were called <strong>Millerites</strong>.</li>

<h3>2. Joshua V. Himes (1805–1895)</h3>
<p>In November 1839, fifty-seven-year-old Miller met thirty-five-year-old <strong>Joshua V. Himes</strong> at Exeter, New Hampshire. By December, Miller preached at Himes’ church in Boston, converting many, including Himes himself.</p>

<blockquote>
    “I laid myself, family, society, reputation, all, upon that altar of God, to help him, to the extent of my power, to the end.” — Joshua V. Himes
</blockquote>

<h4>Contributions</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Publishing:</strong> Founded <em>Signs of the Times</em> in Boston (1840).</li>
    <li><strong>Media:</strong> Published <em>The Midnight Cry</em> (1842), with a daily circulation of 10,000 copies.</li>
    <li><strong>Events:</strong> Organized camp meetings attended by thousands to spread the Advent message.</li>
</ul>

<p>Himes was a bold leader and promoter of the Millerite movement. Although he did not join the Seventh-day Adventists after the 1844 disappointment, he maintained his faith in the Advent message until his death in 1895.</p>

<h3>3. Josiah Litch</h3>
<p>Among the 200 ministers and 500 lecturers who joined Miller was <strong>Josiah Litch</strong>. A Methodist minister from the age of seventeen, he first read Miller’s work in 1838, intending to refute it.</p>

<blockquote>
    “Before concluding the book I became satisfied that the arguments were so clear and that they were so scriptural that it was impossible to disprove the position which Mr. Miller had endeavored to establish.” — Josiah Litch

<h3>4. Charles Fitch</h3>
<p><strong>Charles Fitch</strong> was a Congregational church pastor in Boston who embraced the Advent message after reading Miller’s lectures. His contributions were fourfold:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preacher:</strong> His key message was <em>“Prepare to meet thy God.”</em></li>
    <li><strong>Writer:</strong> Published <em>Second Advent of Christ</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Hymn writer:</strong> Wrote hymns, including <em>One Precious Boon, O Lord, I Seek</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Artist:</strong> Created the first prophetic charts (1842) — an early use of audiovisual aids in evangelism.</li>
</ol>

<p>Fitch died on October 14, 1844, just eight days before the expected Advent date, after falling ill from baptizing believers in cold waters.</p>
            

<h3>5. Among Many Others</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sylvester Bliss:</strong> Authored William Miller’s memoirs (1853).</li>
    <li><strong>S. S. Snow:</strong> Corrected the prophecy date to the fall of 1844.</li>
    <li><strong>James White:</strong> At 21, he preached on horseback and converted over 1,000 people in three months.</li>

<h2>Advent Ambassadors in Other Countries</h2>

<p>The Advent movement began at the same time in both Europe and America as men of God were led to study the prophecies of the Bible. It was providential that Christians in various lands studied the Scriptures and arrived at the belief that Jesus was coming soon. We list here only a few of the more prominent ones:</p>

<h3>1. Joseph Wolff</h3>

<p>From 1821 to 1845, Joseph Wolff traveled in Africa, Syria, Persia, India, the United States — even to the island of St. Helena. He preached to rulers and paupers alike. One of the world’s most noted missionary travelers and language students, Joseph Wolff became known as the <strong>"missionary to the world."</strong></p>

<p>Born in Bavaria, Joseph was the son of a Jewish rabbi. At eleven years of age, he left home seeking an education so that he might become a missionary. He was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church but very soon challenged the authority of the church on doctrine and dogma.</p>

<p>Wolff spoke <strong>fourteen languages</strong>, which allowed him great ease with dignitaries and common folk alike. His travels in Asia and Africa involved many dangers and narrow escapes. He was beaten, starved, and sold into slavery. <em>Three times</em> he received the death penalty. Through it all, he carried his Bible and warned people of the coming reign of the Messiah.</p>

<h3>2. Johann A. Bengel</h3>

<p>Before Wolff or Miller, during the first two decades of the 1700s, the second coming was taught in Germany by <strong>Bengel</strong>, a Lutheran minister. He believed in religious liberty and trained young men for the ministry. However, his greatest influence was felt through his books about the Second Advent. Wesley drew heavily from his writings, and they were spread even into Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
    "Probably no other continental theologian did so much as he to call attention to the importance of the prophetic portions of the Word... especially as it relates to the second coming of Christ."

<h3>3. Edward Irving</h3>

<p>Next to North America, the proclamation of the Second Advent had its fullest development in Great Britain. As a Scottish evangelist, <strong>Edward Irving</strong>, who received his M.A. at the age of seventeen, began studying the prophecies, particularly those with reference to the second coming.</p>

<p>His stature (<strong>6ft. 4in / 1m 95cm</strong>) and his eloquence attracted the upper classes, including the Prime Minister. The churches were so full that tickets needed to be purchased <em>six weeks in advance</em>.</p>

<p>A clergyman from Paris heard him preach and lent him a copy of Lacunza’s book, <em>The Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty</em>. Irving learned Spanish to read it, then translated it into English. He was also a key participant in the <strong>Albury Conferences</strong> organized by Henry Drummond.</p>

<h3>4. Henry Drummond</h3>

<p>Henry, an English banker and member of Parliament, devoted his life to Christian service. He arranged a series of <strong>five annual prophetic conferences</strong>. Some twenty ministers from various church and orthodox communions and countries were present, including Joseph Wolff.</p>

<p>At these conferences, the prophecies of the books of <strong>Daniel and Revelation</strong> were studied. Of these, Irving wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
    "We were so overruled by the one Spirit of truth and love, as to have found our way to harmony and coincidence in the main points of all these questions."
</blockquote>

<h3>5. Robert Winter</h3>

<p>Mr. Winter heard the doctrine of the Second Advent while attending a camp meeting during a visit to America. In 1842, he returned to England, where he entered into the work of preaching the Advent. In his frequent letters to America, he told of his progress. In one letter he said:</p>

<blockquote>
    "I preach about the streets with my chart hoisted up on a pole. Our books are flying about and are making quite a stir in this great city."
</blockquote>

<p>God blessed his humble efforts with the baptism of several thousand converts.</p>

<h3>6. Manuel de Lacunza</h3>

<p>Under the pseudonym of <strong>Juan Ben-Ezra</strong>, Lacunza, a Jesuit priest, called attention to the prophecies of <strong>Daniel and Revelation</strong>. Born in Chile, he later lived in exile in Spain and Italy. Dissatisfied with Catholic interpretations of prophecy, he went to the Bible to find out for himself.</p>

<p>His study resulted in the writing of the book <em>The Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty</em>. Despite laborious hand-copying, it was widely circulated and translated from Spanish into Latin, Italian, and English (by Irving).</p>

<h3>7. H. Heintzpeter</h3>

<p>The keeper of the Royal Museum in Holland, <strong>Heintzpeter</strong> received a vision of Christ’s soon return. He spoke of it using Bible texts to prove his point, then wrote several pamphlets from about <strong>1830-1842</strong>, explaining the light he had received.</p>

<p>He first heard of William Miller <em>twelve years</em> after he began to publish.</p>

<h3>8. Louis Gaussen</h3>

<p>The book <em>The Great Controversy</em> nicely sums up the work of Gaussen. Ellen White tells of his unique style of preaching through a method first used by the reformer <strong>William Farel</strong> — teaching the children.</p>

<p>No one could use the excuse that these things were too hard and complicated to understand if children grasped the significance and enjoyed it. The plan worked; adults began to come and listen, high society was reached, and foreigners visiting Geneva heard and were convicted, carrying the news to other countries.</p>

<p>Eventually, Gaussen published the lessons, widening their success. Despite being one of the most distinguished preachers in the French language, he was suspended for using the Bible to instruct the youth instead of the church catechism. He continued his ministry outside the recognized church.</p>

<h3>9. Francisco Ramos Mejia</h3>

<p>It is worth noting the impact the second coming concept had in lesser-known areas like Argentina. Among the leaders of this country’s struggle for independence were national heroes who were also students and believers in the Advent.</p>

<p><strong>Ramos Mejia</strong> (who died before Miller began his preaching) believed:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Christ’s return was imminent</li>
    <li>The Bible, not tradition, was the rule of faith</li>
    <li>Education was crucial (he began schools for the Indians)</li>
    <li>The Ten Commandments were the norm for Christians (he kept the Sabbath)</li>
    <li>The correct relationship between faith and works</li>
</ul>

<p>Other notable figures included <strong>Manuel Belgrano</strong>, the designer of the national flag, and <strong>Domingo Sarmiento</strong>, the first president of Argentina.</p>
