  <h2>Lesson 13 - The Great Controversy</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Bible Reveals a Cosmic Battle</h3>
  <p>The Bible teaches that there is a cosmic battle between good and evil, known as the Great Controversy. This conflict is foundational to understanding why Jesus came to this earth.</p>

  <h3>2. The Origin of the Controversy</h3>
  <p><strong>Revelation 12:7-9</strong> - "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not... and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world..."</p>

  <p><strong>Psalm 19:7</strong> - "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple."</p>
  <p>The root issue of the great controversy is the law of God. Satan aimed to discredit and overthrow God’s law and authority.</p>

Lesson 13 - The Great Controversy

The Bible reveals that there is a cosmic battle between good and evil, often referred to as the Great Controversy. This ongoing conflict helps us understand the deeper reasons why Jesus came to this earth. It shows that our world is not just a physical battlefield, but a spiritual one.
This great controversy began in heaven. According to Revelation 12:7-9, there was war in heaven between Michael and his angels and the dragon, who is called the Devil and Satan. Satan rebelled, questioning God’s law and authority. He claimed that God’s law restricted freedom and sought to do away with it entirely. This rebellion even affected some of the angels.
Psalm 19:7 tells us, “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.” Satan’s attack was directed at this perfect law. According to Patriarchs and Prophets, the controversy from the beginning was about God’s law. In attacking the law, Satan was aiming to overthrow the authority of its Author—God Himself.
We can trace the great controversy through the Old Testament. In Genesis 3, Satan tempted Eve and introduced sin into the world. Soon after, in Genesis 4, Cain killed his brother Abel, showing how sin quickly escalated. In Genesis 6 to 9, God judged a wicked world with a flood, but saved Noah’s family. The story of Job shows Satan challenging Job’s faith, and how God allowed Job to be tested. Later, in Exodus 32, Israel worshipped a golden calf, showing Satan’s influence on God’s people. In 1 Kings 18, Elijah confronted Israel’s apostasy and the false prophets of Baal. In Daniel 10, we see a glimpse of the unseen spiritual battle as a heavenly messenger was delayed by spiritual opposition.
Ellen White, in Education, wrote that “behind, above, and through all the play and counterplay of human interests and power and passions, the agencies of the all-merciful One, silently, patiently working out the counsels of His own will.” This reminds us that God is always in control, even in times of confusion.
The New Testament also reveals the great controversy. In Matthew 2, Satan worked through Herod to kill Jesus as a baby. In Matthew 4, Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness, trying to derail His mission. In Matthew 8, Jesus cast out demons, showing His authority over evil. Ephesians 6 reminds us that our fight is not against people, but against spiritual forces of evil. In Revelation 12, Satan persecuted the church, but God protected it. Verse 17 says Satan is especially angry with the faithful—those who keep God’s commandments and have the testimony of Jesus.
In Desire of Ages, Ellen White describes how Jesus’ encounter with the demon-possessed men in Gergesa revealed Satan’s goal to degrade humanity, and Christ’s mission to rescue us from that power.
The great controversy reaches its climax at the cross. In Luke 23, as Jesus hung on the cross, it may have looked like Satan had won. But in reality, Christ’s death was the turning point. According to Signs of the Times, when Jesus died, Satan knew he had lost his chance to destroy God’s plan of salvation.
Revelation 12:12 warns that Satan is full of fury because he knows his time is short. But Revelation 20:10 assures us that in the end, Satan will be destroyed in the lake of fire, and the great controversy will be over.
In conclusion, this cosmic battle is not just a distant story. It is personal. It affects each of us. Understanding the great controversy helps us stay faithful, obey God’s law, and trust in the victory Jesus has already won for us.

  <h2>Lesson 14 - The Plan of Redemption</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Entrance of Sin and the Need for Redemption</h3>
  <p>
    Sin entered the world through Adam, and with it, death and separation from God affected all humanity.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Romans 5:12 (RSV):</strong> "Therefore as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned."</p>
    <p><strong>Romans 3:23:</strong> "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."</p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 4:18:</strong> "They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart."</p>
    <p><strong>Romans 5:20:</strong> "But where sin increased, grace abounded all the more."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>2. The Helpless State of Humanity</h3>
  <p>
    Mankind is unable to save himself from guilt, unrighteousness, and the power of sin. He needs:
    <ul>
      <li>Pardon</li>
      <li>Regeneration</li>
      <li>Power to overcome evil</li>
    </ul>
    These are all provided through Jesus Christ.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Role of Christ in Redemption</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus Christ, as the "second Adam," came in human form to conquer sin and Satan.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>1 John 3:8 (Goodspeed):</strong> "This is why the Son of God appeared - to undo the devil’s work."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    By His sinless life and atoning death, Christ:
    <ol>
      <li>Demonstrated the justice of God’s law</li>
      <li>Refuted Satan’s accusations</li>
      <li>Made salvation possible for all who believe</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>4. Stages of the Plan of Redemption</h3>

  <h4>a. Justification</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Romans 3:23-24:</strong> "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus."</p>
    <p><strong>Romans 5:18:</strong> "Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men."</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians 2:16:</strong> "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ."</p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 2:8:</strong> "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God."</p>
    <p><strong>Romans 5:1-2:</strong> "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
    <p><strong>Philippians 3:9:</strong> "And be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ."</p>
    <p><strong>1 John 5:12:</strong> "He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>Steps to Christ, p. 62.2:</strong> “If you give yourself to Him, and accept Him as your Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you are accounted righteous... You are accepted before God just as if you had not sinned.”
  </p>

  <h4>b. Sanctification</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:23:</strong> "May the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
    <p><strong>John 17:17:</strong> "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth."</p>
    <p><strong>Colossians 2:6-7:</strong> "Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built up in him."</p>
    <p><strong>John 14:15:</strong> "If you love me, you will keep my commandments."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>Message to Young People, p. 35:</strong> “The righteousness by which we are justified is imputed; the righteousness by which we are sanctified is imparted. The first is our title to heaven; the second is our fitness for heaven.”
  </p>

  <h4>c. Glorification</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:51-54:</strong> "Lo! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed... the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    At Christ’s return, the saved will be physically transformed and receive immortality.
  </p>

  <h3>5. The Fullness of Salvation in Christ</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Forgiveness</strong> - <strong>Colossians 1:14:</strong> "In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."</li>
    <li><strong>Righteousness</strong> - <strong>Romans 3:21-26:</strong> "The righteousness of God has been manifested... through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe."</li>
    <li><strong>Power</strong> - <strong>Romans 1:16:</strong> "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes."</li>
    <li><strong>Eternal Life</strong> - <strong>John 3:16:</strong> "For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life."</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Salvation through Christ Alone</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Acts 4:12:</strong> "And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This plan of redemption, carefully crafted by God before the foundation of the world, ensures that all who believe in Christ can be saved and restored into the image of God.</p>

            
            <!--
Lesson 14 – The Plan of Redemption

Let’s begin by looking at how sin entered the world and why redemption became necessary. Sin came into the world through one man—Adam—and with it came death, which spread to all people because all have sinned. The Bible in Romans 5:12 tells us, “Therefore as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned.” Similarly, Romans 3:23 says, “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Because of sin, humanity became alienated from God, as Ephesians 4:18 explains. But the good news is in Romans 5:20, which says, “Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.”
Humanity, in its fallen state, is helpless to save itself. We cannot remove guilt, achieve righteousness, or free ourselves from the power of sin. We need pardon, regeneration, and the power to overcome evil. Thankfully, all of this is made possible through Jesus Christ.
Christ came into the world as the "second Adam" to defeat sin and Satan. 1 John 3:8 tells us, “This is why the Son of God appeared—to undo the devil’s work.” Through His sinless life and His atoning death, Jesus showed the justice of God's law, answered the accusations of Satan, and made salvation possible for everyone who believes.
The plan of redemption unfolds in several stages. First, Justification. This means being declared righteous by God. Romans 3:23-24 says, “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.” Galatians 2:16 reminds us that we are not justified by works, but through faith in Jesus Christ. As Steps to Christ puts it, “If you give yourself to Him and accept Him as your Savior, you are accepted before God just as if you had not sinned.”
Next comes Sanctification, which is the ongoing process of becoming more like Christ. It’s described in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, “May the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly.” John 17:17 also says, “Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.” According to Messages to Young People, “The righteousness by which we are justified is imputed; the righteousness by which we are sanctified is imparted. The first is our title to heaven; the second is our fitness for heaven.”
Finally, there is Glorification, which is the final transformation of the saved. 1 Corinthians 15:51-54 speaks of this glorious change: “We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed... the mortal puts on immortality.” When Jesus returns, the faithful will be physically transformed and receive eternal life.
Through Christ, we receive the full gift of salvation. This includes Forgiveness, as stated in Colossians 1:14: “In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.” We are given Righteousness, as Romans 3:21-26 explains, through faith in Jesus. We are empowered to live holy lives—Romans 1:16 says, “The gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.” And most importantly, we are given Eternal Life, as found in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.”
Salvation comes through Christ alone. Acts 4:12 says, “There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”
This wonderful plan of redemption was designed by God even before the foundation of the world. It guarantees that anyone who believes in Christ can be saved and restored into the image of God.

            <!--
Lesson 15 – The Life of Christ

Christ is central to the entire Bible. In John 5:39, Jesus says, “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.” This reminds us that all of Scripture ultimately points to Christ. To know Jesus is to know the way to eternal life. As John 17:3 tells us, “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”
The Old Testament contains many prophecies about Jesus, written long before His birth. In Genesis 3:15, we read the first promise of a Savior who would crush the serpent’s head. Isaiah 9:6 foretells the birth of a child called “Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God.” Micah 5:2 speaks of Bethlehem as the birthplace of a ruler in Israel. Isaiah 53 describes a suffering servant who would bear the sins of many. Psalm 22 vividly portrays His crucifixion: “They pierced my hands and my feet… they part my garments among them.” And Psalm 16:10 assures us that God’s Holy One would not see corruption.
Jesus’ birth and childhood fulfilled these prophecies. Matthew 1:1 introduces Him as the son of David and the son of Abraham. Luke 1 tells of the angel’s message to Mary and the miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit. John 1:14 declares, “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” Luke 2 says the child grew strong in spirit, and that Jesus increased in wisdom and stature.
Jesus lived as a real human being. First Timothy 3:16 affirms, “God was manifest in the flesh.” He experienced fatigue, hunger, and thirst, just as we do. In John 4:6, Jesus is wearied from His journey. In Matthew 4:2, He hungers after fasting, and in John 19:28, He says, “I thirst.” Luke 19:10 tells us His mission: “The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” As one author wrote, “Christ did not make believe take human nature; He did verily take it.”
At the same time, Jesus was fully divine. John 1 says, “In the beginning was the Word… and the Word was God… and the Word was made flesh.” Jesus Himself declared in John 8:58, “Before Abraham was, I am,” referencing Exodus 3:14. In John 10:30, He said, “I and my Father are one.” He demonstrated divine power by knowing people’s thoughts and commanding nature itself. Matthew 12:25 says He knew their thoughts, and in Matthew 8:26-27, even the winds and the sea obeyed Him. As another author wrote, “He veiled His divinity with the garb of humanity, but He did not part with His divinity.”
Jesus lived a sinless life. First Peter 2:22 says, “Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.” First John 3:5 confirms, “In him is no sin.” Hebrews 4:15 tells us He was tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin. In John 8:46, Jesus challenges, “Which of you convinceth me of sin?” And in John 1:29, He is called “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” One commentary notes that though Jesus could have sinned, He did not even for a moment have an evil tendency. Another reminds us that He used no power in His life that isn’t available to us as well.
During His ministry, Jesus revealed the Father’s character. In John 14:9, He says, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.” Romans 8:3 speaks of God sending His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to condemn sin. In John 13:15, Jesus says, “I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.”
Jesus’ death was the ultimate act of love and sacrifice. In Matthew 27, we read of His crucifixion at Golgotha. Philippians 2:8 says He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. First Peter 3:18 reminds us that He suffered for sins, the just for the unjust. He died in our place, offering us eternal life through His sacrifice.
But death was not the end. Jesus rose from the grave! Matthew 28 proclaims, “He is not here: for he is risen.” In John 10:17-18, Jesus says He has power to lay down His life and to take it again. John 2:19 records Him saying, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” First Corinthians 15 reminds us that our faith depends on the resurrection: “If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain.” And Romans 10 says that believing in the risen Christ brings salvation. As one author wrote, “The Savior came forth from the grave by the life that was in Himself.”
After His resurrection, Jesus ascended to heaven. Acts 1:9-11 describes how He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight. The angels assured the disciples, “This same Jesus… shall so come in like manner.” In John 14:1-3, Jesus promises, “I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”

Lesson 16: How to Experience Salvation

Salvation through Jesus is offered to every person. As John 1:29 says, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” This gift is not for a select few but for all who are willing to receive it. John 3:16 emphasizes this truth: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” God’s love reaches out to every corner of the world.
Salvation, however, is not automatic—it is given to those who accept Christ. Mark 16:15-16 says, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.” Acts 4:12 adds that “there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” In Acts 16:30-31, when asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” Paul and Silas answered, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”
Salvation is something we are to actively seek. Matthew 6:33 encourages us, saying, “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” This shows us that our desire and pursuit for a relationship with God are important steps in experiencing salvation.
Believing in Christ is more than just acknowledging His existence. John 1:12 says, “But to all who did receive Him, who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God.” True faith is more than intellectual agreement—it is a deep personal trust in Christ. As one quote says, “The faith that is unto salvation is not a mere intellectual assent to the truth... it embraces Him as a personal Saviour.” Saving faith brings us into a covenant relationship with God.
There are clear steps in experiencing salvation. First is Repentance. Acts 2:38 says, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.” Acts 5:31 adds that Jesus was exalted “to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.”
Next is Confession. Proverbs 28:13 tells us, “Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.” True confession is specific, acknowledging the particular sins we are guilty of, not just general wrongdoing.
Following confession is the Acceptance of Christ. Romans 10:9-13 explains that “if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved… Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
Then comes Consecration. Romans 12:1 urges us to “present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.” Galatians 2:20 reflects the result of this consecration: “It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.” We give our whole heart to God, trusting that He asks us to surrender only what is for our own good.
When a person accepts Jesus with a penitent heart, God does several things. First, He offers Forgiveness of Sins. First John 1:9 promises, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
Next, Christ’s Righteousness is Imputed to the believer. Second Corinthians 5:21 says, “For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.” Through faith, we receive Christ’s merits, and God pardons and justifies the repentant soul.
We are also Accepted as God’s Children. First John 3:1-2 celebrates this: “See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God… Beloved, we are God’s children now.”
True salvation bears fruit, and Obedience is one of them. Jesus said in John 14:15, “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” And in John 15:10, “If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love.”
Another fruit is Constant Fellowship with Christ. When we fully give ourselves to Him, Christ’s character replaces ours, and He dwells in our hearts by faith. Galatians 2:20 expresses this experience vividly: “The life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.”
Finally, salvation brings Assurance. First John 1:7 reminds us that “the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.” And First John 5:11-13 assures believers, saying, “God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son… I write these things to you who believe… that you may know that you have eternal life.”

  <h2>Lesson 17 - The Kingdom of God</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Extent of God’s Rule</h3>
  <p>
    The term “Kingdom of God” refers to the realm over which God reigns. It encompasses the whole universe.
    <br>
    <strong>Mark 1:15:</strong> “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 4:17:</strong> “From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.’”
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 24:1:</strong> “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.”
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the actual dominion of God within this realm is partially limited because He allows His creatures the freedom of choice. This freedom resulted in the entrance of sin, which hinders the full exercise of His authority.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Present Kingdom of God in This World</h3>
  <p>
    The present kingdom of God is a spiritual or moral kingdom—existing in the hearts and lives of those who voluntarily accept God’s authority.
    <br>
    <strong>Luke 17:21:</strong> “Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.”
    <br>
    <em>(DA 506):</em> "The kingdom of God begins in the heart."
    <br>
    <strong>Hebrews 4:16:</strong> “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”
  </p>
  <p>
    This “throne of grace” is where God’s rule is accepted by faith and obedience, demonstrating His spiritual reign in the believer's inner life.
  </p>

  <h3>3. How to Enter the Kingdom of God</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus began His ministry by calling people to repentance because the kingdom was near.
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 4:17:</strong> “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Many in Jesus’ time expected a political, earthly kingdom like that of David. But Jesus made it clear that His kingdom was spiritual.
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 6:33:</strong> “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Entrance into God’s kingdom is not by birthright or nationality, but through spiritual rebirth.
    <br>
    <strong>John 3:3:</strong> “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
    <br>
    <strong>John 3:5:</strong> “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Entry requires total commitment:
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 13:44:</strong> “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field... he sells all that he has and buys that field.”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 13:45-46:</strong> “The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant... who found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.”
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Future Aspect of the Kingdom of God</h3>
  <p>
    Although God’s kingdom begins now in our hearts, it has a glorious future. When sin and sinners are eliminated, God’s kingdom will be fully established.
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 6:10:</strong> “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Entry into this final kingdom happens when Christ returns:
    <br>
    <strong>1 Thessalonians 4:16-17:</strong> “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven... and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them... and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
  </p>
  <p>
    At that time, all earthly kingdoms will be destroyed.
    <br>
    <strong>Daniel 2:44:</strong> “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom... it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ will reign with the Father in this everlasting kingdom:
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 15:28:</strong> “And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him... that God may be all in all.”
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    God’s kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope. It begins in the heart through repentance, faith, and obedience, and culminates in a glorious eternal reign where Christ and God the Father rule with redeemed humanity.
  </p>

Lesson 17 - The Kingdom of God

The term "Kingdom of God" refers to the realm over which God reigns. This kingdom is not limited to a small group or region—it encompasses the entire universe. In Mark 1:15, Jesus proclaimed, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.” Similarly, in Matthew 4:17, we read, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” The psalmist in Psalm 24:1 reminds us, “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” Despite God’s universal rule, His dominion is not always fully exercised in every heart because He grants His creatures the freedom of choice. Unfortunately, that freedom has allowed sin to enter, which hinders the full expression of His authority.
The present kingdom of God in this world is a spiritual and moral reality. It exists within the hearts and lives of those who voluntarily submit to God's rule. In Luke 17:21, Jesus tells us, “The kingdom of God is within you.” Ellen White, in DA page 506, affirms this by saying, “The kingdom of God begins in the heart.” Hebrews 4:16 encourages believers to approach God's throne of grace with confidence, where mercy and help are found. This throne of grace symbolizes God’s rule accepted through faith and obedience, demonstrating His spiritual reign in the lives of believers.
Jesus began His ministry by calling people to repentance because the kingdom of heaven was near. Many people in His time expected a political kingdom like that of King David, but Jesus emphasized that His kingdom was spiritual. He said in Matthew 6:33, “Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.” Entry into God's kingdom is not determined by physical birth or nationality, but by spiritual rebirth. In John 3:3, Jesus declared, “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” He further explained in John 3:5 that this rebirth must be of “water and of the Spirit.”
Entering God’s kingdom requires total commitment. In Matthew 13:44, the kingdom is compared to treasure hidden in a field. When a man finds it, he sells everything he has to obtain it. Likewise, in Matthew 13:45-46, Jesus compares the kingdom to a pearl of great price, for which a merchant sells all he owns to make it his. These parables emphasize the value and commitment involved in embracing the kingdom of God.
While the kingdom begins in our hearts now, there is also a future aspect to it. When sin and sinners are finally removed, God's kingdom will be fully and visibly established. Jesus taught us to pray in Matthew 6:10, “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Entry into this final kingdom will occur when Christ returns, as described in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, where the dead in Christ will rise, and the living faithful will be caught up to meet the Lord.
At that time, all earthly kingdoms will be destroyed, making way for the everlasting kingdom of God. In Daniel 2:44, it is written, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed... and it shall stand forever.” Ultimately, Christ will reign with the Father in this eternal kingdom. 1 Corinthians 15:28 explains that when all things are made subject to Christ, He will also submit to the Father, so that “God may be all in all.”
In conclusion, God's kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope. It starts now with repentance, faith, and obedience, and will be fully realized in a glorious eternal reign where Christ and God the Father rule with their redeemed people.
