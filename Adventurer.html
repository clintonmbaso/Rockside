                        <span style="color:#2F5496;">Introduction<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">The requirements and teaching helps are taken from the North American Division (NAD) program of the same name. That program is intended for children four years old, with the Little Fish program for children five years old. Children should not start this class before they have passed their fourth birthday.<br>
The NAD manual can be used if you wish to order them from Advent Source (see below). However the cost is fairly high especially when freight is added. The manuals are very colourful with lots of helpful information but they are NOT NECESSARY to run the course. Also it must be remembered that the requirements in this manual are NOT the same as those in the NAD manual. Almost all the material here is taken from that manual, but in most cases it is shortened and there are general articles of helps for leaders and teachers that are omitted here.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">CAUTION<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Some of these activities would not be considered suitable for Sabbath hours in most of our churches in Sydney. However, they have been listed as they are in the NAD manual. It may be that some of the Stars would be best done on a Sunday.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
ADVENT SOURCE<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Go to www.adventsource.org on the Internet and purchase using your credit card. Little Lamb supplies are found by selecting Ministry@ from the menu at the top of the page, then Adventurer Club@ from the menu on the right, then Little Lamb@ from the list that comes up under Adventurer Club.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">FEEDBACK<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">This is no longer a trial program. But comments would still be appreciated. Send them to the Youth Department at the Conference to tamasianoerianto@adventist.org.au or to Norman Tew (normtew@tech2u.com.au). If you have any activities, crafts or stories that would help in any of the requirements of this course please send these also. We have no plans to change this manual but extra teaching helps can always be added to those already on the web site. Thank you.<br>

                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">BECAUSE JESUS LOVES ME, I CAN ALWAYS DO MY BEST.<br>
Though the NAD uses a different wording for the Little Lamb Pledge, we will be using the Adventurer pledge for pre-Adventurers also.<br>
Note that the pledge as used in the South Pacific Division includes the word “can” not “will” as is used in some other areas of the world.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                        </span><span style="color:#1F3763;"><strong>Uniform</strong><br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Use the regular Adventurer Uniform.<br>
The Little Lamb stars can be sewn on the bottom section of the front of the sash. The Little Fish diamonds can go on the next section of the sash and the Adventurer awards on the top of the sash.<br>
                           <br>
Sashes are being sold by the Mountain View club (currently the price is A$8.00), but these can also be purchased at Girl Guide stores as their colour matches ours. It is recommended that a piece of velcro be sewn under the sash where it crosses the right shoulder, with the matching piece of velcro on the shoulder of the uniform shirt. This will stop the sash from slipping off, as it will do so for small children!<br>
                           <br>
If it is desired to use the Little Lamb Puzzle patch this could be sewn onto the scarf where the Adventurer logo is normally placed. However, this is optional, we are not recommending this. <br>
                           <br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">The normal meeting length would be 60 to 75 minutes.<br>
As noted in the requirement section, each week you will fulfill the requirements of one star OR one of the four sections of the requirements.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>GATHER THE FLOCK (5 MINUTES)</strong><em><br>
                           </em>Greet each child by name on arrival, as they are welcomed to the group.<br>
The children stand in a circle and recite the Little Lamb Pledge and sing the song Jesus is My<br>
Shepherd at (see page 33).<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>LAMB TALES (5-10 MINUTES) </strong><br>
Tell the story if at all possible. If you are unable to tell the story, then read it in an interesting way and show the pictures in the book you are reading from.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Select a story that meets the requirements of the subject of the meeting.<br>

                           <strong>LAMB FROLICS (45-60 MINUTES)</strong><br>
In this section you will have four different activities that relate to the subject of the meeting. Each<br>
activity will last from 10 to 15 minutes only.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>GOOD-BAA LITTLE LAMBS (5 MINUTES)</strong><br>
Gather the pre-Adventurers into a circle. (This can be done by having the children hold hands. Move backwards slowly until the circle is formed). Discuss what new things they learned this week, or ask questions about what they enjoyed best etc.<br>
                           <br>
Close with a very short prayer. <br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">At this age most children cannot read or write; most have difficulty coloring between the lines, and all have the need to be active.<br>
Thus the use of work books is not compulsory. The use of a display book to store materials produced and/or pictures of activities is a good idea. Use active learning methods.<br>
                           <br>

Repeat from memory the Adventurer Pledge<em><br>
                           </em>Complete the requirements for each of the four sections: My God, My World, My Family and Myself (see the next four pages).<br>
                           <em><br>
                           </em>Earn SIX Little Lamb Stars of your choice (see from page 13 onwards). These are like Adventurer Awards, but much simpler.<br>
                           <em><br>
                           </em>It would be expected that the six stars and four sections (My God, My World, My Family &amp; My Self) could be done one at each meeting. Thus, in the ten meetings for a year four would be devoted to the four sections and six to six stars.<br>

                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">A story of the parable of the lost sheep, or of the childhood of Jesus (the visit to the Temple at age 12) would be especially suitable for this group.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>ACTIVITIES<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">• Sing a song about Jesus<br>
Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft, one activity, and one discussion on the topic that the children have learnt about Jesus <br>
• Prepare a sheet or blanket tent<br>
Bring oversized T-shirts and head scarves so the children can dress up as in Bible times. Encourage the children to take off their shoes and socks, and pretend to cook, or watch their sheep etc. Or just do dress up letting the children try different ideas, and let them suggest the kinds of toys Jesus might have played with (hint - his father was a carpenter so there would have been wood scraps).<br>
• Play Simon Sa</span><span style="color:#000000;">ys using the term the Shepherd ins</span><span style="color:#231F20;">tead of Simon<br>
Draw an outline of a lamb, and prepare pictures of shepherds. Let the children glue cotton wool onto the lamb picture. While they are working or in a de-brief afterward discuss how a shepherd deals with a lost lamb and how Jesus deals with us when we wander from the way he wants us to go.<br>
• With paddlepop sticks and white glue let the children build flat topped Bible land houses. <br>
Talk about the fact that Jesus was a carpenter.<br>
This is an Iranian game that can be played sitting in a circle, and could easily be the type of game that Jesus played with his friends. The children sit in a circle with a leader. The leader does an action and the children take turns round the circle copying the action (pull a face, tug on ear or nose, stroke the hair of the person next to you, etc). In the original game anyone who laughed or made a giggle or a noise was out, but let the children stay in though trying to exercise self-control.<br>

about Creation.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Senses<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Bring a variety of plants that are safe to touch and smell, especially ones with strong scents or unusual textures. Let the children touch and smell and discuss them.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Nature sounds<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Rain using rainsticks (cardboard tubes with the ends sealed, with beans or rice inside. Thunder, drum sticks on a chair. Brook (a bottle with some water, then blow into it with a straw. Varying the level of the water varies the sound). Record and play back the children making lambs bleating, lions roaring, wind blowing etc.<br>
On a large piece of paper draw round the bare feet of the children. Show them how to change these outlines into fishes.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Land and Sea<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Having a sand tray and a tub of water (preferably outside), let the children experiment as to what they can make in the sand. What will float or sink, and the volume of unusual shaped containers by measuring water from one to another.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Rock hunt<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Hide polished or unusual rocks either inside or outside. Have the children hunt for the rocks. Discuss about the rocks with the Adventurers.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Rock varieties<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Use a magnifying glass to look at the texture of different rocks. Scrape the rocks with a nail to see the different hardness of rocks. Weigh rocks of the same size but different densities on scales. If you can find some lava (pumice), drop it into water and show that some rocks float. Have cardboard boxes with different sized holes cut in the top. Let the children sort the rocks by size using the different sized holes.<br>
                           <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Rock sculptures<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Glue small rocks to containers of cardboard or plastic, or other larger rocks. Encourage the Pre-Adventurers to make sculptures.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>STORY<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">Find a story about a family. Bible stories could be of Adam &amp; Eve, with Cain &amp; Abel; Noah’s family; Joseph or David and their brothers. A story of a modern family would be just as good. Remember modern families do not all have mothers and fathers, so include grandparents, uncles, aunts, siblings etc. Remind the children that we are all part of the family of Jesus.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>ACTIVITIES<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">Here is an action rhyme that could be used for the song about families.<br>
There are all kinds of families I see, Some are two and some are three (hold up two then three fingers) Some are eight and some are four (change the number of fingers showing) And some are more and more and more! (Raise and lower all 10 fingers.)<br>
Do four activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and one activity, plus one discussion on the things the children have learnt about families. Here are three suggestions.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Play house. <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Hang sheets from a clothes line to make walls, have a dress up box, bits of furniture (TV, phone, and other props). Have the children act out different members of a family.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Family Tree. <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Draw an outline of a tree with large leaves. Each child will need to go to an adult to place names of the people in their family on their tree. Make sure the child’s name is on one of the leaves. (Nanna, Mummy, Daddy are suitable names, you do not have to use first names etc).<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Family matching. <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Find pictures of parents, grand-parents, children etc (two of each!). On index cards, make 16 to 20 cards in a pack with 8 to 10 pairs of pictures. Have an adult with two to three children, to supervise playing game and discuss about families. Spread cards out face down, turn up two cards, if they match the child keeps them. As the child takes a matching pair ask what family member would this be (mother, sister etc). The NAD manual suggests www.gettyimages.com but going to Google, and selecting images, the father, mother, boy girl etc may be quicker.<br>

Then read a story about the parts of their bodies, and sing the action song Head shoulders, knees and toes (see http://w3.gorge.net/cannon/songs22.html - about half way down the screen). Or talk about how each of us is different and we all have something we are special at, and read a story about children who were special, (either especially skilled or even handicapped) bodies.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>ACTIVITIES<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft, one activity, and one discussion on the things the children have learned about their bodies.<br>
• You will need big sheets of white paper, plus oddments of crayons, buttons, scraps and paste. First have each child lie on the big sheet and draw round them (they do not have to lie out flat). Then let them decorate the outline of themselves, with colours, scraps etc. (NB - Observe what, how &amp; where the decorations go)<br>
• Name game, stand in a circle, name a child and bounce the ball to them, they return it. Make sure to give each child a turn and name them.<br>
• Make a sheet of paper for each child with their name outlined in dots. Let them trace in the name and decorate the paper with colours, glitter etc.<br>
• Paper bag puppets. You will need crayons, paper bags, hair coloured pieces of wool (long and short), and some buttons. Show one you have made then let the children glue on the hair with buttons for eyes, draw in mouth, nose etc. They do not have to use their own hair colouring.<br>
• Unique Me. Weigh each child and measure their height. Have them blow into a balloon to see how big they can go on one breath. Take a finger print and let them look at it through a magnifying glass. Taste samples of fruits and vegetables and record which they liked best. Record their voices (in advance) and let the group guess the names of the voices.<br>
• I can be . . . Collect pictures of firemen, nurses, police, chefs, artists, builders, veterinarians, etc, etc. together with symbolic clothes for each. Let the children choose and dress up.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Tell a story about Bible friends. Try to pick a story where there is friendship between the individual and God, and the individual and other people (or for example in the case of Noah between him and the animals, Moses and God, Paul and God, little servant girl and God, etc).<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">ACTIVITIES<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one song, one game and one craft, all about their Bible friends.<br>
• A suggestion that would suit the story of Noah would be to have each child chose a colour of paint to place on their hand. Then each child places their colour on their own and everyone else in their group’s piece of paper, to make rainbows.<br>
• Three legged obstacle course. Beware some small children will not have enough coordination to work with another child and will need to be paired with an adult. Lay out a route around obstacles in the room and have them co-operate as friends to get around the course.<br>
• Song - The Farmer in the Dell. See http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/farmer.htm for the words and music (there is a lot of other useful material on the kids section of this site).<br>
• Everyone forms a circle with one adult in the middle, each time the song is sung the last person to go to the middle calls another person by name to join them until all the children are in the middle.<br>
• Song - If you’re happy and you know it. Adapt the words of the song at </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/happand.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"> , use the word “friendly” instead of happy, and some of the actions can</span><span style="color:#000000;"> be modified to types of greetings. Song - Jesus is a Friend of Mine (action point to self) and for the last line sing “And He is -----&gt;s friend too using the name of another child. Use the music for Mary </span><span style="color:#231F20;">had a little lamb - </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/mary.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"><br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">First have the children wave, clap and scratch. Ask them what else they can do with their hands. Find a story about hands (the one about a mother’s ugly hands that became ugly rescuing her child from fire would be a good one if you know it). Tell or read it.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">ACTIVITIES<br>

• Finger Mouse. Using a rubber stamp ink pad have the children make a finger print on their paper. Show them how to turn it into a mouse. Probably each child will need adult help, though some may prefer to do their own.<br>
• If they enjoy it. let them make a second and a third and so on.<br>
• Finger plays. See http://www.nncc.org/literacy/fingplus.html and </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://w3.gorge.net/cannon/songs22.html</span><span style="color:#231F20;"> for finger plays. Or use some you know, Try to pick ones suitable for Sabbath. Use several, and do each one a few times so they learn and enjoy it.<br>
• Finger Food. Prepare bread dough in advance, let the children knead and shape it, then either bake it or send it home to be baked. Bring small cup-cakes or muffins for the children to decorate. Beware of food allergies. Let the children eat their cupcake.<br>
• Digging and planting. Using plastic tubs and potting mix, (major supervision and good gloves. Wash hands thoroughly afterwards) let the children plant some seeds to take home to watch grow. You could have twigs for pretend trees, small potatoes or carrots for the children to both plant and harvest instantly.<br>
• In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, have each child tell something you can do with your fingers and collect at least three different ideas in the group.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Ask the children what their favourite food is. For the story you and the Pre-Adventurers could go through the alphabet and find a food for each letter, let the children try to tell you also. A few examples would also help. eg. Z for Zucchini.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">ACTIVITIES<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and one game.<br>
• Taste, Smell &amp; Touch. Set up in advance taste centres with small dishes in each. The centres could be salty (nuts or popcorn), sweet (honey, suga</span><span style="color:#000000;">r), sour (lemon), bitter (broccoli, celery). Then have extra bowls with vanilla, vinegar, orange juice, cinnamon and ginger. In another area have foods with various textures (spaghetti, jelly, dry oatmeal, peeled grapes. Explain that senses help us to find things we like or do not like. Let them visit the various centres (tab</span><span style="color:#231F20;">les) and experience the differences of each food. Have adult supervision at each table.<br>
• Fruit and Veggie stamped place mats. Before class cut fruit and vegetables in halves and make “stamps”. Apples have a star design in the middle, green peppers make a fun shamrock shape. Prepare paint containers. Protect work area with newspapers or plastic. Tell the children they are going to make place mats to remind them to eat fruit and vegetables, make sure they understand what place mats are. Use different stamps to put designs all over each place mat. After the paint has dried the mats may be laminated.<br>
• Fun with Foods. Divide the children into teams, with a starting line and a chair some distance from the line. The children are to be creative in taking the food to the chair. This is not a race, but a display of creativity, encourage teams to cheer each other. An orange can be pushed along the floor with the nose, an (hard boiled) egg can go on a spoon, a round fruit can be carried on a flat board etc, etc.<br>
• Fruit Kebabs. You will need sticks and lots of bright fruit pieces, especially those with a good scent. Let the children make up kebab sticks then eat from them. (Watch the point of the stick and direct the Pre-Adventurers). In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, let the children tell you what they have learnt about healthy food to eat.<br>

Heart check. Have the children run hard on the spot, then listen to each others heart beats. Borrow a stethoscope if possible or use tubes from paper towels etc.<br>
Lung check. Have a two litre bottle full of water, invert it into a bowl of water so the top is under water. Now with a bendy straw let the child blow as much air as possible into the bottle after taking a deep breath. This can measure their lung capacity.<br>
Body parts.<br>
Sit the children in a circle with each holding onto a long rope with both hands. Call out a body part and they must touch the rope to that body part.<br>
Keep a balloon in the air using only hands, or heads or other body parts.<br>
Jump in and out of hoops on the floor, or crawl through hoops etc.<br>
I’ve got the beat. Arrange for an adult to beat a drum. The children move around the room in time to the beat as it becomes faster, slower or stops (then they freeze) etc.<br>
People at play. Bring pictures of people in sports or at play. Have the children make one big poster or individual posters showing healthy activity. (this would be for requirement 4).<br>

• Caterpillar wiggles. Bring in a caterpillar. If unable to, bring some pictures of caterpillars. Have the children lie on one side of the room on their stomachs with their arms at their sides and their legs out straight. Ask them to wiggle their way across the room.<br>
• Bug art. Get some smooth rocks from a river bed, or store. Have the children paint them as bugs. Some stick-on eyes would be useful.<br>
• Ants on a log. (This does not fit the requirements but is fun). Check for food allergies first. Cut celery sticks, with wooden craft sticks spread peanut butter, cream cheese etc in the celery stick (the log). Place raisins on the log (the ants). Eat it all up!<br>

• Making Instruments. Options <br>
Rhythm sticks. Piece of dowel which can be decorated. <br>
Maracas, small plastic bottles with beans, rice or small stones which rattle when shaken. <br>

• Sounds around. Using a tape recorder, record sounds, wind, rain, water running, animal noises, even the children arriving, chimes, car horns, footsteps. If you have head phones allow the children to take turns in identify the sounds. Alternately play each sound separately for the group and have individuals take turns at guessing what the sound is.<br>
• Hand clapping. Have the children play hand clapping games, either by themselves or with a partner. If you know any suitable chants that go with clapping games use them. <br>

                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">ACTIVITIES<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one song activity, one craft and a game.<br>
• This is the way we . . . Have a box of props for each child, then sing to the tune of Here we go round the mulberry bush (see http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/mulberry.htm) Not all the verses there are suitable but sweep the floor, pick up toys, dust the house, wash the car and you can invent others.<br>
• Ways I can Help. Collect stickers or pictures of ways children can help with cleaning activities. Stick the pictures on a page or poster (combined work with several children) and let the children complete the work with crayons etc.<br>
• Watch Me Help. Break the children into very small groups to do some or all of the following activities. A) Washing and drying dishes with a tub of water. B) Sweeping - make a spill of beans, macaroni of popcorn to be swept up. C) Gardening, plant some sunflowers or other big seeds in some semi-prepared soil. D) Cooking using mixing bowls and wooden spoons to mix beans, dried pasta, oats and raisins. (OH&amp;S be aware of prepared pot-mix).<br>
• Sewing Fun. Using very stiff card or thin plywood, outline the edge of a picture with holes. The children can thread thick wool (or coloured string) through. You may be able to avoid a needle by waxing the end of the string or wool to make its own point. Roll sticky tape tightly around the end of the wool/string also makes it easy to thread.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Discuss how people used to use stars to guide them on their journeys. Read a story of the early Polynesians and how they used stars to cross the Pacific or tell the story of the Wise Men who found Jesus by following a special star.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">ACTIVITIES<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and an action game.<br>
• Follow the star. Have a big cardboard star that you can hold up. Have the children follow you around the hall or around an “obstacle” course, copying the way you skip, hop, walk, crawl etc.<br>
• Make a lot of stars of different materials and sizes. Have a series of boxes with a star of each size marked on each box. Have the children sort the stars by size into the boxes.<br>
• Sparkling stars. Have enough star shaped stencils (purchase or make your own) one for each child. Let them fill the area in the stencil shape with glitter glue, then sprinkle on the glitter. Repeat all over the paper provided to each child, so they have lots of glitter stars of different colours.<br>
• Night Sky. You will need Styrofoam cups, torches, and ball point pens to make holes in the base of the cups. Let each child make a couple of holes in the base of their cup. Make the room dark, then let the children make a night sky on the ceiling by using the torches inside the cups. A low ceiling would be best, some spare cups will be needed for the children who make holes that are too big.<br>
In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, discuss what they have learned about stars.<br>

• Red Light. Green Light. Have a starting line and a finishing line on the other side of the hall. Have two large circles, one red and one green, or they can be back to back like a road worker’s sign. The children line up and start to move when you hold up the green and say green light. They stop on red light. This can be repeated with different modes of travel, crawl, roll, baby steps, giant steps etc.<br>
• Construction site. Using a sand pit or sand table and toy dump trucks, scoops, bulldozers etc, allow the Adventurers to make roads, etc.<br>
• Take a Ride. This is a pretend travel time. Put chairs in bus arrangement, or make vehicles from very big boxes. Add props like tickets, maps, uniforms etc. Show pictures of various modes of travel and discuss what is good or bad about each one.<br>
• Honk, honk, beep beep. You will need transportation sounds recorded. This web site is a possible source - http://stonewashed.net/2.html. Have the children sit in a circle. Let them hear a sound, and identify it. If you can find a picture to match you can show it when they are correct. Variation <br>
- have an activity that the Adventurer’s do for each sound, eg. honk - stand up and jump, beep<br>
- hop on one leg, etc.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one activity, one craft, and an action game.<br>
• Clouds and Rain. Collect enough plastic bottles one for each child.<br>
Put some ice cubes in a bowl with very little water, place a heater (or even a bright light near the bowl so the ice will melt. Observe what happens.<br>
Place a cotton ball in water, squeeze most of the water out and put it in a sealable plastic bag, place it near a warm lamp (not close enough for the bag to melt) and look for drops of water with a magnifying glass.<br>
Make a rain gauge by cutting off the top of the bottle to a point where it has straight sides, then glue a cheap ruler inside to measure the water collected. Let the children take the rain gauges home and place them in their gardens where there’s an open space. Read the raingauge after some rain.<br>
• Hot and cold. Make 20 red circles (20 cm diameter) and 20 blue circles and 5 yellow ones. Have a picture of a hot day and one of a cold day. Place the circles in rows of five with the yellows in the middle and the reds to one side and blues to the other, Place the picture of the hot day on the red side and the cold day on the blue side. In a tray or envelope have weather pictures (sun, clouds, rain etc). Let five children start, one standing on each of the yellow circles. In turn they take a picture at random, or from the top of a stack. If it is a weather picture that makes people warmer they move one row in the red direction, if colder they move one row to the blue side. As each child reaches either the hot or cold picture another child can go to the yellow row and start.<br>
• Wind Art. Mix three paint colours to a milky consistency. Each child needs a piece of paper and a straw. An adult puts a drop of paint on the paper for the child, and the child blows through the straw to spread the paint. Extra drops of colour are added as the child works.<br>
• Sand &amp; Water. On a hot day put out a sand tray and a paddling pool. Let the children enjoy themselves.<br>
In the Good-baa Little Lambs time ask the Pre-Adventurer. “what are 3 things you learnt about weather?”<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and a game.<br>
• Have two sizes of paper plates, some pompoms (or cotton wool balls), craft glue, and black wool. You are going to make parent and baby sheep, by dipping the balls in the glue and covering the sheep with wool. Try to let everyone make at least one large and one small sheep.<br>
• Lamb puppets. The simplest puppet would be to stick the outline on the left on a craft stick, though fancier ones can be made, or the plate lambs might be used. Let the puppets act out a play. The NAD manual suggest the story Mary had a Little Lamb, but the story of the lost sheep, or a story about David and his lambs would be more appropriate. Adults will need to guide with this.<br>
• Sheep to Shirts. Enlarge the picture onto the next page and give one copy to each child. Discuss how sheep are sheared and how the fleece is made into wool. Use pictures, DVD or such on shearing and wool spinning.<br>
• Have many short pieces of wool in many colours. Let the children glue the wool onto the shirt pattern to make a woolly shirt.<br>
• Baby Animal charades. Have some toy animals in a bag. Let each child takes a turn to secretly take a toy from the bag, then come back and act as that baby animal until the others guess what they are. Alternatively if a child is too shy let the whole group act out the animal.<br>

ACTIVITIES<br>
Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one activity, one craft, and a game.<br>
• Flamingo Prints. The instructions are to cut out this outline in the middle of a paper plate and use it as a stencil (use small sponges to transfer the paint). Several flamingos can go on each piece of paper. Tell the children about flamingos and how they eat and where they live.<br>
• Animal Actions. Collect pictures of as many animals as you can. Show them to the children one at a time and have the children imitate them.<br>
• Snake: slither on floor<br>
• Humming bird ; flap arms very fast<br>
• Penguins : arms at side, waddle<br>
• Eagle : spread arms and soar<br>
• Kangaroo: hop<br>
• Elephant: walk swaying with their trunk going from side to side<br>
• Zoo environments. Build different environments such as: a tub of water with plastic fish, starfish, shells etc for an ocean environment; a sandy tray with toy camels, snakes, meerkats, rabbits for a desert; tunnels of big boxes that the children can crawl through for wombats, foxes, ants etc.<br>
• Big Cats. Buy or make lion masks (to make a mask take a paper plate, colour it yellow, draw on a cat face with cut out eyes, glue yarn round the edges for a mane. Fix a string via holes on each side to hold it to the face). Find pictures of the dens of big cats, and make with boxes, trees and imagination. Let the children pretend they are big cats at home.<br>
In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, discuss requirement 2 (you should have done part of this in the story time).<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Since at this age it is difficult for a child to “make up” material missed during an absence we will require that while the class as a whole must meet the minimum requirements for investiture, an individual child will be invested if they have an 80% attendance record. While it would be nice if each child were able to “make up” any items they missed this will minimise problems.<br>
The class group of which the child is a member, must cover the material; each child must have an 80% attendance record. Items to be covered at home should be vouched for separately. There are now two ways of recording for the Little Lambs class.<br>
Little Lambs Class Record Card is now available for the Pre-Adventurer class. This is signed of by the class teacher as soon as the Little Lambs have completed the requirements. The card is designed so that a record can be kept of the Diamonds that the Little Lambs completes.<br>
The Work and Attendance Record Sheets. Write the names of the Little Lambs and the dates for the meetings.The work record could then be kept for each group to make sure that each group covers the necessary requirements.<br>
On the next page is a form that can be copied and used for an attendance record sheet, and on the following page is a form that can be used to record what work was done at each meeting. The forms on the next two pages should be printed in landscape format.<br>

• A suggestion that would suit the story of Noah would be to have each child chose a colour of paint to place on their hand. Then each child places their colour on their own and everyone else in their group’s piece of paper, to make rainbows.<br>
• Three legged obstacle course. Beware some small children will not have enough coordination to work with another child and will need to be paired with an adult. Lay out a route around obstacles in the room and have them co-operate as friends to get around the course.<br>
• Song - The Farmer in the Dell. See http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/farmer.htm for the words and music (there is a lot of other useful material on the kids section of this site).<br>
• Everyone forms a circle with one adult in the middle, each time the song is sung the last person to go to the middle calls another person by name to join them until all the children are in the middle.<br>
• Song - If you’re happy and you know it. Adapt the words of the song at </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/happand.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"> , use the word “friendly” instead of happy, and some of the actions can</span><span style="color:#000000;"> be modified to types of greetings.

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Ask the children what their favourite food is. For the story you and the Pre-Adventurers could go through the alphabet and find a food for each letter, let the children try to tell you also. A few examples would also help. eg. Z for Zucchini.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">ACTIVITIES<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and one game.<br>
• Taste, Smell &amp; Touch. Set up in advance taste centres with small dishes in each. The centres could be salty (nuts or popcorn), sweet (honey, suga</span><span style="color:#000000;">r), sour (lemon), bitter (broccoli, celery). Then have extra bowls with vanilla, vinegar, orange juice, cinnamon and ginger. In another area have foods with various textures (spaghetti, jelly, dry oatmeal, peeled grapes. Explain that senses help us to find things we like or do not like. Let them visit the various centres (tab</span><span style="color:#231F20;">les) and experience the differences of each food. Have adult supervision at each table.<br>
• Fruit and Veggie stamped place mats. Before class cut fruit and vegetables in halves and make “stamps”. Apples have a star design in the middle, green peppers make a fun shamrock shape. Prepare paint containers. Protect work area with newspapers or plastic. Tell the children they are going to make place mats to remind them to eat fruit and vegetables, make sure they understand what place mats are. Use different stamps to put designs all over each place mat. After the paint has dried the mats may be laminated.<br>
• Fun with Foods. Divide the children into teams, with a starting line and a chair some distance from the line. The children are to be creative in taking the food to the chair. This is not a race, but a display of creativity, encourage teams to cheer each other. An orange can be pushed along the floor with the nose, an (hard boiled) egg can go on a spoon, a round fruit can be carried on a flat board etc, etc.<br>
• Fruit Kebabs. You will need sticks and lots of bright fruit pieces, especially those with a good scent. Let the children make up kebab sticks then eat from them. (Watch the point of the stick and direct the Pre-Adventurers). In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, let the children tell you what they have learnt about healthy food to eat.<br>

Heart check. Have the children run hard on the spot, then listen to each others heart beats. Borrow a stethoscope if possible or use tubes from paper towels etc.<br>
Lung check. Have a two litre bottle full of water, invert it into a bowl of water so the top is under water. Now with a bendy straw let the child blow as much air as possible into the bottle after taking a deep breath. This can measure their lung capacity.<br>
Body parts.<br>
Sit the children in a circle with each holding onto a long rope with both hands. Call out a body part and they must touch the rope to that body part.<br>
Keep a balloon in the air using only hands, or heads or other body parts.<br>
Jump in and out of hoops on the floor, or crawl through hoops etc.<br>
I’ve got the beat. Arrange for an adult to beat a drum. The children move around the room in time to the beat as it becomes faster, slower or stops (then they freeze) etc.<br>
People at play. Bring pictures of people in sports or at play. Have the children make one big poster or individual posters showing healthy activity. (this would be for requirement 4).<br>
In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, get each child to say three things they have learned about being healthy (requirement 2).<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and an insect game.<br>
• Bugs in a bottle. Put some soil, some leaves, and some water or sugar water in a bottle and capture a few insects for the children to study. With a magnifying glass. Discuss their food and life style.&nbsp; At the end go outside and release the insects.<br>
• Caterpillar wiggles. Bring in a caterpillar. If unable to, bring some pictures of caterpillars. Have the children lie on one side of the room on their stomachs with their arms at their sides and their legs out straight. Ask them to wiggle their way across the room.<br>
• Bug art. Get some smooth rocks from a river bed, or store. Have the children paint them as bugs. Some stick-on eyes would be useful.<br>
• Ants on a log. (This does not fit the requirements but is fun). Check for food allergies first. Cut celery sticks, with wooden craft sticks spread peanut butter, cream cheese etc in the celery stick (the log). Place raisins on the log (the ants). Eat it all up!<br>
In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, ask each child to share the three things they have learnt about insects during the meeting.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one activity involving clapping, one craft and a musical action game.<br>
• Movement to rhythm. Have an adult play a drum or other percussion instrument. Start with the children hopping in time to the beat. As they get the idea speed it up, then vary the beat. Try other movements, such as throwing something light up, tossing bean bags, or clapping paper plates together etc.<br>
• Making Instruments. Options <br>
Rhythm sticks. Piece of dowel which can be decorated. <br>
Maracas, small plastic bottles with beans, rice or small stones which rattle when shaken. <br>
Stamping sticks, using mailing tubes or similar up to 1 metre long. Tape one end closed. That end is hit against the floor. Decorate the tubes.<br>
• Sounds around. Using a tape recorder, record sounds, wind, rain, water running, animal noises, even the children arriving, chimes, car horns, footsteps. If you have head phones allow the children to take turns in identify the sounds. Alternately play each sound separately for the group and have individuals take turns at guessing what the sound is.<br>
• Hand clapping. Have the children play hand clapping games, either by themselves or with a partner. If you know any suitable chants that go with clapping games use them. <br>
In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, you can ask what are some different ways the children now<br>
know to make music.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Begin by showing various things that are used to clean in the house. Ask what is cleaned with each item. Find a story about cleaning in the house, perhaps one about a child keeping (or not keeping) their own room tidy.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">ACTIVITIES<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one song activity, one craft and a game.<br>
• This is the way we . . . Have a box of props for each child, then sing to the tune of Here we go round the mulberry bush (see http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/mulberry.htm) Not all the verses there are suitable but sweep the floor, pick up toys, dust the house, wash the car and you can invent others.<br>
• Ways I can Help. Collect stickers or pictures of ways children can help with cleaning activities. Stick the pictures on a page or poster (combined work with several children) and let the children complete the work with crayons etc.<br>
• Watch Me Help. Break the children into very small groups to do some or all of the following activities. A) Washing and drying dishes with a tub of water. B) Sweeping - make a spill of beans, macaroni of popcorn to be swept up. C) Gardening, plant some sunflowers or other big seeds in some semi-prepared soil. D) Cooking using mixing bowls and wooden spoons to mix beans, dried pasta, oats and raisins. (OH&amp;S be aware of prepared pot-mix).<br>
• Sewing Fun. Using very stiff card or thin plywood, outline the edge of a picture with holes. The children can thread thick wool (or coloured string) through. You may be able to avoid a needle by waxing the end of the string or wool to make its own point. Roll sticky tape tightly around the end of the wool/string also makes it easy to thread.<br>
Remember that the fifth requirement has to be done at home for a week. In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, discuss helping at home.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and an action game.<br>
• Follow the star. Have a big cardboard star that you can hold up. Have the children follow you around the hall or around an “obstacle” course, copying the way you skip, hop, walk, crawl etc.<br>
• Make a lot of stars of different materials and sizes. Have a series of boxes with a star of each size marked on each box. Have the children sort the stars by size into the boxes.<br>
• Sparkling stars. Have enough star shaped stencils (purchase or make your own) one for each child. Let them fill the area in the stencil shape with glitter glue, then sprinkle on the glitter. Repeat all over the paper provided to each child, so they have lots of glitter stars of different colours.<br>
• Night Sky. You will need Styrofoam cups, torches, and ball point pens to make holes in the base of the cups. Let each child make a couple of holes in the base of their cup. Make the room dark, then let the children make a night sky on the ceiling by using the torches inside the cups. A low ceiling would be best, some spare cups will be needed for the children who make holes that are too big.<br>

• Red Light. Green Light. Have a starting line and a finishing line on the other side of the hall. Have two large circles, one red and one green, or they can be back to back like a road worker’s sign. The children line up and start to move when you hold up the green and say green light. They stop on red light. This can be repeated with different modes of travel, crawl, roll, baby steps, giant steps etc.<br>
• Construction site. Using a sand pit or sand table and toy dump trucks, scoops, bulldozers etc, allow the Adventurers to make roads, etc.<br>
• Take a Ride. This is a pretend travel time. Put chairs in bus arrangement, or make vehicles from very big boxes. Add props like tickets, maps, uniforms etc. Show pictures of various modes of travel and discuss what is good or bad about each one.<br>
• Honk, honk, beep beep. You will need transportation sounds recorded. This web site is a possible source - http://stonewashed.net/2.html. Have the children sit in a circle. Let them hear a sound, and identify it. If you can find a picture to match you can show it when they are correct. Variation <br>
- have an activity that the Adventurer’s do for each sound, eg. honk - stand up and jump, beep<br>
- hop on one leg, etc.<br>

• Clouds and Rain. Collect enough plastic bottles one for each child.<br>
Put some ice cubes in a bowl with very little water, place a heater (or even a bright light near the bowl so the ice will melt. Observe what happens.<br>
Place a cotton ball in water, squeeze most of the water out and put it in a sealable plastic bag, place it near a warm lamp (not close enough for the bag to melt) and look for drops of water with a magnifying glass.<br>
Make a rain gauge by cutting off the top of the bottle to a point where it has straight sides, then glue a cheap ruler inside to measure the water collected. Let the children take the rain gauges home and place them in their gardens where there’s an open space. Read the raingauge after some rain.<br>
• Hot and cold. Make 20 red circles (20 cm diameter) and 20 blue circles and 5 yellow ones. Have a picture of a hot day and one of a cold day. Place the circles in rows of five with the yellows in the middle and the reds to one side and blues to the other, Place the picture of the hot day on the red side and the cold day on the blue side. In a tray or envelope have weather pictures (sun, clouds, rain etc). Let five children start, one standing on each of the yellow circles. In turn they take a picture at random, or from the top of a stack. If it is a weather picture that makes people warmer they move one row in the red direction, if colder they move one row to the blue side. As each child reaches either the hot or cold picture another child can go to the yellow row and start.<br>
• Wind Art. Mix three paint colours to a milky consistency. Each child needs a piece of paper and a straw. An adult puts a drop of paint on the paper for the child, and the child blows through the straw to spread the paint. Extra drops of colour are added as the child works.<br>
• Sand &amp; Water. On a hot day put out a sand tray and a paddling pool. Let the children enjoy themselves.<br>

• Have two sizes of paper plates, some pompoms (or cotton wool balls), craft glue, and black wool. You are going to make parent and baby sheep, by dipping the balls in the glue and covering the sheep with wool. Try to let everyone make at least one large and one small sheep.<br>
• Lamb puppets. The simplest puppet would be to stick the outline on the left on a craft stick, though fancier ones can be made, or the plate lambs might be used. Let the puppets act out a play. The NAD manual suggest the story Mary had a Little Lamb, but the story of the lost sheep, or a story about David and his lambs would be more appropriate. Adults will need to guide with this.<br>
• Sheep to Shirts. Enlarge the picture onto the next page and give one copy to each child. Discuss how sheep are sheared and how the fleece is made into wool. Use pictures, DVD or such on shearing and wool spinning.<br>
• Have many short pieces of wool in many colours. Let the children glue the wool onto the shirt pattern to make a woolly shirt.<br>
• Baby Animal charades. Have some toy animals in a bag. Let each child takes a turn to secretly take a toy from the bag, then come back and act as that baby animal until the others guess what they are. Alternatively if a child is too shy let the whole group act out the animal.<br>

• Big Cats. Buy or make lion masks (to make a mask take a paper plate, colour it yellow, draw on a cat face with cut out eyes, glue yarn round the edges for a mane. Fix a string via holes on each side to hold it to the face). Find pictures of the dens of big cats, and make with boxes, trees and imagination. Let the children pretend they are big cats at home.<br>
In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, discuss requirement 2 (you should have done part of this in the story time).<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Since at this age it is difficult for a child to “make up” material missed during an absence we will require that while the class as a whole must meet the minimum requirements for investiture, an individual child will be invested if they have an 80% attendance record. While it would be nice if each child were able to “make up” any items they missed this will minimise problems.<br>
The class group of which the child is a member, must cover the material; each child must have an 80% attendance record. Items to be covered at home should be vouched for separately. There are now two ways of recording for the Little Lambs class.<br>
Little Lambs Class Record Card is now available for the Pre-Adventurer class. This is signed of by the class teacher as soon as the Little Lambs have completed the requirements. The card is designed so that a record can be kept of the Diamonds that the Little Lambs completes.<br>
The Work and Attendance Record Sheets. Write the names of the Little Lambs and the dates for the meetings.The work record could then be kept for each group to make sure that each group covers the necessary requirements.<br>
On the next page is a form that can be copied and used for an attendance record sheet, and on the following page is a form that can be used to record what work was done at each meeting. The forms on the next two pages should be printed in landscape format.<br>

Counting and Number Recognition<br>
                           </strong><br>
Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to count objects from 1 to 10, recognize and identify numbers from 1 to 10, and associate numerals with their written form.<br>
                           <br>
Duration: 45 minutes<br>
                           <br>
Materials: <br>
- Number cards (1-10)<br>
- Counting objects (e.g., small toys, blocks, or pictures)<br>
- Whiteboard and markers<br>
                           <br>
Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by discussing what counting is. Explain that counting is the process of determining the quantity of items.<br>
2. Introduce the concept of numbers as symbols that represent quantities. Show them a number card (e.g., &quot;1&quot;) and explain that it represents one item.<br>
3. Emphasize the importance of numbers in our daily lives, such as when we tell time or count items.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 1: Counting Objects (10 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute a set of objects (toys, blocks, etc.) to each student.<br>
2. Ask the students to count the objects in their set, starting from 1 and going up to 10.<br>
3. Encourage them to say the numbers aloud as they count the objects.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 2: Number Recognition (10 minutes):<br>
1. Show the students a number card (e.g., &quot;3&quot;).<br>
2. Ask them to identify the number and show that many fingers.<br>
3. Repeat this with several number cards, gradually increasing the complexity.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 3: Matching Numbers and Objects (10 minutes):<br>
1. Place a random number of objects (1-10) on a table.<br>
2. Show the students a number card and ask them to find the corresponding number of objects on the table.<br>
3. This activity reinforces the association between numbers and quantities.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 4: Writing Numerals (5 minutes):<br>
1. Have the students practice writing numerals on their individual whiteboards.<br>
2. Start with simpler numbers like 1 and 2 and gradually progress to more complex numbers.<br>
3. Encourage them to write the numerals neatly.<br>
                           <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the lesson by revisiting what counting is and how numbers represent quantities.<br>
2. Remind students to practice counting and recognizing numbers in their daily activities.<br>
3. Distribute number cards or worksheets for additional practice at home.<br>
                           <br>
Homework:<br>
- Provide a worksheet with pictures of objects and ask the students to count them and write the corresponding numerals.<br>
                           <br>
Assessment:<br>
- Monitor students' participation in activities and check their homework for understanding of counting and number recognition.<br>
                           <br>
Adaptations:<br>
- For students with special needs, provide additional visual aids or one-on-one support during activities.<br>
- For advanced students, introduce numbers beyond 10 and challenge them with more complex counting activities.<br>

Counting Forward and Backward using the Number Line<br>
                           </strong><br>
Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to count forward from 1 to 20 and backward from 10 to 1 using a number line. They will understand the concept of a number line as a visual representation of counting numbers.<br>
                           <br>
Duration: 45 minutes<br>
                           <br>
Materials:<br>
- Large number line chart (1 to 20)<br>
- Small number lines for each student (1 to 20)<br>
- Whiteboard and markers<br>
- Number cards (1-20)<br>
                           <br>
Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by introducing the concept of counting forward and backward using a number line.<br>
2. Explain that a number line is a visual tool with numbers placed at equal intervals. It helps us see the order of numbers.<br>
3. Show the large number line chart and point out that 1 is on the left end, and numbers increase as you move to the right.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 1: Counting Forward (15 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute small number lines to each student. These should have the numbers 1 to 20 printed on them.<br>

Subtracting Single-Digit Numbers<br>
                           </strong><br>
Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to subtract single-digit numbers from 0 to 9, practice subtraction facts, and understand that subtraction is not commutative.<br>
                           <br>
Duration: 45 minutes<br>
                           <br>
Materials:<br>
- Whiteboard and markers<br>
- Number flashcards (0-9)<br>
- Counters or small objects (e.g., buttons, chips)<br>
                           <br>
Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Start by explaining the concept of subtraction. Emphasize that subtraction is the opposite of addition, where we find the difference between two numbers.<br>
2. Discuss the importance of understanding that subtraction is not commutative, meaning the order matters.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 1: Subtraction Facts (15 minutes):<br>
1. Show number flashcards one at a time (e.g., 5) and ask the students to call out the subtraction facts for that number (e.g., 5 - 0, 5 - 1, 5 - 2, etc.).<br>
2. Discuss how these subtraction facts represent different ways to subtract from the same number.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 2: Hands-On Subtraction (15 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute a set of counters or small objects to each student.<br>
2. Demonstrate subtraction with a simple problem, e.g., 7 - 3. Start with 7 counters and &quot;take away&quot; 3, counting what's left.<br>
3. Have students practice subtracting different numbers using their counters.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 3: Commutative Property (10 minutes):<br>
1. Write a subtraction problem on the whiteboard, e.g., 6 - 2.<br>
2. Explain that subtraction is not commutative, so 6 - 2 is not the same as 2 - 6. Write 2 - 6 on the board and show that it results in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context.<br>
3. Emphasize that the order of numbers matters in subtraction.<br>
                           <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the lesson by reviewing the key points: subtracting single-digit numbers, practicing subtraction facts, and understanding the non-commutative nature of subtraction.<br>
2. Reinforce that subtraction helps us find differences or solve problems like &quot;How much is left?&quot;<br>
                           <br>
Homework:<br>
- Assign homework that includes simple subtraction problems using numbers from 0 to 9. Students can use counters or drawings to find the answers.<br>

Course participants will give study to two main areas in this segment.<br>
1. Unders tanding Creativity<br>
2. Teaching the Path finder Curriculumn Creatively...<br>
Teaching Resource<br>
.(120 Min.)<br>
1. Understanding Creativity<br>
Some of the purposes and values in the use of creative activities are<br>
as follows:<br>
1) It makes learning more enjoyable, lasting, and meaningful.<br>
2) It provides opportunity for self-expression and development of<br>
creativity.<br>
3) It instills pride in accomplishment and builds self-confidence.<br>
4) It contributes to the development of proper self-concepts.<br>
6) It fulfills a Pathfinder's need for individual expression.<br>
.(45 min.)<br>
....45 min.)<br>
5) It provides for participation in group situations and reaction to<br>
established group approval and behavior.<br>
.(75 min.)<br>
8) It prompts respect for both adults and peer leadership.<br>
10) It helps the Pathfinder respect the property of others.<br>
11) It teaches cooperation, sharing, and taking turns.<br>
7) It relieves periods of physical restlessness with meaningful activity,<br>
coordinating mind and muscle.<br>
9) It affords opportunity to practice principles of Christian living.<br>
12) It can emphasizea Bible concept or illustrate a truth.<br>
b. What are the steps in a creative process?<br>
                           <br>
1) Preparation (Orientation)<br>
13) It provides opportunities for the Pathfinder to express his or her<br>
relationship to God and a response to Bible teaching.<br>
Keeping these purposes and values in mind, teachers and leaders will<br>
have opportunity to observe the Pathfinder's developing theological<br>
concepts and behavioral responses. This will help guide the leaders in<br>
their teaching, in their relationships with the Pathfinders, and in the<br>
selection of creative activities to effect successful learning experiences.<br>
(a) What is the problem and what are the approaches?<br>
                           <br>
Ask questions: Why is it necessary? Where should it be done? When<br>
should it be done? Who should do it? What should be done? How<br>
should it be done?<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
C.<br>
Seek parallels: What is there like this from which I might get an idea?<br>
Is there something similar I could parially copy?<br>
Modify: WVhat if this were changed? How can this be altered for<br>
the better?<br>
Magnify: What about making it bigger? What strength can we add?<br>
Could this be multiplied?<br>
Subtract and divide: What if this were smaller? What could I omit?<br>
How about dividing?<br>
Substitution: What else instead? Who else? Where else?<br>
Rearrange: Change the pattern. What about sequence? Another layout?<br>
Cause and effect (transpose). Timing?<br>
Vice-versa: What about the opposite? Can we topsy-turvy&quot;?<br>
Surprises: How about doing the unexpected?<br>
Combine: What if this and that were put together?<br>
(b) Some errors Serviceable errors<br>
Blind errors<br>
Errors of incompetence<br>
2) Frustration adapted by<br>
(a) Repression--forget it<br>
(b) Regre ssion-retreat (flight from &quot;reality&quot;)<br>
(c) CompensationHet's subs titute!<br>
(a) Emotional excess (anger vs. resignation)<br>
&quot;Once profitable orientation toward creative work is lost and<br>
frustration begins to mount, there is no sure technique of<br>
recovery but change and rest, difficult as it may be to give one's<br>
self up to these things. Sleep, travel, quiet relaxation, leisurely<br>

2. Teaching the Pathfinder Curriculum Creatively<br>
The Pathfinder Curriculum will be taught to the Pathfinders when they meet<br>
together as a whole club, or as they work together as a unit or in classes.<br>
There will also be times when Pathfinders will need to study mate rial by<br>
themselves.<br>
Teachers will therefore recognize that it will be important to assess each<br>
Pathfinder, cach group of Pathfinders, each requirement, the physical<br>
surroundings where teaching takes place, and a whole range of further factors<br>
that lead to the successful transfer of knowledge.<br>
It is important to remember that the overall aim of teaching the curriculum is<br>
to allow the Pathfinders to develop an appropriate attitude toward further<br>
learning. This will take place best when teachers make efforts to bring about<br>
the right atmosphere for learning in the place of teaching. Learning takes place<br>
best when:<br>
a. It's a time for fun<br>
Pathfinders will learn to love the things they enjoy doing, and enjoyment<br>
stems from happy surroundings. If the teacher is overly stern and<br>
demanding, or constantly finding fault, learning will become a burden. If<br>
there's no place for humor and laughter; if the Pathfinders are always being<br>
told to remain quiet, to sit and listen, and there is no sense of adventure<br>
and learning, the experience will be of little value.<br>
b. It's a time for acceptance and understanding<br>
.(75 min.)<br>
Pathfinders will be more re ady to show interest in info rmation and learn<br>
values from the instructor if they feel accepted and understood.<br>
Acceptance stems from recognition of the Pathfinders' worth and value,<br>
and the knowledge that their behavior is their best attempt to deal with<br>
their current thoughts, feelings, and situation. This may not mean that<br>
their behavior is acceptable, but that they are accepted as people.<br>
Nothing can take away the value of each person to God, and all people<br>
C. I's a time for recognition and creativity<br>
will respond best when they are accepted as important and worthwhile.<br>
Likewise, it is important to understand each Pathfinder. Become familiar<br>
with why the youth does behave in a certain way, and while you may not<br>
approve of his or her lifestyle, you can at least attempt to understand. It<br>
is important to convey to all Pathfinders a genuine acceptance and<br>
understanding.<br>
d. It's a time for imagination and creativity<br>
Pathfinders will be encouraged in their learning when instructors take<br>
the time to give genuine praise and affirmation. Pathfinders need<br>
recognition for their best efforts, and instructors can do much to lead<br>
them on in their search for knowledge by sincere and honest rewards.<br>
125<br>
Instructors need to give urgent study to this aspect of teaching. So many<br>
good clas ses fail because of lack of imagination and variety. Creativity is<br>
really essential in teaching Pathfinders. In an age where much<br>
e. It's a time for effective communication<br>
in formation is transfe rred through the medium of TV, any straight talk<br>
may well appear slow, boring, and unattractive. Successful instructors<br>
will put time and energy into discovering a whole range of ways of<br>
doing some task differently. They may choose film and discussion, role<br>
play, drama, puppetry, collage, anything other than what is expected!<br>
Pathfinders enjoy surprises; they enjoy change; they enjoy variety. Call on<br>
all the re sources you have at hand. Then have another look, and find<br>
some more. Go all out to make every class the most interesting one you<br>
have attempted.<br>
f. It's a time for fairne ss and justice<br>
Learning will also take place best if the Pathfinders recognize that they are<br>
being listened to. They will learn to appreciate their worth as they discover<br>
that their instructor considers their answers worthwhile – that the<br>
instructor shows approval of their attempts at understanding the material.<br>
The Pathfinders will feel more accepted where there's no sarcasm or put-<br>
down, and where there is a sense of honesty and trust.<br>
g. It's a time for involvement<br>
Pathfinders are quick to notice partiality, unfairness, or favoritism.<br>
Instructors will need to be conscious of the need to be equal in praise and<br>
discipline.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Instructors should seek to involve the class as much as possible. View the<br>
class as the teachers: allow them to lead out in different segments get<br>
them doing something! Seek dialogue with the class to see how they are<br>
enjoying working on a particular requirement, and review with them what<br>
h. It's time for constant assessment<br>
Constantly evaluate the work you are doing and check to see if you are<br>
reaching and achieving the goals you set for yourself and the class. There<br>
are many factors that will affect the success of your class, including simple<br>
details such as the physical setting for the place of learning. Are there too<br>
many distractions? Is the seating arrangement too restrictive? Is the room<br>
too hot or too cold? Is there not enough light, or too much noise? Have<br>
they just come in from loud, fast-moving games, and haven't yet settled<br>
down? Keep an eye on all these things - they are worth checking.<br>
i. It's a time for cooperation<br>
Teaching a particular class will best happen when done in association with<br>
the overall plans of the club. A coordinated program will be needed for each<br>
Pathfinder event, and instructors, staff members, and the direc tor will work<br>
well together when all are aware of what the program times are.<br>
Special Teaching Arrangements<br>
In special cases, provision can be made for isolated Pathfinders to participate<br>
in the program apart from the Pathfinder organization. Likewise, provision<br>
can be made for the physically handicapped and the disadvan taged. Contact<br>
your local conference youth ministries personnel to work out details for<br>
exceptions.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Teaching Methods<br>
No attempt has been made here to set out every detail of teaching methods.<br>
Each class requirement will require a different approach, depending on factors<br>
such as time of day, place, number of participants, availability of resources, and<br>
similar factors. Wherever possible, instructors should plan several alternative<br>
teaching methods for each requirement, and use the one best suited to the<br>
group and the occasion. Before setting out to teach a class, teachers would do<br>
well to consider the following:<br>
1. Study the class curriculum<br>
Teachers are encouraged to be familiar with the overall direction of the<br>
Pathfinder curriculum. Study the flow chart found in the training<br>
manuals, which outline the development of the selected areas of study.<br>
Become very aware of the place your particular class has in the overall<br>
scheme of the program.<br>
Then become familiar with the particular class requirements for the class<br>
of Pathfinders that you will have under your care (Friend, Companion<br>
etc.). Become aware of what is expected of the Pathfinders; know what<br>
the requirement is asking for. Make sure you understand the stated<br>
objective for the requirement, and then familiarize yourself with the<br>
resource material.<br>
Assess the number and needs of vour class<br>
Get to know details about the members of your Pathfinder class. Who are<br>
they, what are their learning abilities, and what are their attitudes to the<br>
particular subjects? Are there any Pathfinders in your group who require<br>
extra help in learning information? Could there be problems in the<br>
particular methods you choose to teach the class?<br>
3. Work out your teaching plan<br>
Instructors will need to develop a suitable teaching plan based on<br>
the following:<br>
a. The total number of 30-minute periods required to teach the class<br>
b. The number of 30-minute periods required to teach each section of<br>
the Classwork (Bible search, camping etc.)<br>
c. The alternative teaching methods available for teaching each<br>
requirement<br>
d. The particular time and place when you will be teaching the<br>
requirement<br>
e. The availability of additional resources and background material<br>
127<br>
f. The method of evaluation to be used when the requirement is<br>
completed<br>
they have learned.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
PATHFINDER CLASSES<br>
In considering the Pathfinder program, there are many areas in which<br>
one should become involved in order to guide the development ofa<br>
well-to unded Pathfinder.<br>
Pathfinder Classwork<br>
&quot;The children are to be trained to become missionaries; they must be<br>
helped to understand distinctly what they must do to be saved' Counsels to<br>
Parents, Teachers, and Students, p. 168. And the best preparation is the<br>
&quot;harmonious development of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual<br>
powers. It prepares the student for the joy of service in this world, and for<br>
the higher joy of wider service in the world to come&quot; (Education, p. 13).<br>
&quot;Since both men and women have a part in homemaking, boys as well as<br>
girls should gain a knowledge of household duties. To make a bed and put<br>
a room in order, to wash dishes, to prepare a meal, to wash and repair his<br>
own clothing, is a training that need not make any boy less manly; it will<br>
make him happier and more useful. And if girls, in turn, could learn<br>
use the saw and the hammer, as well as the rake and the hoe, they would<br>
be better fitted to meet the emergencies of life Education, pp. 216-217).<br>
tc<br>
It was from the study of this and other similar messages that the Pathfinder<br>
Classes were developed, and all the requirements for these classes are based<br>
on this instruction. They include, therefore, Bible and nature study, the<br>
learning of useful and helpful things to do about the home, out-of-door<br>
activities, first aid, personal and home hygiene, physical fitness, and service<br>
to others.<br>
All of this helps the youth to find true happiness in witnessing and to become<br>
a member of a great army of Adventist youth whose talents and energies are<br>
committed to Christ. They will be those whose hands are ready to grasp any<br>
emergency and turn it to the glory of the great Master Guide. The Pathfinder<br>
Classes include Friend, Companion, Explorer, Ranger, Voyager, and Guide.<br>
Pathfinder Classes and School1<br>
128<br>
Onc of thc main objcctives of the Pathfindcr Club is to prcparc the youth<br>
for life with its emergencies and help the youth to become useful to both<br>
God and man. The Pathfinder class program has been established with this<br>
in mind. It therefore seems important to guide the Pathfinder into this<br>
program of self-improvement.<br>
Since the club director has the responsibility to oversee the completion of all<br>
Pathfinder class requirements where the church operates a school, the<br>
director should go the school and make arrangements to work with the<br>
teachers in the Glasswork, then continue to keep in touch with the teachers<br>
to confirm the Pathfinders' progress. All Investiture services are to be<br>
arranged by the Pathfinder Club director with the area<br>
Pathfinder Advanced Classes<br>
Where there is a church and a school dealing with many of the same<br>
Pathfinder age children/youth, the Path finder Club and the schoolteacher<br>
should work closely together in helping the Pathfinders finish their class<br>
requirements. The school might sponsor memory work and reading the<br>
required books; the club could help with the skill requirements. The school<br>
can easily help the Pathfinder get a needed Honor in connection with regular<br>
Classwork. Then the club can help in getting other Honors that are hard for<br>
the school to complete. Among the most difficult requirements to complete<br>
are the swimming skills, important skills that all should enjoy. The ability to<br>
handle oneself in water in an emergency could be the means of saving a life.<br>
The club may take the initiative and arrange for swimming lessons during the<br>
year so that this requirement can be completed.<br>
The Advanced Class levels are based on outdoor skills. These levels are best<br>
suited to the Pathfinder Club. To be able to enjoy the out-o f-doors and to be<br>
129<br>
able to meet emergencies are good reasons why these skills should be taught<br>
by every club.<br>
coordinator/conference youth director.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
AY Honors<br>
&quot;As a rule, the exercise most beneficial to the youth will be found in useful<br>
employment. The little child finds both diversion and development play;<br>
and his sports should be such as to promote not only physical, but mental<br>
and spiri tual growth. As he gains strength and intelligence, the best<br>
recreation will be found in some line of effort that is useful. That which<br>
trains the hand to helpfulness, and teaches the young to bear their share of<br>
life's burdens, is most effective in promoting the growth of mind and<br>
character. ... it is essential for every youth to have a thorough acquaintance<br>
During the Pathfinder years youth love to work on AY Honors and to display<br>
them after they have been earned.<br>
Tips for Maintaining Enthusiasm for Pathfinder Honors<br>
1. Have a definite date for completion. When the class is started, plan to<br>
finish the work within that time period. This gives the student that<br>
enthusiasm needed to know that the class is moving along and going some<br>
place. Ifit goes over into the next period, interest will wane and it will be<br>
harder to complete.<br>
2. Make the classwork worthwhile. If interest is to be kept at a high level the<br>
classwork must not only be fun but also informative and helpful. If<br>
requirements are glossed over lightly the student gets the idea that the<br>
Honor doesn't mean much. Before receiving the Honor a test should be<br>
given so that it can be seen that the person knows the answer to all<br>
questions. The Pathfinder must do all the requirements. A class notebook<br>
is helpful in keeping up interest, and it also gives the student something<br>
to take home that can be a source of reference in the work accomplished.<br>
It also helps parents feel that the child is really getting something<br>
worthwhile.<br>
3. Waiving requirements. In some of the class requirements there may be<br>
something that cannot be done your area. No club may decide that a<br>
certain re quirement cannot be met and therefore unilate rally waive the<br>
requirement. The conference/mission youth director must be notified<br>
and approve of any change in the published requirements. When this<br>
approval has been given in writing, the club is then free to change or<br>
waive the requirement as instructed.<br>
4. Meeting Path finder Honor requirements. The following guidelines will<br>
serve in checking Pathfinder Honor requirements.<br>
a. The work must actually be performed. Each question must be<br>
answered correctly and each requirement must have been met. Honors<br>
should not be given on the idea that the person could easily do the<br>
requirement.<br>
b. All Honors must be signed for by the instructor, conference youth<br>
director, Master Guide, Pathfinder Club director, or church-school<br>
teacher on the special form provided by the conference.<br>
5. Encourage each Pathfinder to aim at Master Awards. Pathfinder<br>
Honors are categorized into the following groups:<br>
Arts and Crafts<br>
Health and Science<br>
Household Arts<br>
Nature<br>
Outdoor Industries<br>
Outreach<br>
Recreation<br>
Vocation<br>
130<br>
A Pathfinder may earn a MASTER AWARD by completing seven<br>
Honors in a given category. After completion of the seven Honors in one<br>
category, the Pathfinder should inform the Path finder director, who will<br>
contact the conference youth ministries director to secure the Master<br>
Award patch. Like the Pathfinder Honors, the Master Award is presented<br>
preferably at a club meeting, campout, school, church, or Investiture. For<br>
additional information and a complete list of Honors see the Path finder<br>

6. Investiture Services.<br>
It is the responsibility of the Pathfinder Club director to a sk the<br>
conference to conduct the Investiture service. Where there is no club, the<br>
church-school teacher places the request. All who are to be invested must<br>
be able to present their Pathfinder Class card to be signed by the<br>
conference youth ministries director prior to the Investiture service.<br>
Records are kept both by the Pathfinder Club secretarvy and the<br>
conference o ffice of all who receive certificates, Honors, and pins.<br>

b. Benefits to the Individual (20 min.)<br>
In this section we emphasize the importance of camping and outdoor<br>
education in the Pathfinder program. It must be emphasized that we are<br>
only discussing basic aspects in this session-the real learning takes place<br>
in the outdoors.<br>
                           <br>
Outdoor living holds a tremendous potential in spiritual values and character-building elements. Campcraft offers great opportunity for practicing democratic group procedures; for building self-reliance, resourcefulness, self-discipline, and respect for other people; for practical application of nature lore and for its greatest appreciation; and best of all – Pathfinders like it. It is therefore recommended that, outdoor living with its multi-skilled requirements compose a large segment of the year's Pathfinder program.<br>
                           <br>
This is especially true when one considers that familiarity with the<br>
wilderness may be a great asset in the days to come. The experience that<br>
is gained through fellowship in camping and the skills developed in<br>
outdoor survival will be very helpful to God's people in the time of<br>
trouble.<br>
                           <br>
2. A perception of nature's blueprint for and interdependent upon of things.<br>
In this age of artificial amusements and synthetic excitement, we<br>
should turn to outdoor recreation. God counsels in Messages to Young<br>
People, pages 380, 381 &quot;There are modes of recreation which are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind. An enlightened,<br>
discrimina ting mind will find abundant means for entertainment and<br>
diversion, from sources not only innocent, but instructive. Recreation<br>
in the open air, the contemplation of the works of God in nature,<br>
will be of the highest benefit.&quot;<br>
Camping provides many opportunities for individual and group<br>
development. Let us discuss these under two headings: Benefits to<br>
the Individual and The Camper's Lifestyle.<br>
                           <br>
1. An intimate knowledge of nature with a love for all her facets which<br>
will never leave and will constantly bring back nostalgic memories<br>
and a longing to be outdoors again.<br>
a each other andg all things in balance<br>
one's place in the scheme<br>
                           <br>
3. A meaningful spiritual awakening that reveals God's presence and<br>
touch in everything as the camper views the majesty of a high<br>
mountain, the peace of a quiet valley, the glory of a colorful sunset,<br>
the glint of sun-light on the lake, or dewdrops glistening on an<br>
intricate spider web.<br>
                           <br>
4. An understanding of the true meaning of conserving natural<br>
resources and the reasons that immediate action is necessary if we<br>
are to save any of the little that remains after so many years of<br>
neglect and destruction by our affluent society, which has<br>
assumed that the supply of natural resources is inexhaustible.<br>
                           <br>
5. A new self-respect and self-confidence as one learns to manage for<br>
oneself and do things others may previously have done for him or her.<br>
Others are too busy with their own jobs to pamper or pick up after<br>
another campe.<br>
                           <br>
6. A pride in one's ability to improvise and make do with what is available.<br>
At camp the Pathfinder cannot run to the store to replace something<br>
damaged or satisfy the whim of the moment.<br>
                           <br>
7. A feeling of at-homeness in the out-of-doors as one learns to use<br>
natural materials, selecting and preparing those best suited to his or her<br>
needs with such simple tools as an axe, knife, or saw.<br>
                           <br>
8. A respect for the dignity of work and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
sweating and struggling to cook over a smoky fire, construct a lean-to<br>
shelter, or build a bridge across a stream.<br>
                           <br>
9. Pride in good health and physical fitness that vigorous outdoor life<br>
brings as it stimulates the camper's lungs and heart, exercises muscles,<br>
and produces an appetite for the simple, nutritious meals cooked out-<br>
doors or planned and served indoors.<br>
                           <br>
10. A new and more realistic sense of values as one notes how unimportant<br>
such things as money, material possessions, IQ, and fine clothes are in<br>
assessing the true worth of an individual. In camp one finds that the<br>
happiest, best liked, and most respected counselors and campers have<br>
spurned outward appearances and material possessions.<br>
                           <br>
11. A feeling of community, pride, and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
serving others, as one maintains the campsite for the benefit of present<br>
and future campers.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>c. Benefits of Camping Activities</em><br>
1. Developing lifetime hobbies and sometimes a vocation. Experience in a<br>
wide variety of activities discloses the canper's interests as well as<br>
aptitudes and broadens his or her perspectives, building unders tanding<br>
and appreciation for the interests of others. Camping aims to develop all-<br>
around abilities rather than specialization in a few, as is so often done in<br>
school sports and other activities in which only a few are chosen to<br>
participate while the majority remain on the sidelines to cheer.<br>
                           <br>
2. Encourages one to try to improve one's own performance. Although<br>
there is enough competition to give those with superior ability a<br>
chance to shine, most of the emphasis is on self-improvement. This<br>
is preferable to the situation in a highly competitive program where<br>
a few nearly always do well and may beconme smug and conceited,<br>
while others are usually well down the scale, become dejected, and<br>
have a &quot; don't care&quot; attitude.<br>
3. Having just plain fun as well as the excitement and new experiences<br>
every normal child craves but doing it in a wholly safe and sane way.<br>
Youngsters who can find the ir thrills this way will never &quot;need&quot; to<br>
resort to stealing, fighting, or killing just for &quot;kicks.&quot;<br>
4. Developing a wholeso me curiosity and desire to investigate and<br>
learn. The whole camp approach is &quot;Let's go and find out.&quot;<br>
5. Learning how to properly balance work, play, rest, and alternate<br>
periods of vigorous activity with those less active; observing regular<br>
hours for rest and sleep.<br>
6. Education on the wise use of leisure time, choo sing activities that<br>
recreate rather than kill time. This fulfills one of society's greatest<br>
needs as leisure time increases and working hours decrease. Many of<br>
the out-of-doors camp activities (canoeing, swimming, hiking,<br>
boating, fishing, camping out, nature study, horseback riding)<br>
provide the interests and skills necessary to take advantage of our<br>
rapidly expanding parks and other recreatio nal facilities. Although<br>
football and basketball may be fine school sports, few will continue<br>
in them after school days are over.<br>
7. Learning to enjoy simple pastimes that don't cost a lot of money as<br>
well as learning to entertain oneself instead of relying on others or<br>
on canned entertainment.<br>
8. Developing appreciation for serious and thoughtful programs by<br>
participating in vespers, observing Sabbath, and enjoying campfire<br>
programs based on thought-provoking themes and rituals.<br>
Spirit of Prophecy quotations:<br>
&quot;Those vwho sacrifice simplicity to fashion, and shut them-selves away<br>
from the beauties of nature, cannot be spiritually minded. They cannot<br>
understand the skill and power of God as revealed in His created works;<br>
therefore their hearts do not quicken and throb with new love and<br>
interest, and they are not filled with awe and reverence as they see God<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
in nature&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 584).<br>
&quot;As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction<br>
into the mind. It is not the conviction that logical reasonings produces;<br>
but unless the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye too dim<br>
to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning is<br>
grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the written word are<br>
impressed on the heart&quot; (Christ's Objet Lessons, p. 24).<br>
&quot;Christ sharply reproved the men of His time because they had not<br>
learned from nature the spiritual lessons which they might have learned.<br>
All things, animate and inanimate, express to man the knowledge of<br>
God&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 580).<br>
&quot;The more quiet and simple the life of the child, – the more free<br>
from artificial excitement and the more in harmony with nature,<br>
the more favorable it is to physical and mental vigor and to spiritual<br>
strength&quot; (Education, p. 107).<br>
&quot;So far as possible, let the child from his earliest years be placed where<br>
this wonderful lesson-book [the book of nature] shall be open be fore<br>
him.... In no other way can the foundation of a true education be so<br>
firmly and surely laid&quot; (Education, p. 100-101).<br>
&quot;From His earliest years He [Jesus] was possessed of one purpose; He<br>
lived to bless others. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas<br>
of ways and means flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and<br>
animal life.<br>
He was trying to understand the reason of things. Heavenly<br>
beings were His attendants, and the culture of holy thoughts and<br>
communings was His. From the first dawning of intelligence He was<br>
constantly growing in spiritual grace and knowledge of truth.<br>
&quot;... Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did&quot; (Desire of Ages, p. 70).<br>
d. Spiritual Values in Camping<br>
Never in the history of the world has so much depended on the spiritual<br>
orientation of youth. And no group of peoplepreachers, teachers, or<br>
parents - has a greater opportunity to direct that orientation than the<br>
people who live with children and adolescents through camping<br>
experiences of the summer months. Lives have been changed in summer<br>
camps. No one goes through a camping experience without its leaving<br>
some mark upon his or her spirit. Whe ther you know it, whether you<br>
desire it, you are going to affect, for good or ill, the spiritual lives of the<br>
young people le vith whom you deal.<br>
In speaking of spiritual values in camping we are not<br>
teachings of any religious group – their doctrine or any form of<br>
worship-but rather with that which will lead us to an experience of<br>
orienting our souls toward God and to ward our fellow men.<br>
Test the spiritual values of your camp life.<br>
1, Closeness to nature<br>
dealing with the<br>
2. The Experience of harmony and order<br>
In camp you build your own shelter of na tive materials, and cook<br>
your own food over an open fire. As you do these things, you are<br>
close to nature and you come to know her as a friend. You climb<br>
hills, discover the treasures of the forest or meadow, make friends<br>
with trees, birds, animals, and even insects. Having this experience<br>
will call out a sense of wonder-the purest approach to the reality of<br>
God.<br>
135<br>
The tragedy of today's living is that we have lived so long in the<br>
presence of the distorted and the abnormal that we actually mistake<br>
abnormality for normality and distortion for real. Think of the world to<br>
which these campers of ours belonga world of blaring radios,<br>
television, gangster comics, torrid movies, wild music, and art without<br>
meaning. Then think of the world to which we are privileged to<br>
introduce them a world of balanced harmony in light and shade,<br>
color variety, trees, and mountains. And all have beauty just in being<br>
themselves.<br>
3. God's great creativeness<br>
If we are to cure the sickness of a maddened world, we must return to<br>
nature for the greatest lessons that God would have us learn. In our<br>
camping experience we come into the presence of God's design.<br>
As we finger clay, dabble with paint, or learn to weave, we do not set<br>
out just to imitate nature. There is within the human spirit that urge that<br>
makes us akin to God– the urge to create out of the deepest<br>
yearnings of our spirit.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
4. Adaptability<br>
Nature is inexorable. Rain falls in spite of our fond desires. But<br>
when we learn to live with nature, to adapt ourselves to her moods,<br>
we find that in every aspect she is beautiful. To a real camper the<br>
circumstances of life become a challenge, and in nature's every<br>
aspect appears the hand of God.<br>
5. Cooperative fellowship<br>
It is here that the camper will discover community. We are members of<br>
one another, and our world is going to disintegrate completely unless<br>
we recognize it. There is also discovered a democracy, the sharing of<br>
responsibility. Democracy also means a leveling process in which at<br>
times the camper may even be able to teach the counselor, and all<br>
artificial distinctions drop away.<br>
CASE STUDIES<br>
How would you solve these problems?<br>
Below are four situations typical of those that could develop in your camp<br>
or during other type of outdoor activities. After studying the case<br>
description, decide which of the statements following it would be the best<br>
solution, and place a check mark before it.<br>
Case One<br>
A counselor and his Path finders make plans for a short hike and<br>
cookout. They plan the menu and divide the responsibilities. At the<br>
campsite, Jerry and Ben go to get firewood while the other boys cook<br>
the meal and tend to their duties. In the space of a few minutes there is<br>
a scream and Ben yells for help. The counselor hurriedly makes his way<br>
to Ben and finds that Jerry has badly cut his leg with the axe. He<br>
administers first aid, and the unit makes its way home with the<br>
wounded boy, their fun spoiled by an accident. What would have been<br>
the best method of preventing this misfortune?<br>
Case Two<br>
The boys should not have been permitted to use the axe.<br>
2. The counselor should have accompanied the boys who<br>
were getting the wood.<br>
3. A project that would have been safer should have been<br>
planned.<br>
4. The boys should have been given better training in the<br>
use of the axe.<br>
The Pathfinder unit decides to go horseback riding with thir<br>
counselor, Anne. All of them have ridden horses before. Anne asks<br>
each of them to walk the horse whenever footing is unsure. All goes<br>
well until they start back to the stables. A short distance from the<br>
stables, on a rocky, downhill trail, Susie, who is riding at the head of<br>
the group, lets her horse break into a trot. The other Path finders follow<br>
Susie's example, but Anne who is the last rider, holds her horse to a<br>
walk and brings up the rear. When Anne arrives at the stables, she<br>
reprimands Susie and tells her she cannot ride with the group again. What<br>
would you have done?<br>
1. Ignored the incident, since no one was injured.<br>
136<br>
2. Ridden at the head of the group.<br>
3. Made the same decision that Anne made.<br>
4. Reprimanded all the Pathfinders and deprived<br>
them of future riding.<br>
Discussed the situation, explaining the reason for the<br>
safety precaution and warn that the infraction should not<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Case Three<br>
Occur again.<br>
A Pathfinder Club is having an overnight camp out by the lake. When the<br>
campfire is over, a movement starts among the group to go for a<br>
moonlight swim.<br>
What should the counselor do?<br>
1. Tell them moonlight swimming is against the rules.<br>
Lecture the group on the dangers, then let them decide.<br>
3. Tell them you wish it were possible, but the hazards<br>
outweigh the pleasure.<br>
4. Say nothing, allow the group to swim, and do your best to<br>
ensure safety.<br>
Case Four<br>
Comments on case: In case three, a situation is presented in which on the<br>
impulse of the moment, Pathfinders suggest an activity having some<br>
grave safety problems. It should be assumed here that the leadership<br>
has decided that the dangers outweigh the advantages. It is a question<br>
of the Club director and staff bcing able to pres<br>
esent convincing and<br>
sound reasons for refusing the request. It would also be wise to<br>
substitute some other safe activity in place of the moonlight swim. It is<br>
a case in which the staff should carefully canvas the possibilities and<br>
anticipate such a tum of events, getting the group to agree to a program that<br>
John is the counselor of a unit that has asked for an overnight hike, which will<br>
mean the preparation of two meals out-of-doors. Although most of the<br>
members have been on similar trips before, John does not feel that he is<br>
qualified to lead his group on the proposed trip.<br>
What should he do?<br>
1. Aska more experienced counselor in campcraft to accompany him<br>
and his group?<br>
2. Persuade his unit to take a less extensive trip that he is more<br>
capable of leading?<br>
3. Refuse to consider the trip?<br>
_4. Go with the group and learn as he goes?<br>
Comments on Case: Counselors need to have had experience in outdoor skills<br>
before leading a unit. In this case, John is unfortunate to have been caught in a<br>
situation in which he feels unquali fied to lead his group on a proposed trip. A<br>
counselor's influence with his group is enhanced when he demonstrates skills<br>
that are applauded by the group. It would be well for him to go out into his<br>
138<br>
own backyard and cook a meal or two, and then go with the group and learn<br>
as he goes.<br>
did not include a oonlight swim.<br>

As leaders, you may think the above suggestions are too organized, but<br>
remember that young people like to be active; if they are not active they<br>
will get into mischief. Also remember that Satan finds something for idle<br>
hands to do.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Guidelines for a Good Campout<br>
1. General rules for running the campout<br>
a, Insist on absolute consideration for the other person, As a result there<br>
will be no practical jokes, the person and property of each will be out<br>
of bounds for all others; all camp chores will be shared; the nights will<br>
be quiet; sanitation and personal cleanliness are a must. Tents are not<br>
disturbed.<br>
b. Everyone will take part in all the activities, including discussions,<br>
worship, instruction, and practical learning. Teaming up is half the fun.<br>
C. Be sure that all campers and staff recognize that God is camped with<br>
us. This will show in our words and attitudes. Any Sabbath kept during<br>
the campout will show our loyalty to God. We will all join in thoughtful<br>
worship, morning and evening. The natural surro undings will be cared<br>
for as His contribution to our pleasure.<br>
2. What to bring<br>
a. Hiking clothes, including boots and rain gear, suitable to enjoy<br>
water, mud, sun, rain, without worry of ruining them<br>
b. Change of clothing for night wear or emergency; including an extra<br>
warm sweater<br>
c. Food as listed, eating and cooking gear, cleaning up needs<br>
d. Sleeping bag, ground cover, compass, flashlight (able to throwa<br>
good beam for several hours)<br>
e. Bible, pamphlet, notebook, ball point pen, personal First-aid kit<br>
f. Personal cleanliness needs, including toilet paper<br>
g. Humor, patience, helpfulness, determination to make it a good<br>
trip for all<br>
3. Cooking arrangements<br>
a. Most easily done on a portable stove that may be used in a tent or<br>
under wet conditions.<br>
b. Cook in pairs, sharing some utensils but campers should pack own<br>
food supplies<br>
4. On the go<br>
a. Time your hiking to arrive at suitable campsites (water, shelter, level<br>
ground) by Haismi th's Rule.<br>
Easy going<br>
Easy scrambling<br>
Rough country, deep sand,<br>
soft snow, thick bush<br>
4.8 km/hr (3 mph/hr)<br>
3 km/hr (2 mph/hr)<br>
141<br>
1.6 km/hr (1 mph/hr)<br>
For every hour over five hours allow one hour for fatigue. For<br>
very fit and experienced walkers reduce time by one-third.<br>
b. Train yourself mentally and physically to enjoy all types of weather and<br>
terrain. Practice coping safely with night walking, river crossing,<br>
exposure conditions, vertical dimbs, and sleeping on the ground. Learn<br>
all you can from experienced hikers.<br>
C. Keep a clear personal log, making your own map and compass<br>
readings to be responsible for your own safety. Do your own<br>
mapping where neces sary. If conditions limit accuracy, state<br>
approximately how accurate your information is.<br>
d. Fill in log books in huts you pass to facilitate any Search and<br>
Rescue operation, should such be necessary.<br>
e. Notice the thrill of overcoming the unreasonable dislike of<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
f. Get used to the weight of boots, the feel of wool next to the skin,<br>
the full pack on your back, and the sense of responsibility that<br>
goes with such freedom.<br>
g. Develop the attitude that you are an invited visitor into God's world.<br>
He made it for you. Enjoy it!<br>
5. When you come back<br>
discomfort, wet clothes, muddy skins, darkness, solitude. You're<br>
tougher than you think.<br>
a. Sort out your pack into:<br>
C.<br>
b. Next time look after the ounces (grams) and the pounds<br>
(kilos) will look after themselves.<br>
(1) What you actually used<br>
FOOD<br>
(2) What you could use from your observations<br>
(3) What you now know you'll never use (discard it)<br>
d. The benefits of such an experience will be felt long after the scars<br>
have healed!<br>
Be thankful.<br>

A Good Pathfinder Will<br>
Be conservation-minded<br>
I will help when and where I can to conserve our forests, waters,<br>
minerals, soil, grasslands, and wildlife.<br>
Be careful with fire<br>
I will build my fire in a safe place and keep it under control, and<br>
will be sure my fire is out before leaving it.<br>
Be clean in the out-of-doors<br>
I will not disturb the natural beauty by leaving my trash and<br>
garbage. I will not pollute rivers or streams.<br>
Be considerate of property<br>
144<br>
I will respect public and private property and do no damage. I<br>
will take nothing but photographs. I will leave nothing but<br>
footprints.<br>

                           <br>
3. Types of Camping<br>
Let's look now at two basic types of camping.<br>
a. Site camps<br>
b. Trave ling camps<br>
It is said, &quot;Variety is the spice of life.&quot; While this is not always true, it is<br>
fairly true of camping. To do the same thing over and over becomes<br>
monotonous and boring. Path finders, while they enjoy camping and will<br>
stick with the program, like adventure, challenge, and development of new<br>
skills. This is especially applicable to the older age group. The harder the<br>
challenge the more enjoyment they seem to get, especially when the<br>
challenge can be accomplished. It is damaging to set before a young person<br>
a goal that you know cannot be achieved. Always set realistic goals.<br>
&quot;Static&quot;<br>
The goals you set are determined by the type of camp you have. If you plan<br>
to teach your group abseiling or rappeling, then don't wear them out by<br>
having hiking, biking, canoeing, or other types of physically exhausting<br>
camps. Plan to concentrate your efforts in both theory and practice on<br>
achieving the goal. A site camp would be preferable for this goal, with<br>
transport readily available in an emergency. Try to achieve ONE major goal<br>
in a campout with subsidiary goals that point to the major goal.<br>
Remember that your site must be che cked out beforehand so that the goal<br>
you hope to achieve will be realized. Goals determine the site.<br>
Don't always find a nice site then work your campouts around that site.<br>
Good sites are hard to come by and it is easy to plan a camp once you have<br>
a site, but invariably you will find that the type of camp you offer will<br>
become stereotyped. This is all right for a new Club or for new Pathfinders,<br>
but it is not satisfactory for older members or for you as a leader to<br>
continue to do this. Both your older Pathfinders and your own initiative will<br>
soon be in a rut and the excitement of new horizons will become lost. Have<br>
you ever wondered, &quot;Why do kids enjoy camping so much when it seems<br>
such a lot of hard work and inconvenience?&quot; It just might be that you are<br>
already experiencing this syndrome. Plan to do something exciting,<br>
something different, and your enthusiasm will challenge the older Path-<br>
finders.<br>
a. Site Camp<br>
Let us list some of the types of camps that you could organize.<br>
It is good to have at least one each year. A site camp is simply a camp to<br>
which you drive your vehicles, erect your tents, camp at the samne place,<br>
then drive home at the conclusion of the camp. All activities focus<br>
around the site.<br>
These campouts are really good in that they help you to achieve a<br>
whole variety of things such as:<br>
Pathfinder classwork<br>
Swimming Honors<br>
Rock Climbing<br>
Hiking<br>
Fire building<br>
...20 (min.)<br>
Nature Honors<br>
(trees, ferns, flowers, etc.)<br>
Signaling<br>
Camperaft Honors<br>
Bible camps<br>
Axemanship<br>
Track and trail<br>
Lashings/knots<br>
Fire Building<br>
Orienteering<br>
146<br>
Make sure that there is a purpose to each campout you have, and that<br>
people are there with sufficient knowledge in particular areas to help<br>
you realize that purpose. Don't make your goal &quot;to have a good time.&quot;<br>
This must be a by-product of your camp, rather than an end in itself.<br>
Meeting new challenges, seeing new horizons, and developing new skills<br>
(which is cducation) providcs advcnturc that will cnsurc that cverybody<br>
has a good time. The balance betwveen what is done in 1) the theoretical<br>
way, and 2) a practical way, will largely determine the &quot;great time&quot; that<br>
was had.<br>
Don't overburden with theory, but make sure that sufficient has been<br>
learned to avoid pitfalls. They say &quot;a fool learns by his own mistakes<br>
but a wise man learns from the mistakes of fools.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
b. Traveling Camps<br>
These camps move from one location to another and are designed to<br>
bring out initiative, reso urcefulness, courage, strength, and ability while<br>
putting into practice the things a Pathfinder has learned. Site camps can<br>
do this, too, but there is a challenge and a sense of achievement and<br>
adventure that can be gained on a traveling campout that cannot be<br>
achieved on a site campout. A Pathfinder has to learn to depend on his<br>
or her physical well being, knowledge and equipment to a far greater<br>
capacity, and in all these things sees the hand of God more clearly<br>
revealed. When you are halfway between point A and B, and are<br>
exhausted and feel that one more step will be your last, it is then that :<br>
person realizes his or her extremity and reaches out for help. At the<br>
conclusion of the campout that person has achieved the seemingly<br>
impossible but is determined to be more physically fit, have better<br>
equipment, and know more of what is to be done the next time.<br>
It is important to encourage the ones who drift to the rear and slow<br>
those who race to the front. The first hour or two will usually indicate<br>
what the general pattern will be, and it is important to check it before it<br>
gets out of control. It is wise to make an announcement that &quot;someone<br>
(who knows the way) will lead and &quot;'someone will bring up the rear. All<br>
Pathfinders must then be contained between these two leaders. This<br>
must be strictly enforced for the first day or two, depending on how long<br>
the group is going to travel. Nothing is more psychologically devastating<br>
to a traveling camper than to be always at the end of the line, and who<br>
knows what trouble they could be in if left to struggle while everyone<br>
else tears ahead. Sometimes these campers need to be put to the front.<br>
It is amazing how much faster they travel when they take the lead. It is<br>
not wise to scold, for that will cause even more disco uragement. It is<br>
better to play psychological games with everyone, thus encouraging all<br>
to be more helpful.<br>
The person who consistently barges ahead in the lead must be held back. He<br>
or she can get into all sorts of difficulty, and may be involved in an<br>
accident or get lost by such foolhardiness. That person also needs<br>
encouragement in being helpful to the group. Maybe he or she could carry a<br>
bit of extra weight from the slower ones or help the slower ones by walking<br>
with them and thus encouraging them or ministering to their needs.<br>
Whatever happens, it is essential that the group be contained and move<br>
forward as a group.<br>
It is important that all equipment taken on a travel campout be of good<br>
quality. Repairs along the way often make the poor quality article worse.<br>
Sometimes something can be rendered irreparable on the first day and<br>
you are then stuck without<br>

b. Benefits to the Individual (20 min.)<br>
In this section we emphasize the importance of camping and outdoor<br>
education in the Pathfinder program. It must be emphasized that we are<br>
only discussing basic aspects in this session-the real learning takes place<br>
in the outdoors.<br>
                           <br>
Outdoor living holds a tremendous potential in spiritual values and character-building elements. Campcraft offers great opportunity for practicing democratic group procedures; for building self-reliance, resourcefulness, self-discipline, and respect for other people; for practical application of nature lore and for its greatest appreciation; and best of all – Pathfinders like it. It is therefore recommended that, outdoor living with its multi-skilled requirements compose a large segment of the year's Pathfinder program.<br>
                           <br>
This is especially true when one considers that familiarity with the<br>
wilderness may be a great asset in the days to come. The experience that<br>
is gained through fellowship in camping and the skills developed in<br>
outdoor survival will be very helpful to God's people in the time of<br>
trouble.<br>
                           <br>
2. A perception of nature's blueprint for and interdependent upon of things.<br>
In this age of artificial amusements and synthetic excitement, we<br>
should turn to outdoor recreation. God counsels in Messages to Young<br>
People, pages 380, 381 &quot;There are modes of recreation which are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind. An enlightened,<br>
discrimina ting mind will find abundant means for entertainment and<br>
diversion, from sources not only innocent, but instructive. Recreation<br>
in the open air, the contemplation of the works of God in nature,<br>
will be of the highest benefit.&quot;<br>
Camping provides many opportunities for individual and group<br>
development. Let us discuss these under two headings: Benefits to<br>
the Individual and The Camper's Lifestyle.<br>
                           <br>
1. An intimate knowledge of nature with a love for all her facets which<br>
will never leave and will constantly bring back nostalgic memories<br>
and a longing to be outdoors again.<br>
a each other andg all things in balance<br>
one's place in the scheme<br>
                           <br>
3. A meaningful spiritual awakening that reveals God's presence and<br>
touch in everything as the camper views the majesty of a high<br>
mountain, the peace of a quiet valley, the glory of a colorful sunset,<br>
the glint of sun-light on the lake, or dewdrops glistening on an<br>
intricate spider web.<br>
                           <br>
4. An understanding of the true meaning of conserving natural<br>
resources and the reasons that immediate action is necessary if we<br>
are to save any of the little that remains after so many years of<br>
neglect and destruction by our affluent society, which has<br>
assumed that the supply of natural resources is inexhaustible.<br>
                           <br>
5. A new self-respect and self-confidence as one learns to manage for<br>
oneself and do things others may previously have done for him or her.<br>
Others are too busy with their own jobs to pamper or pick up after<br>
another campe.<br>
                           <br>
6. A pride in one's ability to improvise and make do with what is available.<br>
At camp the Pathfinder cannot run to the store to replace something<br>
damaged or satisfy the whim of the moment.<br>
                           <br>
7. A feeling of at-homeness in the out-of-doors as one learns to use<br>
natural materials, selecting and preparing those best suited to his or her<br>
needs with such simple tools as an axe, knife, or saw.<br>
                           <br>
8. A respect for the dignity of work and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
sweating and struggling to cook over a smoky fire, construct a lean-to<br>
shelter, or build a bridge across a stream.<br>
                           <br>
9. Pride in good health and physical fitness that vigorous outdoor life<br>
brings as it stimulates the camper's lungs and heart, exercises muscles,<br>
and produces an appetite for the simple, nutritious meals cooked out-<br>
doors or planned and served indoors.<br>
                           <br>
10. A new and more realistic sense of values as one notes how unimportant<br>
such things as money, material possessions, IQ, and fine clothes are in<br>
assessing the true worth of an individual. In camp one finds that the<br>
happiest, best liked, and most respected counselors and campers have<br>
spurned outward appearances and material possessions.<br>
                           <br>
11. A feeling of community, pride, and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
serving others, as one maintains the campsite for the benefit of present<br>
and future campers.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>c. Benefits of Camping Activities</em><br>
1. Developing lifetime hobbies and sometimes a vocation. Experience in a<br>
wide variety of activities discloses the canper's interests as well as<br>
aptitudes and broadens his or her perspectives, building unders tanding<br>
and appreciation for the interests of others. Camping aims to develop all-<br>
around abilities rather than specialization in a few, as is so often done in<br>
school sports and other activities in which only a few are chosen to<br>
participate while the majority remain on the sidelines to cheer.<br>
                           <br>
2. Encourages one to try to improve one's own performance. Although<br>
there is enough competition to give those with superior ability a<br>
chance to shine, most of the emphasis is on self-improvement. This<br>
is preferable to the situation in a highly competitive program where<br>
a few nearly always do well and may beconme smug and conceited,<br>
while others are usually well down the scale, become dejected, and<br>
have a &quot; don't care&quot; attitude.<br>
3. Having just plain fun as well as the excitement and new experiences<br>
every normal child craves but doing it in a wholly safe and sane way.<br>
Youngsters who can find the ir thrills this way will never &quot;need&quot; to<br>
resort to stealing, fighting, or killing just for &quot;kicks.&quot;<br>
4. Developing a wholeso me curiosity and desire to investigate and<br>
learn. The whole camp approach is &quot;Let's go and find out.&quot;<br>
5. Learning how to properly balance work, play, rest, and alternate<br>
periods of vigorous activity with those less active; observing regular<br>
hours for rest and sleep.<br>
6. Education on the wise use of leisure time, choo sing activities that<br>
recreate rather than kill time. This fulfills one of society's greatest<br>
needs as leisure time increases and working hours decrease. Many of<br>
the out-of-doors camp activities (canoeing, swimming, hiking,<br>
boating, fishing, camping out, nature study, horseback riding)<br>
provide the interests and skills necessary to take advantage of our<br>
rapidly expanding parks and other recreatio nal facilities. Although<br>
football and basketball may be fine school sports, few will continue<br>
in them after school days are over.<br>
7. Learning to enjoy simple pastimes that don't cost a lot of money as<br>
well as learning to entertain oneself instead of relying on others or<br>
on canned entertainment.<br>
8. Developing appreciation for serious and thoughtful programs by<br>
participating in vespers, observing Sabbath, and enjoying campfire<br>
programs based on thought-provoking themes and rituals.<br>
Spirit of Prophecy quotations:<br>
&quot;Those vwho sacrifice simplicity to fashion, and shut them-selves away<br>
from the beauties of nature, cannot be spiritually minded. They cannot<br>
understand the skill and power of God as revealed in His created works;<br>
therefore their hearts do not quicken and throb with new love and<br>
interest, and they are not filled with awe and reverence as they see God<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
in nature&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 584).<br>
&quot;As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction<br>
into the mind. It is not the conviction that logical reasonings produces;<br>
but unless the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye too dim<br>
to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning is<br>
grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the written word are<br>
impressed on the heart&quot; (Christ's Objet Lessons, p. 24).<br>
&quot;Christ sharply reproved the men of His time because they had not<br>
learned from nature the spiritual lessons which they might have learned.<br>
All things, animate and inanimate, express to man the knowledge of<br>
God&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 580).<br>
&quot;The more quiet and simple the life of the child, – the more free<br>
from artificial excitement and the more in harmony with nature,<br>
the more favorable it is to physical and mental vigor and to spiritual<br>
strength&quot; (Education, p. 107).<br>
&quot;So far as possible, let the child from his earliest years be placed where<br>
this wonderful lesson-book [the book of nature] shall be open be fore<br>
him.... In no other way can the foundation of a true education be so<br>
firmly and surely laid&quot; (Education, p. 100-101).<br>
&quot;From His earliest years He [Jesus] was possessed of one purpose; He<br>
lived to bless others. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas<br>
of ways and means flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and<br>
animal life.<br>
He was trying to understand the reason of things. Heavenly<br>
beings were His attendants, and the culture of holy thoughts and<br>
communings was His. From the first dawning of intelligence He was<br>
constantly growing in spiritual grace and knowledge of truth.<br>
&quot;... Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did&quot; (Desire of Ages, p. 70).<br>
d. Spiritual Values in Camping<br>
Never in the history of the world has so much depended on the spiritual<br>
orientation of youth. And no group of peoplepreachers, teachers, or<br>
parents - has a greater opportunity to direct that orientation than the<br>
people who live with children and adolescents through camping<br>
experiences of the summer months. Lives have been changed in summer<br>
camps. No one goes through a camping experience without its leaving<br>
some mark upon his or her spirit. Whe ther you know it, whether you<br>
desire it, you are going to affect, for good or ill, the spiritual lives of the<br>
young people le vith whom you deal.<br>
In speaking of spiritual values in camping we are not<br>
teachings of any religious group – their doctrine or any form of<br>
worship-but rather with that which will lead us to an experience of<br>
orienting our souls toward God and to ward our fellow men.<br>
Test the spiritual values of your camp life.<br>
1, Closeness to nature<br>
dealing with the<br>
2. The Experience of harmony and order<br>
In camp you build your own shelter of na tive materials, and cook<br>
your own food over an open fire. As you do these things, you are<br>
close to nature and you come to know her as a friend. You climb<br>
hills, discover the treasures of the forest or meadow, make friends<br>
with trees, birds, animals, and even insects. Having this experience<br>
will call out a sense of wonder-the purest approach to the reality of<br>
God.<br>
135<br>
The tragedy of today's living is that we have lived so long in the<br>
presence of the distorted and the abnormal that we actually mistake<br>
abnormality for normality and distortion for real. Think of the world to<br>
which these campers of ours belonga world of blaring radios,<br>
television, gangster comics, torrid movies, wild music, and art without<br>
meaning. Then think of the world to which we are privileged to<br>
introduce them a world of balanced harmony in light and shade,<br>
color variety, trees, and mountains. And all have beauty just in being<br>
themselves.<br>
3. God's great creativeness<br>
If we are to cure the sickness of a maddened world, we must return to<br>
nature for the greatest lessons that God would have us learn. In our<br>
camping experience we come into the presence of God's design.<br>
As we finger clay, dabble with paint, or learn to weave, we do not set<br>
out just to imitate nature. There is within the human spirit that urge that<br>
makes us akin to God– the urge to create out of the deepest<br>
yearnings of our spirit.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
4. Adaptability<br>
Nature is inexorable. Rain falls in spite of our fond desires. But<br>
when we learn to live with nature, to adapt ourselves to her moods,<br>
we find that in every aspect she is beautiful. To a real camper the<br>
circumstances of life become a challenge, and in nature's every<br>
aspect appears the hand of God.<br>
5. Cooperative fellowship<br>
It is here that the camper will discover community. We are members of<br>
one another, and our world is going to disintegrate completely unless<br>
we recognize it. There is also discovered a democracy, the sharing of<br>
responsibility. Democracy also means a leveling process in which at<br>
times the camper may even be able to teach the counselor, and all<br>
artificial distinctions drop away.<br>
CASE STUDIES<br>
How would you solve these problems?<br>
Below are four situations typical of those that could develop in your camp<br>
or during other type of outdoor activities. After studying the case<br>
description, decide which of the statements following it would be the best<br>
solution, and place a check mark before it.<br>
Case One<br>
A counselor and his Path finders make plans for a short hike and<br>
cookout. They plan the menu and divide the responsibilities. At the<br>
campsite, Jerry and Ben go to get firewood while the other boys cook<br>
the meal and tend to their duties. In the space of a few minutes there is<br>
a scream and Ben yells for help. The counselor hurriedly makes his way<br>
to Ben and finds that Jerry has badly cut his leg with the axe. He<br>
administers first aid, and the unit makes its way home with the<br>
wounded boy, their fun spoiled by an accident. What would have been<br>
the best method of preventing this misfortune?<br>
Case Two<br>
The boys should not have been permitted to use the axe.<br>
2. The counselor should have accompanied the boys who<br>
were getting the wood.<br>
3. A project that would have been safer should have been<br>
planned.<br>
4. The boys should have been given better training in the<br>
use of the axe.<br>
The Pathfinder unit decides to go horseback riding with thir<br>
counselor, Anne. All of them have ridden horses before. Anne asks<br>
each of them to walk the horse whenever footing is unsure. All goes<br>
well until they start back to the stables. A short distance from the<br>
stables, on a rocky, downhill trail, Susie, who is riding at the head of<br>
the group, lets her horse break into a trot. The other Path finders follow<br>
Susie's example, but Anne who is the last rider, holds her horse to a<br>
walk and brings up the rear. When Anne arrives at the stables, she<br>
reprimands Susie and tells her she cannot ride with the group again. What<br>
would you have done?<br>
1. Ignored the incident, since no one was injured.<br>
136<br>
2. Ridden at the head of the group.<br>
3. Made the same decision that Anne made.<br>
4. Reprimanded all the Pathfinders and deprived<br>
them of future riding.<br>
Discussed the situation, explaining the reason for the<br>
safety precaution and warn that the infraction should not<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Case Three<br>
Occur again.<br>
A Pathfinder Club is having an overnight camp out by the lake. When the<br>
campfire is over, a movement starts among the group to go for a<br>
moonlight swim.<br>
What should the counselor do?<br>
1. Tell them moonlight swimming is against the rules.<br>
Lecture the group on the dangers, then let them decide.<br>
3. Tell them you wish it were possible, but the hazards<br>
outweigh the pleasure.<br>
4. Say nothing, allow the group to swim, and do your best to<br>
ensure safety.<br>
Case Four<br>
Comments on case: In case three, a situation is presented in which on the<br>
impulse of the moment, Pathfinders suggest an activity having some<br>
grave safety problems. It should be assumed here that the leadership<br>
has decided that the dangers outweigh the advantages. It is a question<br>
of the Club director and staff bcing able to pres<br>
esent convincing and<br>
sound reasons for refusing the request. It would also be wise to<br>
substitute some other safe activity in place of the moonlight swim. It is<br>
a case in which the staff should carefully canvas the possibilities and<br>
anticipate such a tum of events, getting the group to agree to a program that<br>
John is the counselor of a unit that has asked for an overnight hike, which will<br>
mean the preparation of two meals out-of-doors. Although most of the<br>
members have been on similar trips before, John does not feel that he is<br>
qualified to lead his group on the proposed trip.<br>
What should he do?<br>
1. Aska more experienced counselor in campcraft to accompany him<br>
and his group?<br>
2. Persuade his unit to take a less extensive trip that he is more<br>
capable of leading?<br>
3. Refuse to consider the trip?<br>
_4. Go with the group and learn as he goes?<br>
Comments on Case: Counselors need to have had experience in outdoor skills<br>
before leading a unit. In this case, John is unfortunate to have been caught in a<br>
situation in which he feels unquali fied to lead his group on a proposed trip. A<br>
counselor's influence with his group is enhanced when he demonstrates skills<br>
that are applauded by the group. It would be well for him to go out into his<br>
138<br>
own backyard and cook a meal or two, and then go with the group and learn<br>
as he goes.<br>

Planning a Camp<br>
In Pathfinder Clubs, camping and outdoor activities are a necessity and are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind.<br>
It is our aim to give you a sample of what is required of each leader in<br>
planning a campout. These suggestions will prove beneficial to all who<br>
plan and those who participate, making your camp not only successful<br>
but enjoyable.<br>

As leaders, you may think the above suggestions are too organized, but<br>
remember that young people like to be active; if they are not active they<br>
will get into mischief. Also remember that Satan finds something for idle<br>
hands to do.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Guidelines for a Good Campout<br>
1. General rules for running the campout<br>
a, Insist on absolute consideration for the other person, As a result there<br>
will be no practical jokes, the person and property of each will be out<br>
of bounds for all others; all camp chores will be shared; the nights will<br>
be quiet; sanitation and personal cleanliness are a must. Tents are not<br>
disturbed.<br>
b. Everyone will take part in all the activities, including discussions,<br>
worship, instruction, and practical learning. Teaming up is half the fun.<br>
C. Be sure that all campers and staff recognize that God is camped with<br>
us. This will show in our words and attitudes. Any Sabbath kept during<br>
the campout will show our loyalty to God. We will all join in thoughtful<br>
worship, morning and evening. The natural surro undings will be cared<br>
for as His contribution to our pleasure.<br>
2. What to bring<br>
a. Hiking clothes, including boots and rain gear, suitable to enjoy<br>
water, mud, sun, rain, without worry of ruining them<br>
b. Change of clothing for night wear or emergency; including an extra<br>
warm sweater<br>
c. Food as listed, eating and cooking gear, cleaning up needs<br>
d. Sleeping bag, ground cover, compass, flashlight (able to throwa<br>
good beam for several hours)<br>
e. Bible, pamphlet, notebook, ball point pen, personal First-aid kit<br>
f. Personal cleanliness needs, including toilet paper<br>
g. Humor, patience, helpfulness, determination to make it a good<br>
trip for all<br>
3. Cooking arrangements<br>
a. Most easily done on a portable stove that may be used in a tent or<br>
under wet conditions.<br>
b. Cook in pairs, sharing some utensils but campers should pack own<br>
food supplies<br>
4. On the go<br>
a. Time your hiking to arrive at suitable campsites (water, shelter, level<br>
ground) by Haismi th's Rule.<br>
Easy going<br>
Easy scrambling<br>
Rough country, deep sand,<br>
soft snow, thick bush<br>
4.8 km/hr (3 mph/hr)<br>
3 km/hr (2 mph/hr)<br>
141<br>
1.6 km/hr (1 mph/hr)<br>
For every hour over five hours allow one hour for fatigue. For<br>
very fit and experienced walkers reduce time by one-third.<br>
b. Train yourself mentally and physically to enjoy all types of weather and<br>
terrain. Practice coping safely with night walking, river crossing,<br>
exposure conditions, vertical dimbs, and sleeping on the ground. Learn<br>
all you can from experienced hikers.<br>
C. Keep a clear personal log, making your own map and compass<br>
readings to be responsible for your own safety. Do your own<br>
mapping where neces sary. If conditions limit accuracy, state<br>
approximately how accurate your information is.<br>
d. Fill in log books in huts you pass to facilitate any Search and<br>
Rescue operation, should such be necessary.<br>
e. Notice the thrill of overcoming the unreasonable dislike of<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
f. Get used to the weight of boots, the feel of wool next to the skin,<br>
the full pack on your back, and the sense of responsibility that<br>
goes with such freedom.<br>
g. Develop the attitude that you are an invited visitor into God's world.<br>
He made it for you. Enjoy it!<br>
5. When you come back<br>
discomfort, wet clothes, muddy skins, darkness, solitude. You're<br>
tougher than you think.<br>
a. Sort out your pack into:<br>
C.<br>
b. Next time look after the ounces (grams) and the pounds<br>
(kilos) will look after themselves.<br>
(1) What you actually used<br>
FOOD<br>
(2) What you could use from your observations<br>
(3) What you now know you'll never use (discard it)<br>
d. The benefits of such an experience will be felt long after the scars<br>
have healed!<br>
Be thankful.<br>

Country Code<br>
When on a hike, participants should observe the following<br>
&quot;Country Code.&quot;<br>
1. Contact the local police station if undertaking an expedition in<br>
unpopulated areas or for a lengthy period of time.<br>
2. Guard against all risks of fire. Check on fire bans with local<br>
police.<br>
3. Leave gates the same way you found them.<br>
4. Keep dogs and/or horses under proper control.<br>
5. Leave no litter. What goes out full can return empty.<br>
6. Avoid damaging fences, gates, etc.<br>
7. Ask permission to use private property BEFORE the<br>
expedition.<br>
8. Check and safeguard water supplies.<br>
9. Travel carefully on country roads.<br>
10. Protect wildlife, plants, and trees.<br>
11. Respect life of the countryside.<br>
NOTE: Permission must be obtained from the owner BEFORE<br>
the expedition to camp on private property.<br>
A Good Pathfinder Will<br>
Be conservation-minded<br>
I will help when and where I can to conserve our forests, waters,<br>
minerals, soil, grasslands, and wildlife.<br>
Be careful with fire<br>
I will build my fire in a safe place and keep it under control, and<br>
will be sure my fire is out before leaving it.<br>
Be clean in the out-of-doors<br>
I will not disturb the natural beauty by leaving my trash and<br>
garbage. I will not pollute rivers or streams.<br>
Be considerate of property<br>
144<br>
I will respect public and private property and do no damage. I<br>
will take nothing but photographs. I will leave nothing but<br>
footprints.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
3. Types of Camping<br>
Let's look now at two basic types of camping.<br>
a. Site camps<br>
b. Trave ling camps<br>
It is said, &quot;Variety is the spice of life.&quot; While this is not always true, it is<br>
fairly true of camping. To do the same thing over and over becomes<br>
monotonous and boring. Path finders, while they enjoy camping and will<br>
stick with the program, like adventure, challenge, and development of new<br>
skills. This is especially applicable to the older age group. The harder the<br>
challenge the more enjoyment they seem to get, especially when the<br>
challenge can be accomplished. It is damaging to set before a young person<br>
a goal that you know cannot be achieved. Always set realistic goals.<br>
&quot;Static&quot;<br>
The goals you set are determined by the type of camp you have. If you plan<br>
to teach your group abseiling or rappeling, then don't wear them out by<br>
having hiking, biking, canoeing, or other types of physically exhausting<br>
camps. Plan to concentrate your efforts in both theory and practice on<br>
achieving the goal. A site camp would be preferable for this goal, with<br>
transport readily available in an emergency. Try to achieve ONE major goal<br>
in a campout with subsidiary goals that point to the major goal.<br>
Remember that your site must be che cked out beforehand so that the goal<br>
you hope to achieve will be realized. Goals determine the site.<br>
Don't always find a nice site then work your campouts around that site.<br>
Good sites are hard to come by and it is easy to plan a camp once you have<br>
a site, but invariably you will find that the type of camp you offer will<br>
become stereotyped. This is all right for a new Club or for new Pathfinders,<br>
but it is not satisfactory for older members or for you as a leader to<br>
continue to do this. Both your older Pathfinders and your own initiative will<br>
soon be in a rut and the excitement of new horizons will become lost. Have<br>
you ever wondered, &quot;Why do kids enjoy camping so much when it seems<br>
such a lot of hard work and inconvenience?&quot; It just might be that you are<br>
already experiencing this syndrome. Plan to do something exciting,<br>
something different, and your enthusiasm will challenge the older Path-<br>
finders.<br>
a. Site Camp<br>
Let us list some of the types of camps that you could organize.<br>
It is good to have at least one each year. A site camp is simply a camp to<br>
which you drive your vehicles, erect your tents, camp at the samne place,<br>
then drive home at the conclusion of the camp. All activities focus<br>
around the site.<br>
These campouts are really good in that they help you to achieve a<br>
whole variety of things such as:<br>
Pathfinder classwork<br>
Swimming Honors<br>
Rock Climbing<br>
Hiking<br>
Fire building<br>
...20 (min.)<br>
Nature Honors<br>
(trees, ferns, flowers, etc.)<br>
Signaling<br>
Camperaft Honors<br>
Bible camps<br>
Axemanship<br>
Track and trail<br>
Lashings/knots<br>
Fire Building<br>
Orienteering<br>
146<br>
Make sure that there is a purpose to each campout you have, and that<br>
people are there with sufficient knowledge in particular areas to help<br>
you realize that purpose. Don't make your goal &quot;to have a good time.&quot;<br>
This must be a by-product of your camp, rather than an end in itself.<br>
Meeting new challenges, seeing new horizons, and developing new skills<br>
(which is cducation) providcs advcnturc that will cnsurc that cverybody<br>
has a good time. The balance betwveen what is done in 1) the theoretical<br>
way, and 2) a practical way, will largely determine the &quot;great time&quot; that<br>
was had.<br>
Don't overburden with theory, but make sure that sufficient has been<br>
learned to avoid pitfalls. They say &quot;a fool learns by his own mistakes<br>
but a wise man learns from the mistakes of fools.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
b. Traveling Camps<br>
These camps move from one location to another and are designed to<br>
bring out initiative, reso urcefulness, courage, strength, and ability while<br>
putting into practice the things a Pathfinder has learned. Site camps can<br>
do this, too, but there is a challenge and a sense of achievement and<br>
adventure that can be gained on a traveling campout that cannot be<br>
achieved on a site campout. A Pathfinder has to learn to depend on his<br>
or her physical well being, knowledge and equipment to a far greater<br>
capacity, and in all these things sees the hand of God more clearly<br>
revealed. When you are halfway between point A and B, and are<br>
exhausted and feel that one more step will be your last, it is then that :<br>
person realizes his or her extremity and reaches out for help. At the<br>
conclusion of the campout that person has achieved the seemingly<br>
impossible but is determined to be more physically fit, have better<br>
equipment, and know more of what is to be done the next time.<br>
It is important to encourage the ones who drift to the rear and slow<br>
those who race to the front. The first hour or two will usually indicate<br>
what the general pattern will be, and it is important to check it before it<br>
gets out of control. It is wise to make an announcement that &quot;someone<br>
(who knows the way) will lead and &quot;'someone will bring up the rear. All<br>
Pathfinders must then be contained between these two leaders. This<br>
must be strictly enforced for the first day or two, depending on how long<br>
the group is going to travel. Nothing is more psychologically devastating<br>
to a traveling camper than to be always at the end of the line, and who<br>
knows what trouble they could be in if left to struggle while everyone<br>
else tears ahead. Sometimes these campers need to be put to the front.<br>
It is amazing how much faster they travel when they take the lead. It is<br>
not wise to scold, for that will cause even more disco uragement. It is<br>
better to play psychological games with everyone, thus encouraging all<br>
to be more helpful.<br>
The person who consistently barges ahead in the lead must be held back. He<br>
or she can get into all sorts of difficulty, and may be involved in an<br>
accident or get lost by such foolhardiness. That person also needs<br>
encouragement in being helpful to the group. Maybe he or she could carry a<br>
bit of extra weight from the slower ones or help the slower ones by walking<br>
with them and thus encouraging them or ministering to their needs.<br>
Whatever happens, it is essential that the group be contained and move<br>
forward as a group.<br>
It is important that all equipment taken on a travel campout be of good<br>
quality. Repairs along the way often make the poor quality article worse.<br>
Sometimes something can be rendered irreparable on the first day and<br>
you are then stuck without<br>
