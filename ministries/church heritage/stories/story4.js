<h2>The Second Angel’s Message</h2>

<blockquote>
    “And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she 
    made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication” — <em>Revelation 14:8</em>
</blockquote>

<p>The message of the second angel, which is joined with that of the first angel, may at first glance seem unrelated. However, in this section, we shall see how the two messages were connected. The first and second angels’ messages were given at the right time, when the hearts of the people were ready to accept them. The work that God planned to accomplish through these two messages was effectively done.</p>

<h3>The Proclamation of the Second Angel’s Message</h3>

<p>The second angel’s message was proclaimed mainly during the <strong>“tarrying time”</strong> between <strong>March and October, 1844</strong>.</p>

<h3>William Miller and the Advent Message</h3>

<p><strong>William Miller</strong> began his public ministry in <strong>1831</strong>, and many voices were heard in other parts of the world announcing the coming of Christ. However, the focal point of Advent teaching was in <strong>New England</strong>, the northeastern corner of the United States.</p>

<p>For several years, William Miller worked almost single-handedly. By <strong>1839 and 1840</strong>, men of influence and ability — both writers and preachers — began to accept his teaching and joined Miller in his devoted evangelism.</p>

<h2>The Advent Bible Conferences</h2>

<p>From 1840 to 1842, a series of general conferences of Advent believers was held in various cities of New England. William Miller, though unable to attend previous meetings, finally participated in one held in his hometown. There, he met with earnest, scholarly, and skillful men who had joined the movement — some through his teachings, others through independent study.</p>

<h3>Unity and Preaching</h3>

<p>About <strong>200 leaders</strong> attended these conferences, which helped unify their thinking and stimulate their preaching. Many were ministers of Protestant churches, representing most of the popular denominations. They preached the <strong>first angel’s message</strong> in:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Their own pulpits</li>
    <li>Other churches</li>
    <li>Public meetings</li>
    <li>Camp meetings</li>
</ul>

<p>There were many Advent papers published, but the closest thing to an official organ of the movement was the <em>Signs of the Times</em>. The leaders formed the <strong>Adventist Association</strong> without abandoning their loyalty to their own congregations or denominations.</p>

<h3>Common Doctrines Taught</h3>

<p>The following doctrines were discussed at the conferences and then taught to the people:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The nature of Christ’s coming in the clouds of heaven</li>
    <li>The signs of His coming, including the Dark Day, the meteoric shower, and social unrest</li>
    <li>The prophecies in <em>Revelation</em>, ending with the three woes and their confirmation in the loss of the Ottoman Empire’s independence in 1840</li>
    <li>The 1260 years of papal domination, ending with the pope’s captivity in 1798</li>
    <li>Other related time prophecies</li>
    <li>The 2300 years of <em>Daniel 8:14</em></li>
    <li>The “premillennial” interpretation of Christ’s coming, expected in "about 1843"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reactions and Separation</h3>

<p>Despite some opposition — especially to the preaching of the premillennial return of Christ — the Millerites persisted. They maintained friendly relations with various denominations, converting many infidels, and even boosting Bible sales.</p>

<h4>Charles Fitch's Influence</h4>

<p>In the summer of 1843, Charles Fitch printed a sermon applying <em>Revelation 14:8</em> and <em>18:2-4</em> to both the Protestant churches and Roman Catholicism. He declared that both branches of Christendom had become <strong>Babylon</strong> and had fallen by rejecting the message of Christ’s second coming.</p>

<p>This interpretation gained traction as more churches began barring Advent preaching and preachers. That same summer, Millerite ministers were ordained to preach the Second Advent, and the <em>Signs of the Times</em> advised believers to separate from their congregations.</p>

<h4>The Harmon Family's Story</h4>

<p>Members were often pressured by their church officers to renounce premillennialism or leave. An example is the <strong>Harmon family</strong>. Ellen White recounts their experience in <em>Life Sketches</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
    “The next Sunday, at the commencement of the love feast, the presiding elder read off our names, seven in number, as discontinued from the church.” — <em>Life Sketches</em>, pages 50-53
</blockquote>

<h3>The Second Angel’s Message</h3>

<p>When some Advent preachers applied the term <strong>"Babylon"</strong> directly to churches rejecting the doctrine of judgment and Jesus' return, the <strong>second angel’s message</strong> joined the first. A paper titled <em>“Babylon the Great Is Fallen”</em> was published in Oswego, New York.</p>

<p>By the summer of 1844, at least <strong>50,000 believers</strong> had separated from their churches to form their own groups.</p>

<h2>The Midnight Cry</h2>
            
<p>William Miller and others attempted to find a definite time for the end of the <strong>2300-day prophecy</strong>. At first, they declared that it would be “about 1843.” Later, the limit of time was set at:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>March 21</strong></li>
    <li><strong>April 18, 1844</strong> — the end of the Jewish year 1843</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the time passed without any unusual happening. This <strong>first disappointment</strong> was a heavy blow to the believers and was followed by a period of quietness, later interpreted as the <em>“tarrying time”</em> from the parable of the ten virgins.</p>

<h3>Re-examining the Prophecy</h3>

<p>After this disappointment, scholars returned to their books and discovered their error — the 2300 years would include the complete years of <strong>457 B.C.</strong> and <strong>A.D. 1843</strong>. This meant that a happening within the year 457 B.C. would correspond to the same date in 1844.</p>

<p>Although this had been pointed out a year before, it was not generally accepted at the time. In the summer of 1844, a new burst of light illuminated the Advent movement, leading to its dramatic climax in <strong>October 1844</strong>.</p>

<h3>Joseph Bates and the Midnight Cry</h3>

<p>At a camp meeting in New Hampshire in August, <strong>Joseph Bates</strong> anticipated receiving new light. He invited <strong>Samuel S. Snow</strong> to present his study on <em>“The Midnight Cry.”</em></p>

<p>Brother Snow not only spoke on that day but continued to speak each day until the meetings concluded. The people were thrilled, believing that the parable of the ten virgins applied directly to them.</p>

<h3>The Fall of 1844 and October 22</h3>

<p>Samuel Snow explained that the Advent believers had expected the Lord to come in the spring of 1844 but realized the <strong>2300-day prophecy</strong> could not end until the <strong>fall of 1844</strong>. A closer study of the sanctuary and its services revealed that the <strong>cleansing of the sanctuary</strong> occurred on the tenth day of the seventh month.</p>

<p>This matched the idea that the prophecy would end in the fall, with the tenth day of the seventh month in 1844 falling on <strong>October 22</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Midnight Cry and the Tarrying Time</h3>

<p>In the parable of the ten virgins, the cry was made at midnight. <strong>Samuel Snow’s midsummer message</strong> was seen as corresponding to the <em>“midnight cry.”</em> The truth of this message gripped the hearts of the people, and they left the camp meeting to spread the word far and wide:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.”
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>“Midnight Cry”</em> was proclaimed during the <em>“tarrying time.”</em> The <strong>50,000 Advent believers</strong> were so convinced that the Lord would come that many of them stopped cultivating their fields, believing Jesus would return before another harvest. Instead, they devoted their time to proclaiming His coming.</p>

<h2>The Great Disappointment</h2>

<p>As October 22, 1844, drew near, tension increased among the Adventists. There were thousands who were completely unconcerned or who were watching merely as bystanders. Newspapers had published sensational stories about the Millerites. However, the sober factual reports described the Adventist groups as sincere, devout people who were calm and earnest.</p>

<h3>Different Groups Among the Advent Believers</h3>

<p>There were several classes of people among the Advent believers:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some joined the group through fear.</li>
    <li>Some rejected the exact date — including William Miller himself — until a few weeks before October 22.</li>
    <li>The honest believers — the majority — who accepted the day and made consistent preparation to meet Jesus.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Day of the Disappointment</h3>

<p>The day arrived. The Adventists gathered in meeting houses or private homes, singing hymns and reviewing evidence that the Lord would come. As the day passed and the sun set, there was still hope:</p>

<blockquote>
    “For ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning.” — <em>Mark 13:35</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, midnight passed. Prayers were offered, and tears filled the eyes of some believers. They were grief-stricken and asked one another:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Have the Scriptures failed?”
</blockquote>

<p>Further diligent study would reveal that the time prophecy was correct, but the event to take place had been incorrectly interpreted.</p>

<h3>Hiram Edson's Vision</h3>

<p>Hiram Edson encouraged the believers:</p>

<blockquote>
    “There is a God in heaven. He has made Himself known to us in blessing, in forgiving, in redeeming, and He will not fail us now. Sometime soon this mystery will be solved.”
</blockquote>

<p>Many Millerites drifted away soon after the disappointment, though a substantial group held together for several years. Miller died in December 1849. Some of his associates continued to set new dates for several years, forming different groups:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Evangelical Adventists</strong>: Believed in consciousness in death and an eternally burning hell, gradually declining into extinction.</li>
    <li><strong>Advent Christians</strong>: Believed in the unconscious state of the dead but continued to observe Sunday. Their church still exists.</li>
    <li>Other smaller groups, some of whom fell into fanaticism.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Nucleus of the Remnant Church</h3>

<p>We are primarily interested in the group including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Hiram Edson</li>
    <li>Joseph Bates</li>
    <li>James White</li>
    <li>Ellen Harmon (who married James White on August 30, 1846)</li>
</ul>

<p>This group would form the nucleus of the remnant church.</p>

<h3>The Cornfield Experience</h3>

<p>On the morning of October 23, most believers gathered at Edson’s farmhouse went sorrowfully home. Edson and some close friends went to the barn for a season of prayer, which gave them confidence that the Lord would show them the way.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Edson said to one of the believers:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Let us go out to comfort the brethren with this assurance.”
</blockquote>

<p>As they walked through Edson’s cornfield, meditating on the disappointment, something happened. Edson stopped suddenly. He later wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
    “I saw distinctly and clearly that instead of our High Priest coming out of the Most Holy of the heavenly sanctuary to come to this earth on the tenth day of the seventh month, at the end of the 2300 days, He for the first time entered on that day the second apartment of that sanctuary and that He had a work to perform in the Most Holy before coming to this earth.”
</blockquote>

<p>This moment marked the beginning of the doctrine of the <strong>investigative judgment</strong>.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Revelation</h3>

<p>Edson’s companion, who had walked ahead, called back to him:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Brother Edson, what are you stopping for?”
</blockquote>

<p>Edson replied:</p>

<blockquote>
    “The Lord was answering our morning prayer.”
</blockquote>

<p>He shared his new insight, and this experience led the group to study the sanctuary service given to Israel and the significance of the 2300 days doctrine. Their findings were published in Advent journals, and Edson called a conference late in 1845.</p>

<h3>A Resolved Mystery</h3>

<p>With the dates confirmed and the misunderstanding clarified, the message of the first angel continued as <strong>present truth</strong>. It was and remains a powerful doctrine, calling sinners to Christ in this time of judgment. The message of the second angel, relevant during the period preceding the disappointment, also holds significance for the future.</p>

<h2>The Third Angel Begins</h2>

<p>The study of the sanctuary was the key that unlocked the mystery of the disappointment. It was also 
a key to the central doctrine of the <em>Third Angel’s Message</em>, which points especially to the law of 
God and particularly to the consequences of transgressions. There is a definite link between this 
message and the Sabbath, which is the center of the law. It was in the light given to the early 
believers on the Sabbath truth that God was preparing for the final message.</p>

<h3>The Sabbath Truth and Early Adventists</h3>

<p>During the time of the <strong>Midnight Cry in 1844</strong>, Mrs. Rachel Oakes (later Preston), a Seventh Day 
Baptist, came to Washington, New Hampshire, to visit her daughter, who was one of the Advent 
believers. Mrs. Oakes was an ardent believer in the Bible Sabbath and had brought with her a 
supply of tracts. Soon she accepted the Advent doctrines, and she also continued to keep the Sabbath. The tracts she quietly distributed bore fruit.</p>

<blockquote>
    At a Sunday morning service, one of the Adventist believers arose and said he was convinced the seventh day was the true Bible Sabbath, and that he, for one, was resolved to keep it.
</blockquote>

<p>Several others expressed themselves as like-minded, and within a few days, practically the entire company of forty became Sabbathkeepers.</p>

<h3>The First Seventh-day Adventist Church</h3>

<p>Thus began, in a sense, at Washington, New Hampshire, the first Seventh-day Adventist church, 
although it was years before the Seventh-day Adventist organization was officially established.</p>

<p>The first Adventist minister to accept the Sabbath was <strong>Frederick Wheeler</strong>, of the Washington group. 
He was formerly a Methodist minister and an associate of William Miller.</p>

<h3>Spreading the Sabbath Message</h3>

<p>Adventists as a body were called to the Sabbath question through an essay by <strong>T. M. Preble</strong>, published in a paper at Portland, Maine, in early 1845. Shortly afterward, <strong>J. B. Cook</strong> also wrote an article that:</p>

<blockquote>
    Showed conclusively that there is no Scriptural evidence for keeping Sunday as the seventh-day Sabbath.
</blockquote>

<p>A Sabbath movement had begun that could not easily be stopped.</p>

<h3>Joseph Bates and the Sabbath</h3>

<p>Hearing of the Washington, New Hampshire, company that was keeping the Sabbath, <strong>Joseph Bates</strong> decided to visit them to learn more. He went to New Hampshire, studied the subject, saw their views were correct, and accepted the light. Returning home, he met <strong>Mr. Hall</strong> on the bridge between New Bedford and Fairhaven, and their conversation went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Mr. Hall:</strong> "Captain Bates, what’s the news?"  
    <br>
    <strong>Joseph Bates:</strong> "The news is that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord our God."  
    <br>
    <strong>Mr. Hall:</strong> "Well, I shall go home and read my Bible and see about that."
</blockquote>

<p>After studying his Bible, Mr. Hall accepted the Sabbath truth and began obeying it.</p>

<h3>A Long-standing Truth</h3>

<p>Although the seventh-day Sabbath truth was highlighted again in 1844, there have been Sabbathkeepers since the beginning of time. Even during the Dark Ages, certain groups observed the seventh-day Sabbath. The <strong>Seventh Day Baptists</strong> faithfully preserved the truth of the fourth commandment for centuries, and it was from them that the Adventists first learned of the Sabbath truth.</p>

<h2>The Sabbath Conferences</h2>

<p>The doctrine of the <strong>seventh-day Sabbath</strong> soon became a test for those wishing to join the Sabbathkeeping Adventists. The reading of a single article was enough to convince <strong>Joseph Bates</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Hiram Edson</strong> also readily accepted the Sabbath truth. <strong>Frederick Wheeler</strong> and <strong>William Farnsworth</strong> needed only an introduction to the subject and a little time to study; soon, they became Sabbathkeepers.</p>

<p><strong>James and Ellen White</strong> were not initially impressed by the importance of the Sabbath doctrine. However, after their marriage, they studied a pamphlet published by Bates, and they soon accepted the Sabbath.</p>

<h3>The Quest for Unity</h3>

<p>These were challenging days for the early leaders, as there was not yet a unity of teaching among them. In God’s providence, several conferences were held during this time. The believers dug deeply into the Scriptures, comparing text with text until they gained a clear understanding of the Bible's doctrines.</p>

<h3>The 1848 Bible Conferences</h3>

<p>In total, there were <strong>six Bible conferences</strong> in <strong>1848</strong>. <strong>Ellen White</strong> played a crucial role in these conferences, offering guidance and support as the believers worked to establish a foundation of unified teachings.</p>

<h2>God’s Gift to the Remnant Church [I]</h2>

<p>“While in vision on Patmos, the apostle John saw symbols of great eras of world history. As John peered into the future, he caught a glimpse of God’s loyal people near the close of time, and he saw the intensity of the conflict. As the prophet looked closely, he observed that this church was keeping God’s commandments. He saw, too, that it had special divine guidance through the Spirit of Prophecy,</p>

<blockquote>
    ‘for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy’ — <em>Revelation 19:10</em>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Story of Our Church, p. 186</strong></p>

<h3>God's Communication with His Church</h3>

<p>From the very beginning, God has in various ways kept in contact with His church. His leadership is not always as obvious as the pillar of cloud by day or pillar of fire by night, but His people are made aware of His presence. The main channel of communication between God and His people has always been through <strong>“His servants the prophets.”</strong></p>

<p>As predicted in <strong>Revelation 12:17</strong> and <strong>19:10</strong>, the remnant church was to have the gift of prophecy.</p>

<h3>William Ellis Foy</h3>

<p>William Ellis Foy was born in <strong>1818</strong> to Joseph and Elizabeth Foy in Augusta, Maine, a free state. Consequently, William was born <em>“free”</em> and grew up during a time of racial conflict and divide. Though Maine had very few Blacks and virtually no slaves, it was not without racial prejudice.</p>

<p>After growing up in a rural setting for much of his life, Foy married in the mid-to-late <strong>1830s</strong> and moved to Boston. There, he used his farming and carpentry skills to earn a living.</p>

<h4>Conversion and Visions</h4>

<p>In <strong>1835</strong>, Foy was converted under the preaching of Elder Silas Curtis at the Freewill Baptist Church in Augusta, Maine. He accepted Christianity and sought to understand how to be saved. Shortly after, Foy began receiving visions about the Advent. Many witnessed him in these visions after his move to Boston.</p>

<p>His first vision was about the <strong>ultimate victory of the saints</strong>. His second vision, lasting <strong>12½ hours</strong> from Friday night into early Saturday morning, focused on the <strong>judgment and the preparedness of the church</strong>. Despite racial tensions, Foy trusted God and shared his visions.</p>

<p>Foy received <strong>two more visions</strong> just before the disappointment. He saw three platforms, representing a third phase of God's message. Confused, he ceased public work but retained his interest in the Advent movement until his death on <strong>November 9, 1893</strong>, at age 75.</p>

<h3>Hazen Foss</h3>
<p>Hazen Foss, a talented young Adventist from Poland, Maine, received a vision a few weeks before the great disappointment. Like Foy, he saw the three platforms. Foss was warned about the difficulties he would face as a messenger of the Lord. However, due to fear of ridicule, he refused to share the vision.</p>

<p>The vision was repeated with a warning: if he refused again, the gift would be withdrawn. Still, he declined, and a third vision revealed that the gift was being given to <strong>“one of the weakest of the weak.”</strong> Though Foss lived until <strong>1893</strong>, he never regained an interest in personal religion.</p>

<p>This is the last subpart of this part.</p>
            
<h3>Ellen Harmon</h3>

<p>Ellen Harmon was the third person chosen by the Lord to be His messenger to the remnant. In <strong>December 1844</strong>, two months after the disappointment, God gave Ellen, a 17-year-old girl, a vision. This symbolic vision portrayed the future of the church from <strong>October 22</strong> until the saints’ entrance into the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The vision revealed that the coming of Jesus was not as near as they had hoped. The glory of heaven was so vivid to Ellen that when she awoke, everything around her seemed dark. She wept, longing for heaven.</p>

<p>About a week later, Ellen received a second vision. She was instructed to travel and share the divine messages, though warned about the trials she would face.</p>

<h4>A Shared Vision</h4>

<p>In her first vision, Ellen Harmon saw the same portrayal shown to Foss and Foy — the journey of God’s people toward the kingdom.</p>

<h3>Testing Ellen Harmon’s Message</h3>

<p>In the early Advent church, members had to decide whether Ellen Harmon’s messages were from God. Today, those joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church must also determine whether her claims are truthful. The Bible provides <strong>four tests</strong> to verify a prophet:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Accord with Scripture</strong> — “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” — <em>Isaiah 8:20</em><br>
        Ellen White's teachings align with the Bible, consistently magnifying Scripture.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fruit of Their Work</strong> — “By their fruits ye shall know them.” — <em>Matthew 7:20</em><br>
        The Sabbath School, Christian education, healthful living, and publishing work resulted from Ellen White's guidance. Over 70 years, she lived a life devoted to God’s work, seeking neither office nor wealth.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fulfilled Prophecies</strong> — “When the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known.” — <em>Jeremiah 28:9</em><br>
        Ellen White predicted the global expansion of the publishing work — starting with a few papers in a carpetbag — which now spans the world. She also foresaw modern developments like the spread of cancer and international warfare, confirming her prophetic role.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Confession of Jesus</strong> — “Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God.” — <em>1 John 4:2</em><br>
        Ellen White’s books, including <em>The Desire of Ages</em> and <em>Christ’s Object Lessons</em>, affirm Jesus’ divinity and mission.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Enduring Legacy</h3>
<p>Despite facing fierce opposition, Ellen White’s over <strong>60 published volumes</strong> and countless magazine articles stand as a testament to her divine commission. The Seventh-day Adventist Church’s history is deeply tied to God’s guidance through the gift of prophecy. Wherever the church followed God’s counsel, it prospered.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts About the Life and Service of Ellen White [I]</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Birth and Early Life:</strong> Ellen Gould Harmon was born on <strong>November 26, 1827</strong>, on a farm at Gorham, Maine, about twelve miles west of Portland. She had a twin sister and was the youngest of a family of eight. She was a normal, happy child with a pleasant disposition and a deep sense of the importance of religion, instilled by her devout parents.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>A Life-Changing Injury:</strong> A turning point in her life came when, as she was crossing a park, she was struck in the face by a stone thrown by another girl. Her nose was broken, her face temporarily disfigured, and she remained unconscious for three weeks. The shock left her an invalid for some time. Despite efforts to return to school, her health forced her to abandon academic education.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Spiritual Awakening:</strong> In <strong>1840</strong> and again in <strong>1842</strong>, Ellen and her family listened to William Miller's preaching about the imminent advent of Christ. They accepted his teachings while remaining Methodists. This period was spiritually challenging for Ellen, but at a camp meeting in late 1840, she gave her heart to God and found peace, beginning a new relationship with the Lord.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>The Great Disappointment:</strong> Her family embraced the "midnight cry" to leave apostate churches and joined those who experienced the "Great Disappointment" of 1844. Despite the heartbreak, they remained steadfast in their belief in the Advent message.</p>

        <p><strong>Her First Vision:</strong> Shortly after the Great Disappointment, Ellen received her first vision, revealing the progress of God’s people toward their heavenly home. Overwhelmed by her youth (she was just seventeen), poor health, and the responsibility of being God’s messenger, she prayed to be released from the task. Nevertheless, she accepted God’s call.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>The Sabbath Vision:</strong> In <strong>April 1847</strong>, Ellen was given a vision of the Sabbath. She saw the temple in heaven with Jesus lifting the lid of the ark, revealing the <strong>Ten Commandments</strong>. A soft halo of light surrounded the fourth commandment, and an angel affirmed its significance. She was shown that had the Sabbath always been kept, there would have been no infidels or idolaters. This vision clarified the Sabbath’s relationship to the third angel’s message, and those who embraced these teachings laid the foundation for the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p>

        <p><strong>A Lifelong Ministry:</strong> For the next seventy years, Ellen White shared God’s counsel with His people. She addressed many audiences, authored around forty books (known as the "Spirit of Prophecy"), and wrote numerous articles for Seventh-day Adventist publications. Her most famous book, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, tells the story of Christ’s life. She traveled extensively, including to Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, helping to establish the church's work, including founding Avondale College in Australia.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Divine Visions:</strong> Ellen received God's messages primarily through visions. Eyewitnesses, including medical professionals, described how she would stop breathing during visions, yet her face remained natural in color, and her pulse continued. F.C. Castle, who witnessed a medical examination during one of her visions, stated:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "A lighted candle was held close to her eyes, which were wide open, and not a muscle of the eye moved. She was then examined with regard to her pulse and her breathing, and there was no respiration. The result was that all were satisfied they would not be accountable for unnatural scientific principles."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Despite her frailty, she displayed great strength during visions—once holding an eighteen-pound Bible in her extended left hand for half an hour.</p>

<h2>Other Early Pioneers</h2>

<p>Apart from the pioneers mentioned previously, we also have the following pioneers.</p>
            
<h3>James White (1821-1881)</h3>
<p>James White was a pioneer minister in the Advent movement. In spite of physical defects, he felt that God wanted him to warn the world of its nearing end and went on a preaching tour carrying the first angel’s message to many towns. He was a persuasive speaker and a good singer, but above all, he was a leader of men. As Spalding wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
    “James White, intrepid, resourceful, far-seeing, eager leader of the infant Seventh-day Adventist Church, who in the early decades of its history had a chief part: first, in framing the doctrines and bringing out a people to stand upon them; second, in promoting and organizing the ecclesiastical polity; and third, in founding and managing the institutions– corporate church, publishing, health and educational– which make up the pillars of this cause. He was a born leader...All his co-workers felt the dynamic power of his spirit.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>James White served as president of the General Conference for three terms, totaling ten years.</strong></p>

<h3>Joseph Bates (1792-1872)</h3>
<p>Joseph Bates had risen from cabin boy to captain and had retired from the sea before the first angel’s message came to him. God had been leading him; always a man of good principles and a lover of right and truth, he had given up the use of alcohol and tobacco while sailing the seas. He was a member of the Christian Church and about fifty years of age when he was called to preach. He organized one of the first temperance societies in America. He poured his money into the work until, at the time of the great disappointment, he had little left; after that, he lived much by faith.</p>
<p>He was the first of leaders who later became Seventh-day Adventist ministers to accept the Sabbath truth and introduce it to other leading workers and believers. He also wrote the first comprehensive Sabbath tract that was printed. He spent much of his time traveling the “unworked West,” even in the winter snows of Canada and in all parts of eastern America. “He shrank from no hardship in his untiring zeal.”</p>
<p>He was older in years than his more youthful associates, the Whites, and they leaned upon his fatherly advice in the pioneering days of the movement. He was active until the end of his life; he died in 1872 and is buried near his home in Michigan.</p>

<h2>Other Early Pioneers [II]</h2>
<p>Continuation...</p>
            
<h3>John Nevins Andrews (1829-1883)</h3>
<p>John Nevins Andrews was but fifteen years old when he shared in the great disappointment. He began to preach at 21. He was among the first of the leaders to accept the Sabbath truth, was a diligent student, an able writer (History of the Sabbath), and a good organizer. He led out in studying God’s plan for gospel finance, from which was developed the tithing system as we know it today.</p>
<p>In August, 1860, he suggested publicly that the brethren should meet to discuss church organization; as a result, the Advent Review Publishing Association was formed, and the name “Seventh-day Adventist” was chosen for the church. Partly because he was a good linguist, he was sent to Europe in 1874 as our first official overseas missionary, and he laid a firm foundation for the work there.</p>
<p><strong>J. N. Andrews was the third president of the General Conference.</strong></p>

<h3>John Norton Loughborough (1832-1924)</h3>
<p>John Norton Loughborough preached for the Adventists from the age of sixteen, though he had not heard the Sabbath truth until 1852, when J. N. Andrews explained it so clearly that he accepted it immediately. He worked with M. E. Cornell in the 1850's before ministers received salaries, laboring at any work he could find for four half-days a week, and preaching the rest of the time.</p>

<h3>John Byington (1798-1887)</h3>
<p>John Byington is best remembered as the first president of the General Conference. He had been a Methodist minister before the three angels’ messages came to him. One of the first Sabbath schools and the first Adventist elementary school (begun in 1853) were taught in Byington’s home at Buck’s Bridge, New York. The teacher was his daughter Martha. Early Sabbathkeepers gathered at his property, on which he built an Adventist church.</p>

<h3>J. H. Waggoner (1820-1889)</h3>
<p>J. H. Waggoner accepted the Advent message in 1852 and is listed among those who called for a discussion of church organization in 1860; by then he was one of the leaders among Sabbathkeeping Adventists. He worked in the West, chiefly as the editor of the <em>Signs of the Times</em>. Later he served in Europe and died in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Continuation...</p>
            
<h3>Uriah (1832-1903) and Annie (1828-1855) Smith</h3>
<p>Uriah and Annie Smith were two promising young people, brother and sister, who were teaching when the Lord called them to work for Him. Annie Smith responded as a result of a dream about Elder Joseph Bates, whom she heard speak very soon after. She was an ardent worker, best remembered for her poems, many of which were used as hymns. Her life ended prematurely in 1855 as a result of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Uriah Smith accepted the message about the end of 1852, more than a year after his sister, and entered the publishing work. He was an ordained minister of the gospel and spent most of his life as an editor, from 1853 to 1903, the year of his death. He was an editor of the <em>Review and Herald</em> and author. <em>Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation</em> is the work by which he is best remembered. In 1888 he was a leader in the discussions on righteousness by faith, and he was one of the prominent Bible scholars of the denomination.</p>

<h3>Frederick Wheeler (1811-1910)</h3>
<p>Frederick Wheeler was a Methodist-Adventist preacher who lived in New Hampshire and pastored the church at Washington. He was essentially the first Seventh-day Adventist minister, for he accepted the Sabbath truth brought to him by Mrs. Rachel Oakes in 1844. Among those in his congregation who accepted the third angel’s message were the Farnsworth brothers, William and Cyrus.</p>
