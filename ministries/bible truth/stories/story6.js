  <h2>Lesson 22 - The Return of Christ</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Promise of the Second Coming</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus promised His disciples that He would come again to take them with Him:
    <strong>John 14:1-3</strong> – “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 
    In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. 
    I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, 
    I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”
  </p>
  <p>
    At Christ’s ascension, angels confirmed this promise:
    <strong>Acts 1:9-11</strong> – “This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, 
    shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ confirmed His promise again decades later:
    <strong>Revelation 22:20</strong> – “Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The Second Coming is a major theme in the Bible, especially the New Testament, with approximately 318 references across its 260 chapters. Even Old Testament saints anticipated His return.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Manner of Christ’s Return</h3>
  <p>
    Jesus warned us not to be deceived by false claims of His return:
    <strong>Matthew 24:23-26</strong> – “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not...”
  </p>
  <p>
    He clarified the unmistakable nature of His return:
    <strong>Matthew 24:27</strong> – “For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Matthew 24:30-31</strong> – “Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven... and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ will come visibly and personally:
    <strong>Acts 1:9-11</strong> – “...shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Revelation 1:7</strong> – “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him...”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Matthew 26:64</strong> – Jesus told His accusers, “...ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Daniel 12:2</strong> – “...some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ will return in glory, accompanied by angels:
    <strong>Matthew 25:31</strong> – “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him...”
    <br>
    <strong>Matthew 16:27</strong> – “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels...”
    <br>
    <strong>Luke 9:26</strong> – “...when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.”

Lesson 22 – The Return of Christ

1. The Promise of the Second Coming
Jesus promised His disciples that He would return to take them with Him. In John 14:1-3, He told them not to be troubled, encouraging them to believe in God and also in Him. He spoke of His Father’s house, where there are many mansions, and assured them that He was going to prepare a place for them. He promised that if He went to prepare a place, He would come again and receive them, so that they would be where He is.
This promise was confirmed during His ascension. In Acts 1:9-11, two angels assured the disciples that Jesus, who had been taken into heaven, would return in the same way they saw Him go.
Later, in Revelation 22:20, Jesus reaffirmed His promise, saying, “Surely I come quickly,” to which the faithful respond, “Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”
The Second Coming is not a minor theme. It is a major message of the Bible, particularly the New Testament. There are about 318 references to it in the 260 chapters of the New Testament. Even the saints of the Old Testament looked forward to His return.

2. The Manner of Christ’s Return
Jesus warned that we should not be misled by false reports of His return. In Matthew 24:23-26, He cautioned against believing anyone who says, “Here is Christ,” or “There He is.”
He made it clear that His return would be unmistakable. In Matthew 24:27, He compared it to lightning that shines from the east to the west. It will be sudden and visible to all.
Matthew 24:30-31 speaks of the sign of the Son of Man appearing in the sky, followed by the sound of a trumpet and angels gathering His people.
Acts 1:11 also confirms that Jesus will return in the same visible and personal way in which He left. Revelation 1:7 says that every eye will see Him. In Matthew 26:64, Jesus told His accusers they would see Him coming in the clouds of heaven.
Daniel 12:2 says that at His return, some will rise to everlasting life and others to shame and everlasting contempt.
Jesus will return in glory, accompanied by angels. In Matthew 25:31, we’re told He will come in His glory with all the holy angels. Matthew 16:27 and Luke 9:26 echo the same, saying He will come in the glory of His Father and with His holy angels.

3. Events Connected with the Second Advent
When Christ returns, certain key events will unfold.
First, the righteous dead will be raised. In 1 Thessalonians 4:16, we are told that the dead in Christ will rise first. 1 Corinthians 15:22-23 explains that as all die in Adam, so in Christ, all will be made alive.
Next, the righteous living will be changed and caught up. 1 Thessalonians 4:17 says that those who are alive and remain will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. 1 Corinthians 15:51-53 states that we shall all be changed, and that mortality must put on immortality. Matthew 24:31 tells us that angels will gather His elect from all over.
The wicked will be destroyed. Luke 17:26-30 compares it to the day Lot left Sodom and fire and brimstone fell—so shall it be at Christ’s return. In 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10, we read that He will take vengeance on those who do not know God. Revelation 6:14-17 describes people hiding in fear, asking who can stand before His wrath. 2 Thessalonians 2:8 adds that the Lord will consume the lawless one with the breath of His mouth.
Finally, the earth itself will suffer devastation. Revelation 16 describes seven last plagues. Isaiah 24 says the earth will mourn, fade, and be burned, and that its inhabitants will be judged.

4. Warnings and Admonitions in View of the Second Advent
Because Christ’s return will be sudden, we are called to be ready. Matthew 24:44 urges us to be prepared, for the Son of Man will come at an unexpected hour.
In Mark 13:32-37, Jesus tells us to stay alert and watchful, as we do not know when the Master of the house will return.
1 Thessalonians 5:1-6 encourages believers not to sleep like others but to be watchful and sober.
Finally, 1 Thessalonians 5:23 offers a prayer: that the very God of peace would sanctify us completely in preparation for His return.

Lesson 23 - Signs of Christ’s Return

Let us explore the important topic of the signs of Christ’s return.

1. The Nearness of Christ’s Return
The disciples once asked Jesus, “What shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” as recorded in Matthew 24, verse 3. In response, Jesus described many signs and concluded with the parable of the fig tree, saying, “When ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.” However, He also clearly stated, “Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.” (Matthew 24:36).

2. Signs in the National World
Jesus spoke of great turmoil among nations. He said, “Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars... Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.” This was recorded in Matthew 24, verses 6 to 7.

3. Signs in the Social World
As iniquity increases, Jesus warned that “the love of many shall wax cold.” Paul also cautioned that in the last days, perilous times would come. People would be lovers of themselves, having a form of godliness, but denying its power. This warning is found in 2 Timothy chapter 3, verses 1 to 5.

4. Signs in the Religious World
Several religious signs will mark the last days. First, there will be a form of godliness without power, as seen in 2 Timothy 3:5. Many false prophets will arise and deceive many, according to Matthew 24:11. False Christs will also appear, and Jesus warned us not to believe such claims, as stated in Matthew 24, verses 23 and 26. Some people will depart from the faith and follow seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 4:1. Revelation 13:8 warns that many will worship the beast—those whose names are not written in the Book of Life. Persecution will also increase. Matthew 24:9 says, “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted... and shall hate you.” However, amidst this, the gospel will go forth. Jesus declared, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14, Revelation 14:6-7). Finally, scoffers will rise in the last days, questioning, “Where is the promise of His coming?” as seen in 2 Peter 3:3-4.

5. Signs in the Physical World
Jesus also foretold signs in nature: “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened... and the stars shall fall from heaven.” (Matthew 24:29). This great tribulation refers to a prophetic period of 1260 years, interpreted from texts such as Revelation 12:6 and Ezekiel 4:6, historically spanning from 538 A.D. to 1798 A.D., a time known for papal persecution. Significant physical signs occurred during and after this period. The great earthquake mentioned in Revelation 6:12 is believed to be the Lisbon earthquake of November 1, 1755. The dark day, also in Revelation 6:12, refers to May 19, 1780, when the sun was darkened. The falling stars, referenced in Revelation 6:13, were observed on November 13, 1833.

6. Other Signs of the Last Days
Luke 21:25 tells us, “Upon the earth, there shall be distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring.” Matthew 24:7 adds, “There shall be famines, and pestilences.” These are signs of increasing global unrest and natural disasters.

7. The Need for Preparation
Jesus concluded with a strong warning. In Matthew 24:43, He said, “If the goodman of the house had known... he would have watched.” And in the parable of the ten virgins, He taught the vital lesson: “Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour.” (Matthew 25:13).

  <h2>Lesson 24 - The Millennium</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Meaning of the Word</h3>
  <p>
    The term <strong>"millennium"</strong> is not explicitly found in Scripture, but it derives from Latin: <em>"mille"</em> meaning "a thousand" and <em>"annus"</em> meaning "year." 
    It refers to the 1,000-year period mentioned in <strong>Revelation 20</strong>. 
    <blockquote>“And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” (Revelation 20:4)</blockquote>
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Righteous During the Millennium</h3>
  <p>
    The righteous will live and reign with Christ during the millennium.
    <blockquote>“And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them… and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” (Revelation 20:4)</blockquote>
    Jesus promised to return and take His people to be with Him:
    <blockquote>“Let not your heart be troubled… I will come again and receive you unto myself.” (John 14:1–3)</blockquote>
    At Christ's second coming:
    <blockquote>“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout… and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16)</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up… to meet the Lord in the air.” (1 Thessalonians 4:17)</blockquote>
    These verses show that the righteous will be taken to be with Christ after His return and will reign with Him in heaven during the millennium:
    <blockquote>“They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” (Revelation 20:6)</blockquote>
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Unrighteous During the Millennium</h3>
  <p>
    The wicked dead remain in their graves during the millennium.
    <blockquote>“But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” (Revelation 20:5)</blockquote>
    Only the righteous are raised at Christ's coming:
    <blockquote>“Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection.” (Revelation 20:6)</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“They that are Christ’s at his coming.” (1 Corinthians 15:23)</blockquote>
    The wicked who are alive at Christ’s return will be slain:
    <blockquote>“And then shall that Wicked be revealed… whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth.” (2 Thessalonians 2:8)</blockquote>
  </p>

  <h3>4. Satan During the Millennium</h3>
  <p>
    Satan is bound during the millennium:
    <blockquote>“And he laid hold on the dragon… and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit.” (Revelation 20:2–3)</blockquote>
    The “bottomless pit” symbolizes a desolate earth, as described in:
    <blockquote>“I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void… the heavens had no light… all the cities thereof were broken down.” (Jeremiah 4:23–27)</blockquote>
    Also, the plagues preceding Christ's return leave the earth in ruin:
    <blockquote>“And there was a great earthquake… every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.” (Revelation 16:18–20)</blockquote>
    Ezekiel’s prophecy describes Satan’s punishment:
    <blockquote>“I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.” (Ezekiel 28:18)</blockquote>
  </p>

  <h3>5. Events at the Close of the Millennium</h3>
  <p>
    At the end of the 1,000 years, the wicked are resurrected:
    <blockquote>“But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” (Revelation 20:5)</blockquote>
    Jesus foretold two resurrections:
    <blockquote>“All that are in the graves shall hear his voice… they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” (John 5:28–29)</blockquote>
    Satan is released to deceive once more:
    <blockquote>“And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.” (Revelation 20:7)</blockquote>
    He gathers the wicked for a final attack:
    <blockquote>“And shall go out to deceive the nations… to gather them together to battle.” (Revelation 20:8)</blockquote>
    But God intervenes:
    <blockquote>“And they went up on the breadth of the earth… and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.” (Revelation 20:9)</blockquote>
    This happens as the New Jerusalem descends:
    <blockquote>“And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven.” (Revelation 21:2)</blockquote>
    Then comes the final judgment:
    <blockquote>“And I saw a great white throne… and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books.” (Revelation 20:11–12)</blockquote>
    All sin and sinners are destroyed:
    <blockquote>“And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.” (Revelation 20:15)</blockquote>
    A new creation begins:
    <blockquote>“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.” (Revelation 21:1)</blockquote>
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The millennium is a vital period in God’s redemptive timeline. It begins with Christ’s return and the resurrection of the righteous and ends with the final judgment and the creation of a new earth. During this time, the saints reign with Christ, the earth lies desolate, Satan is bound, and eventually, evil is brought to a permanent end.

Lesson 24 – The Millennium

The word “millennium” is not found directly in the Bible, but it comes from two Latin words: "mille" meaning "a thousand" and "annus" meaning "year." It refers to the 1,000-year period described in Revelation chapter 20. Scripture says, “And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years” (Revelation 20:4). This thousand-year reign is a significant part of God’s plan, and it gives us hope for the future.

1. The Righteous During the Millennium
During the millennium, the righteous will live and reign with Christ. Revelation 20:4 tells us about those who sit on thrones and are given judgment, and that they will reign with Christ for a thousand years. Jesus Himself promised to return and take His followers to be with Him. He said, “Let not your heart be troubled… I will come again and receive you unto myself” (John 14:1–3). At His second coming, “the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,” and “the dead in Christ shall rise first” (1 Thessalonians 4:16). Then those who are still alive will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:17). The Bible clearly shows that the faithful will be with Christ during the millennium, as Revelation 20:6 says, “They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.”

2. The Unrighteous During the Millennium
While the righteous reign with Christ, the wicked remain dead. Revelation 20:5 explains, “The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” This means only the righteous are raised at Christ’s coming, as affirmed in Revelation 20:6, which calls them “blessed and holy” for having part in the first resurrection. 1 Corinthians 15:23 also states, “They that are Christ’s at His coming.” Meanwhile, those wicked who are alive when Jesus returns will be destroyed. 2 Thessalonians 2:8 says, “Then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth.”

3. Satan During the Millennium
During the millennium, Satan is bound. Revelation 20:2–3 says, “He laid hold on the dragon…and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit.” This “bottomless pit” represents a desolate, empty earth. The prophet Jeremiah described the earth as “without form and void,” with no light and broken-down cities (Jeremiah 4:23–27). The plagues that come before Christ’s return will leave the world in ruins. Revelation 16:18–20 mentions a great earthquake, disappearing islands, and missing mountains. Ezekiel 28:18 describes Satan’s final punishment: “I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.”

4. Events at the Close of the Millennium
When the thousand years are over, the wicked are resurrected. Revelation 20:5 repeats that the rest of the dead do not live again until the end of the thousand years. Jesus spoke of two resurrections: one for life and another for damnation (John 5:28–29). At this time, Satan is released and begins his final deception. Revelation 20:7 says, “Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,” and he will go out to deceive the nations and gather them for battle (Revelation 20:8). But their rebellion is short-lived. God intervenes, and fire comes down from heaven and devours them (Revelation 20:9).
As this final battle ends, the holy city—the New Jerusalem—descends from heaven. John says, “I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God” (Revelation 21:2). Then comes the great white throne judgment. All the dead are judged from what is written in the books (Revelation 20:11–12). Those not found in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:15). After this final judgment, God creates a new heaven and a new earth, as stated in Revelation 21:1: “For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.”

Conclusion
The millennium is a crucial part of God’s redemptive plan. It begins with Christ’s return and the resurrection of the righteous and ends with the final judgment of the wicked and the creation of a new earth. During this time, the saints reign with Christ in heaven, the earth remains desolate, Satan is bound, and ultimately, evil is brought to a final and permanent end. This promises hope, justice, and renewal for all who put their faith in Christ.

  <h2>Lesson 25 - The Home of the Saved</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. The Promise of a Future Home</h3>
  <p>
    God has promised a new home for His people — a renewed earth where righteousness dwells.
    <br>
    <strong>2 Peter 3:13:</strong> “But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.”
    <br>
    This new earth is not just symbolic, but a real, restored creation where the saved will live in peace and holiness.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The New Earth: Hope of the Saints</h3>
  <p>
    The early Christians anchored their hope in this promise of a future inheritance.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Peter 1:3-5:</strong> “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.”
    <br>
    While this hope is centered in heaven, the final destination of the redeemed is the new earth, restored and made perfect by God.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Reality of the Future Life</h3>
  <p>
    The Bible presents the new earth not as a vague spiritual realm, but as a real place with meaningful activity and peace.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Isaiah 65:21-25:</strong> “They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit... They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, says the Lord.”  
        <br>
        This paints a vivid picture of a life of fulfillment, peace, and productivity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revelation 21:1-5:</strong> “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth... He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more... for the former things have passed away.”  
        <br>
        Sin and suffering will be forever gone in this renewed world.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revelation 21:9-27:</strong> Gives a beautiful and symbolic description of the New Jerusalem — a city made of pure gold, with gates of pearl, and foundations of precious stones.  
        <br>
        (Note: Modern Bible versions often include footnotes with contemporary equivalents for measurements.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revelation 22:1-2:</strong> “Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life... flowing from the throne of God... and on either side of the river, the tree of life... and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.”  
        <br>
        This signifies a restoration to Eden-like conditions, and eternal life maintained by access to the tree of life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Isaiah 35:</strong> This chapter describes a transformed land with blossoming deserts, rejoicing people, and healing — a poetic representation of the better land prepared for God's people.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>4. Christ, the King of the New Earth</h3>
  <p>
    Christ will reign as King in this new, eternal kingdom.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Daniel 2:44:</strong> “And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed... it shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever.”  
        <br>
        Earthly kingdoms are temporary, but God’s kingdom is eternal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revelation 22:4:</strong> “They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.”  
        <br>
        The redeemed will have the privilege of seeing Christ face to face — the ultimate joy of heaven.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revelation 21:1:</strong> “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away...”  
        <br>
        This reaffirms God’s plan to renew and restore all things.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The home of the saved is not an abstract or mystical place. It is a restored creation, a real and tangible home, free from sin, suffering, and death. There, Christ reigns as King, and the redeemed live in joyful communion with God, fulfilling the original plan for humanity. The promise of this home inspires faith, hope, and endurance for all believers.

Lesson 25 – The Home of the Saved

On Saturday, November 25, 2023, we reflect on the promise of a future home that God has prepared for His people — a new and renewed earth where righteousness will dwell. This isn’t just a symbolic idea; it’s a real, restored creation. In 2 Peter 3:13, we read: “But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.” God’s promise is clear — a peaceful and holy place awaits those who are saved.
For the early Christians, this promise became the anchor of their hope. They looked forward to a future inheritance, one that is described in 1 Peter 1:3-5 as imperishable, undefiled, and unfading — kept in heaven for believers. Although our hope is presently centered in heaven, Scripture reveals that the final destination for the redeemed is not just heaven, but the new earth, made perfect by God.
This future life is not vague or purely spiritual. The Bible shows the new earth as a tangible, beautiful, and meaningful place of activity and peace. In Isaiah 65:21-25, we see a vivid image: “They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit… They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain.” Similarly, Revelation 21:1-5 tells of a time when God will wipe away every tear, and death will be no more. The former things will have passed away.
The New Jerusalem, described in Revelation 21:9-27, is a place of immense beauty — a city of pure gold with gates of pearl and foundations of precious stones. In Revelation 22:1-2, the Bible speaks of the river of life and the tree of life, whose leaves are for the healing of the nations. This represents a full restoration to Eden-like conditions. Likewise, Isaiah 35 paints a poetic image of deserts blossoming, people rejoicing, and bodies healed — a transformed and glorious land for God's people.
Christ Himself will reign as King over this new and eternal kingdom. In Daniel 2:44, we are told that “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed,” one that will outlast all earthly kingdoms. Revelation 22:4 tells us that the redeemed will see Christ face to face and bear His name on their foreheads — a powerful symbol of belonging and eternal connection. Again in Revelation 21:1, we are reminded: “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.”
In conclusion, the home of the saved is not a mystical or abstract place. It is a renewed and restored creation — real and eternal. In this home, sin, suffering, and death will no longer exist. Christ reigns as King, and the redeemed will live in joyful, everlasting fellowship with God. This glorious promise is what inspires us to keep the faith, to hope with confidence, and to endure whatever trials may come, knowing that our eternal home is secure.
