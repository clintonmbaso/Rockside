<h2>Time-line Summary of the Great Advent Movement</h2>

<p>First we studied the development of the work in broad chronological strokes; then we looked at its various phases of activity and geographical components to get a clearer picture. But our church didn’t develop by phases nor by segments in a coordinated, methodical pattern; it grew as the Spirit of God moved on the minds of men in different places and in different manners to meet the needs of the gospel commission. Geography, phases, concepts, and people are all intertwined throughout the growth and history, creating a strong web of faith in the soon return of Christ encircling the globe.</p>

<p>Following is a brief chronological summary for easy reference (obviously, space limits its completeness and regions may wish to add those dates that are important to them).</p>
