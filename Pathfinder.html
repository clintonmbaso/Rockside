That program is intended for children four years old, with the Little Fish program for children five years old. Children should not start this class before they have passed their fourth birthday.<br>
The NAD manual can be used if you wish to order them from Advent Source (see below). However the cost is fairly high especially when freight is added. The manuals are very colourful with lots of helpful information but they are NOT NECESSARY to run the course. Also it must be remembered that the requirements in this manual are NOT the same as those in the NAD manual. Almost all the material here is taken from that manual, but in most cases it is shortened and there are general articles of helps for leaders and teachers that are omitted here.<br>

However, they have been listed as they are in the NAD manual. It may be that some of the Stars would be best done on a Sunday.<br>

Send them to the Youth Department at the Conference to tamasianoerianto@adventist.org.au or to Norman Tew (normtew@tech2u.com.au). If you have any activities, crafts or stories that would help in any of the requirements of this course please send these also. We have no plans to change this manual but extra teaching helps can always be added to those already on the web site. Thank you.<br>

Though the NAD uses a different wording for the Little Lamb Pledge, we will be using the Adventurer pledge for pre-Adventurers also.<br>
Note that the pledge as used in the South Pacific Division includes the word “can” not “will” as is used in some other areas of the world.<br>

The Little Lamb stars can be sewn on the bottom section of the front of the sash. The Little Fish diamonds can go on the next section of the sash and the Adventurer awards on the top of the sash.<br>
Sashes are being sold by the Mountain View club (currently the price is A$8.00), but these can also be purchased at Girl Guide stores as their colour matches ours. It is recommended that a piece of velcro be sewn under the sash where it crosses the right shoulder, with the matching piece of velcro on the shoulder of the uniform shirt. This will stop the sash from slipping off, as it will do so for small children!<br>
If it is desired to use the Little Lamb Puzzle patch this could be sewn onto the scarf where the Adventurer logo is normally placed. However, this is optional, we are not recommending this. <br>

In this section you will have four different activities that relate to the subject of the meeting. Each<br>
activity will last from 10 to 15 minutes only.<br>
                                                      <br>

Gather the pre-Adventurers into a circle. (This can be done by having the children hold hands. Move backwards slowly until the circle is formed). Discuss what new things they learned this week, or ask questions about what they enjoyed best etc.<br>
Close with a very short prayer. <br>

Thus the use of work books is not compulsory. The use of a display book to store materials produced and/or pictures of activities is a good idea. Use active learning methods.<br>

Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft, one activity, and one discussion on the topic that the children have learnt about Jesus <br>
• Prepare a sheet or blanket tent<br>
Bring oversized T-shirts and head scarves so the children can dress up as in Bible times. Encourage the children to take off their shoes and socks, and pretend to cook, or watch their sheep etc. Or just do dress up letting the children try different ideas, and let them suggest the kinds of toys Jesus might have played with (hint - his father was a carpenter so there would have been wood scraps).<br>
• Play Simon Sa</span><span style="color:#000000;">ys using the term the Shepherd ins</span><span style="color:#231F20;">tead of Simon<br>
Draw an outline of a lamb, and prepare pictures of shepherds. Let the children glue cotton wool onto the lamb picture. While they are working or in a de-brief afterward discuss how a shepherd deals with a lost lamb and how Jesus deals with us when we wander from the way he wants us to go.<br>
• With paddlepop sticks and white glue let the children build flat topped Bible land houses. <br>
Talk about the fact that Jesus was a carpenter.<br>
This is an Iranian game that can be played sitting in a circle, and could easily be the type of game that Jesus played with his friends. The children sit in a circle with a leader. The leader does an action and the children take turns round the circle copying the action (pull a face, tug on ear or nose, stroke the hair of the person next to you, etc). In the original game anyone who laughed or made a giggle or a noise was out, but let the children stay in though trying to exercise self-control.<br>

Bible stories could be of Adam &amp; Eve, with Cain &amp; Abel; Noah’s family; Joseph or David and their brothers. A story of a modern family would be just as good. Remember modern families do not all have mothers and fathers, so include grandparents, uncles, aunts, siblings etc. Remind the children that we are all part of the family of Jesus.<br>

There are all kinds of families I see, Some are two and some are three (hold up two then three fingers) Some are eight and some are four (change the number of fingers showing) And some are more and more and more! (Raise and lower all 10 fingers.)<br>
Do four activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and one activity, plus one discussion on the things the children have learnt about families. Here are three suggestions.<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Play house. <br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Family Tree. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Draw an outline of a tree with large leaves. Each child will need to go to an adult to place names of the people in their family on their tree. Make sure the child’s name is on one of the leaves. (Nanna, Mummy, Daddy are suitable names, you do not have to use first names etc).<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Family matching. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Find pictures of parents, grand-parents, children etc (two of each!). On index cards, make 16 to 20 cards in a pack with 8 to 10 pairs of pictures. Have an adult with two to three children, to supervise playing game and discuss about families. Spread cards out face down, turn up two cards, if they match the child keeps them. As the child takes a matching pair ask what family member would this be (mother, sister etc). The NAD manual suggests www.gettyimages.com but going to Google, and selecting images, the father, mother, boy girl etc may be quicker.<br>

• You will need big sheets of white paper, plus oddments of crayons, buttons, scraps and paste. First have each child lie on the big sheet and draw round them (they do not have to lie out flat). Then let them decorate the outline of themselves, with colours, scraps etc. (NB - Observe what, how &amp; where the decorations go)<br>
• Name game, stand in a circle, name a child and bounce the ball to them, they return it. Make sure to give each child a turn and name them.<br>
• Make a sheet of paper for each child with their name outlined in dots. Let them trace in the name and decorate the paper with colours, glitter etc.<br>
• Paper bag puppets. You will need crayons, paper bags, hair coloured pieces of wool (long and short), and some buttons. Show one you have made then let the children glue on the hair with buttons for eyes, draw in mouth, nose etc. They do not have to use their own hair colouring.<br>
• Unique Me. Weigh each child and measure their height. Have them blow into a balloon to see how big they can go on one breath. Take a finger print and let them look at it through a magnifying glass. Taste samples of fruits and vegetables and record which they liked best. Record their voices (in advance) and let the group guess the names of the voices.<br>
• I can be . . . Collect pictures of firemen, nurses, police, chefs, artists, builders, veterinarians, etc, etc. together with symbolic clothes for each. Let the children choose and dress up.<br>

• A suggestion that would suit the story of Noah would be to have each child chose a colour of paint to place on their hand. Then each child places their colour on their own and everyone else in their group’s piece of paper, to make rainbows.<br>
• Three legged obstacle course. Beware some small children will not have enough coordination to work with another child and will need to be paired with an adult. Lay out a route around obstacles in the room and have them co-operate as friends to get around the course.<br>
• Song - The Farmer in the Dell. See http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/farmer.htm for the words and music (there is a lot of other useful material on the kids section of this site).<br>
• Everyone forms a circle with one adult in the middle, each time the song is sung the last person to go to the middle calls another person by name to join them until all the children are in the middle.<br>
• Song - If you’re happy and you know it. Adapt the words of the song at </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/happand.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"> , use the word “friendly” instead of happy, and some of the actions can</span><span style="color:#000000;"> be modified to types of greetings. Song - Jesus is a Friend of Mine (action point to self) and for the last line sing “And He is -----&gt;s friend too using the name of another child. Use the music for Mary </span><span style="color:#231F20;">had a little lamb - </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/mary.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"><br>
• Bible Friends dress up. Dress up in Bible style clothing. In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, havet each child name a Bible friend.<br>

Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by discussing what counting is. Explain that counting is the process of determining the quantity of items.<br>
2. Introduce the concept of numbers as symbols that represent quantities. Show them a number card (e.g., &quot;1&quot;) and explain that it represents one item.<br>
3. Emphasize the importance of numbers in our daily lives, such as when we tell time or count items.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 1: Counting Objects (10 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute a set of objects (toys, blocks, etc.) to each student.<br>
2. Ask the students to count the objects in their set, starting from 1 and going up to 10.<br>
3. Encourage them to say the numbers aloud as they count the objects.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 2: Number Recognition (10 minutes):<br>
1. Show the students a number card (e.g., &quot;3&quot;).<br>
2. Ask them to identify the number and show that many fingers.<br>
3. Repeat this with several number cards, gradually increasing the complexity.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 3: Matching Numbers and Objects (10 minutes):<br>
1. Place a random number of objects (1-10) on a table.<br>
2. Show the students a number card and ask them to find the corresponding number of objects on the table.<br>
3. This activity reinforces the association between numbers and quantities.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 4: Writing Numerals (5 minutes):<br>
1. Have the students practice writing numerals on their individual whiteboards.<br>
2. Start with simpler numbers like 1 and 2 and gradually progress to more complex numbers.<br>
3. Encourage them to write the numerals neatly.<br>
                                                      <br>

Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by introducing the concept of counting forward and backward using a number line.<br>
2. Explain that a number line is a visual tool with numbers placed at equal intervals. It helps us see the order of numbers.<br>
3. Show the large number line chart and point out that 1 is on the left end, and numbers increase as you move to the right.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 1: Counting Forward (15 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute small number lines to each student. These should have the numbers 1 to 20 printed on them.<br>
2. Ask students to stand in a circle and start at number 1.<br>
3. One by one, have each student say the next number in the sequence, continuing up to 20. Encourage them to use their number lines for reference.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 2: Counting Backward (15 minutes):<br>
1. Using the whiteboard, draw a simple number line from 10 to 1.<br>
2. Explain that counting backward is like going in the opposite direction on the number line.<br>
3. Have the students take turns saying the numbers in reverse order, starting from 10 and ending at 1.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 3: Number Line Exploration (5 minutes):<br>
1. Show the large number line chart again and ask students to point to different numbers.<br>
2. Ask them questions like, &quot;What comes after 7?&quot; or &quot;What's two numbers before 15?&quot;<br>
3. This activity reinforces their understanding of the number line's organization.<br>
                                                      <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>

Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by discussing the concept of patterns in counting.<br>
2. Explain that patterns are sequences of numbers that follow a particular rule or order.<br>
3. Mention that today, you will explore some simple counting patterns.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 1: Counting by Twos (15 minutes):<br>
1. Start by counting with the class from 1 to 10.<br>
2. After reaching 10, introduce the concept of counting by twos.<br>
3. Count together by twos, starting from 2, and continue up to 20.<br>
4. Encourage students to observe the pattern and recognize that they're skipping every other number.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 2: Counting by Fives (10 minutes):<br>
1. Count together from 1 to 10 again.<br>
2. After reaching 10, introduce counting by fives.<br>
3. Count by fives, starting from 5 and going up to 25.<br>
4. Help students notice the pattern of adding 5 each time.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 3: Identifying Ones Place Patterns (10 minutes):<br>
1. Display random numbers on the whiteboard, such as 12, 23, 34, and 45.<br>
2. Ask students to focus on the ones place (the digit in the rightmost position).<br>
3. Discuss how this digit changes from 1 to 9, and then repeats the pattern.<br>
4. Practice identifying this pattern by displaying more numbers.<br>
                                                      <br>

Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by explaining the concept of ordinal numbers. Emphasize that ordinal numbers tell us the position or order of things.<br>
2. Write the words &quot;first,&quot; &quot;second,&quot; and &quot;third&quot; on the whiteboard and discuss how they are different from regular numbers.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 1: Understanding Ordinal Numbers (10 minutes):<br>
1. Show flashcards with ordinal numbers to the class, starting with &quot;first&quot; and going up to at least &quot;tenth.&quot;<br>
2. Have students repeat the words and discuss their meanings. For example, &quot;first&quot; means the thing in the front, &quot;second&quot; is the one after the first, and so on.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 2: Ordinal Numbers in Action (15 minutes):<br>
1. Create a simple scenario where students are &quot;lining up&quot; for a school activity or game.<br>
2. Ask students to stand in a line, and then call out students one by one, assigning them ordinal numbers, such as &quot;You are the first in line,&quot; &quot;You are the second in line,&quot; and so on.<br>
3. Repeat the process a few times, changing the order each time, so students understand the concept better.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 3: Ordinal Number Objects (10 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute small objects or counters to students.<br>
2. Instruct students to arrange the objects in different orders and label them with ordinal numbers. For example, they might put the objects in a line and label them &quot;third,&quot; &quot;first,&quot; &quot;second,&quot; etc.<br>
                                                      <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the lesson by reinforcing the use and meaning of ordinal numbers.<br>
2. Discuss real-life situations where we use ordinal numbers, such as races (1st place, 2nd place) or ordering at a restaurant (1st order, 2nd order).<br>

Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by explaining what &quot;doubles&quot; mean in the context of addition – it's when we add the same number to itself.<br>
2. Write a simple double addition fact on the whiteboard, such as 2 + 2, and explain that it's the same as adding 2 twice.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      <br>
Duration: 45 minutes<br>
                                                      <br>
Materials:<br>
- Whiteboard and markers<br>
- Number flashcards (0-9)<br>

                                                      <br>
Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by explaining the concept of regrouping in addition.<br>
2. Clarify that regrouping is needed when the sum of digits in a column is greater than 9.<br>
3. Use a simple example, such as 7 + 5, to illustrate that when we add 7 and 5, the sum is 12, and we need to regroup or carry over the 1.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 1: Visual Regrouping (15 minutes):<br>
1. Demonstrate regrouping using visual aids like counters or base-ten blocks.<br>
2. Write a two-digit addition problem on the board, such as 38 + 47, and use the visual aids to show how to regroup.<br>
3. Start by adding the ones column: 8 + 7 = 15. Use the visual aids to show taking one of the ten blocks from the ones column and adding it to the tens column.<br>
4. Write the new tens column as 4 (from 3 + 1), and the ones column as 5 (from 5 in the ones column).<br>
5. Emphasize that this is how we carry over when the sum is greater than 9.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 2: Guided Practice (15 minutes):<br>
1. Provide students with additional two-digit addition problems that require regrouping. Guide them through solving these problems on the whiteboard.<br>
2. Encourage students to use visual aids or drawings to help them understand and visualize the regrouping process.<br>
3. Ensure that each student has the opportunity to participate in solving at least one problem on the board.<br>
                                                      <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the lesson by reviewing the concept of regrouping or carrying over in addition.<br>
2. Reinforce that visual aids are a helpful tool for understanding this process.<br>

Subtracting Single-Digit Numbers<br>
                                                      </strong><br>
Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to subtract single-digit numbers from 0 to 9, practice subtraction facts, and understand that subtraction is not commutative.<br>
                                                      <br>
Duration: 45 minutes<br>
                                                      <br>
Materials:<br>
- Whiteboard and markers<br>
- Number flashcards (0-9)<br>
- Counters or small objects (e.g., buttons, chips)<br>
                                                      <br>
Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Start by explaining the concept of subtraction. Emphasize that subtraction is the opposite of addition, where we find the difference between two numbers.<br>
2. Discuss the importance of understanding that subtraction is not commutative, meaning the order matters.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 1: Subtraction Facts (15 minutes):<br>
1. Show number flashcards one at a time (e.g., 5) and ask the students to call out the subtraction facts for that number (e.g., 5 - 0, 5 - 1, 5 - 2, etc.).<br>
2. Discuss how these subtraction facts represent different ways to subtract from the same number.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 2: Hands-On Subtraction (15 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute a set of counters or small objects to each student.<br>
2. Demonstrate subtraction with a simple problem, e.g., 7 - 3. Start with 7 counters and &quot;take away&quot; 3, counting what's left.<br>
3. Have students practice subtracting different numbers using their counters.<br>
                                                      <br>
Activity 3: Commutative Property (10 minutes):<br>
1. Write a subtraction problem on the whiteboard, e.g., 6 - 2.<br>
2. Explain that subtraction is not commutative, so 6 - 2 is not the same as 2 - 6. Write 2 - 6 on the board and show that it results in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context.<br>
3. Emphasize that the order of numbers matters in subtraction.<br>
                                                      <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the lesson by reviewing the key points: subtracting single-digit numbers, practicing subtraction facts, and understanding the non-commutative nature of subtraction.<br>
2. Reinforce that subtraction helps us find differences or solve problems like &quot;How much is left?&quot;<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      <br>
Assessment:<br>
- Observe students' participation in activities to ensure they can use visual aids to understand subtraction.<br>
- Review their completed homework to assess their ability to apply these concepts.<br>
                                                      <br>
Adaptations:<br>
- Provide additional practice or support for students who may need it, using manipulatives or simplified subtraction problems.<br>
- Challenge advanced students to extend their understanding to more complex story problems or introduce addition and subtraction with larger numbers using similar visual aids.<br>

.(120 Min.)<br>
1. Understanding Creativity<br>
Some of the purposes and values in the use of creative activities are<br>
as follows:<br>
1) It makes learning more enjoyable, lasting, and meaningful.<br>
2) It provides opportunity for self-expression and development of<br>
creativity.<br>
3) It instills pride in accomplishment and builds self-confidence.<br>
4) It contributes to the development of proper self-concepts.<br>
6) It fulfills a Pathfinder's need for individual expression.<br>
.(45 min.)<br>
....45 min.)<br>
5) It provides for participation in group situations and reaction to<br>
established group approval and behavior.<br>
.(75 min.)<br>
8) It prompts respect for both adults and peer leadership.<br>
10) It helps the Pathfinder respect the property of others.<br>
11) It teaches cooperation, sharing, and taking turns.<br>
7) It relieves periods of physical restlessness with meaningful activity,<br>
coordinating mind and muscle.<br>
9) It affords opportunity to practice principles of Christian living.<br>
12) It can emphasizea Bible concept or illustrate a truth.<br>
b. What are the steps in a creative process?<br>
                                                      <br>
1) Preparation (Orientation)<br>
13) It provides opportunities for the Pathfinder to express his or her<br>
relationship to God and a response to Bible teaching.<br>
Keeping these purposes and values in mind, teachers and leaders will<br>
have opportunity to observe the Pathfinder's developing theological<br>
concepts and behavioral responses. This will help guide the leaders in<br>
their teaching, in their relationships with the Pathfinders, and in the<br>
selection of creative activities to effect successful learning experiences.<br>
(a) What is the problem and what are the approaches?<br>
                                                      <br>
Ask questions: Why is it necessary? Where should it be done? When<br>
should it be done? Who should do it? What should be done? How<br>
should it be done?<br>
                                                      <br>

Seek parallels: What is there like this from which I might get an idea?<br>
Is there something similar I could parially copy?<br>
Modify: WVhat if this were changed? How can this be altered for<br>
the better?<br>
Magnify: What about making it bigger? What strength can we add?<br>
Could this be multiplied?<br>
Subtract and divide: What if this were smaller? What could I omit?<br>
How about dividing?<br>
Substitution: What else instead? Who else? Where else?<br>
Rearrange: Change the pattern. What about sequence? Another layout?<br>
Cause and effect (transpose). Timing?<br>
Vice-versa: What about the opposite? Can we topsy-turvy&quot;?<br>
Surprises: How about doing the unexpected?<br>
Combine: What if this and that were put together?<br>

Blind errors<br>
Errors of incompetence<br>

&quot;Once profitable orientation toward creative work is lost and<br>
frustration begins to mount, there is no sure technique of<br>
recovery but change and rest, difficult as it may be to give one's<br>
self up to these things. Sleep, travel, quiet relaxation, leisurely<br>
walking or not too strenuous muscular exercise, shutting one's<br>
self in silence in a room, lively so cial participation, any non-<br>
habitual or non-routine response - all may be alternation of<br>

2. Teaching the Pathfinder Curriculum Creatively<br>
The Pathfinder Curriculum will be taught to the Pathfinders when they meet<br>
together as a whole club, or as they work together as a unit or in classes.<br>
There will also be times when Pathfinders will need to study mate rial by<br>
themselves.<br>
Teachers will therefore recognize that it will be important to assess each<br>
Pathfinder, cach group of Pathfinders, each requirement, the physical<br>
surroundings where teaching takes place, and a whole range of further factors<br>
that lead to the successful transfer of knowledge.<br>
It is important to remember that the overall aim of teaching the curriculum is<br>
to allow the Pathfinders to develop an appropriate attitude toward further<br>
learning. This will take place best when teachers make efforts to bring about<br>
the right atmosphere for learning in the place of teaching. Learning takes place<br>
best when:<br>
a. It's a time for fun<br>
Pathfinders will learn to love the things they enjoy doing, and enjoyment<br>
stems from happy surroundings. If the teacher is overly stern and<br>
demanding, or constantly finding fault, learning will become a burden. If<br>
there's no place for humor and laughter; if the Pathfinders are always being<br>
told to remain quiet, to sit and listen, and there is no sense of adventure<br>
and learning, the experience will be of little value.<br>
b. It's a time for acceptance and understanding<br>
.(75 min.)<br>
Pathfinders will be more re ady to show interest in info rmation and learn<br>
values from the instructor if they feel accepted and understood.<br>
Acceptance stems from recognition of the Pathfinders' worth and value,<br>
and the knowledge that their behavior is their best attempt to deal with<br>
their current thoughts, feelings, and situation. This may not mean that<br>
their behavior is acceptable, but that they are accepted as people.<br>
Nothing can take away the value of each person to God, and all people<br>
C. I's a time for recognition and creativity<br>
will respond best when they are accepted as important and worthwhile.<br>
Likewise, it is important to understand each Pathfinder. Become familiar<br>
with why the youth does behave in a certain way, and while you may not<br>
approve of his or her lifestyle, you can at least attempt to understand. It<br>
is important to convey to all Pathfinders a genuine acceptance and<br>
understanding.<br>
d. It's a time for imagination and creativity<br>
Pathfinders will be encouraged in their learning when instructors take<br>
the time to give genuine praise and affirmation. Pathfinders need<br>
recognition for their best efforts, and instructors can do much to lead<br>
them on in their search for knowledge by sincere and honest rewards.<br>
125<br>
Instructors need to give urgent study to this aspect of teaching. So many<br>
good clas ses fail because of lack of imagination and variety. Creativity is<br>
really essential in teaching Pathfinders. In an age where much<br>
e. It's a time for effective communication<br>
in formation is transfe rred through the medium of TV, any straight talk<br>
may well appear slow, boring, and unattractive. Successful instructors<br>
will put time and energy into discovering a whole range of ways of<br>
doing some task differently. They may choose film and discussion, role<br>
play, drama, puppetry, collage, anything other than what is expected!<br>
Pathfinders enjoy surprises; they enjoy change; they enjoy variety. Call on<br>
all the re sources you have at hand. Then have another look, and find<br>
some more. Go all out to make every class the most interesting one you<br>
have attempted.<br>
f. It's a time for fairne ss and justice<br>
Learning will also take place best if the Pathfinders recognize that they are<br>
being listened to. They will learn to appreciate their worth as they discover<br>
that their instructor considers their answers worthwhile – that the<br>
instructor shows approval of their attempts at understanding the material.<br>
The Pathfinders will feel more accepted where there's no sarcasm or put-<br>
down, and where there is a sense of honesty and trust.<br>
g. It's a time for involvement<br>
Pathfinders are quick to notice partiality, unfairness, or favoritism.<br>
Instructors will need to be conscious of the need to be equal in praise and<br>
discipline.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
Instructors should seek to involve the class as much as possible. View the<br>
class as the teachers: allow them to lead out in different segments get<br>
them doing something! Seek dialogue with the class to see how they are<br>
enjoying working on a particular requirement, and review with them what<br>
h. It's time for constant assessment<br>
Constantly evaluate the work you are doing and check to see if you are<br>
reaching and achieving the goals you set for yourself and the class. There<br>
are many factors that will affect the success of your class, including simple<br>
details such as the physical setting for the place of learning. Are there too<br>
many distractions? Is the seating arrangement too restrictive? Is the room<br>
too hot or too cold? Is there not enough light, or too much noise? Have<br>
they just come in from loud, fast-moving games, and haven't yet settled<br>
down? Keep an eye on all these things - they are worth checking.<br>
i. It's a time for cooperation<br>
Teaching a particular class will best happen when done in association with<br>
the overall plans of the club. A coordinated program will be needed for each<br>
Pathfinder event, and instructors, staff members, and the direc tor will work<br>
well together when all are aware of what the program times are.<br>
Special Teaching Arrangements<br>
In special cases, provision can be made for isolated Pathfinders to participate<br>
in the program apart from the Pathfinder organization. Likewise, provision<br>
can be made for the physically handicapped and the disadvan taged. Contact<br>
your local conference youth ministries personnel to work out details for<br>
exceptions.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
Teaching Methods<br>
No attempt has been made here to set out every detail of teaching methods.<br>
Each class requirement will require a different approach, depending on factors<br>
such as time of day, place, number of participants, availability of resources, and<br>
similar factors. Wherever possible, instructors should plan several alternative<br>
teaching methods for each requirement, and use the one best suited to the<br>
group and the occasion. Before setting out to teach a class, teachers would do<br>
well to consider the following:<br>
1. Study the class curriculum<br>
Teachers are encouraged to be familiar with the overall direction of the<br>
Pathfinder curriculum. Study the flow chart found in the training<br>
manuals, which outline the development of the selected areas of study.<br>
Become very aware of the place your particular class has in the overall<br>
scheme of the program.<br>
Then become familiar with the particular class requirements for the class<br>
of Pathfinders that you will have under your care (Friend, Companion<br>
etc.). Become aware of what is expected of the Pathfinders; know what<br>
the requirement is asking for. Make sure you understand the stated<br>
objective for the requirement, and then familiarize yourself with the<br>
resource material.<br>
Assess the number and needs of vour class<br>
Get to know details about the members of your Pathfinder class. Who are<br>
they, what are their learning abilities, and what are their attitudes to the<br>
particular subjects? Are there any Pathfinders in your group who require<br>
extra help in learning information? Could there be problems in the<br>
particular methods you choose to teach the class?<br>
3. Work out your teaching plan<br>
Instructors will need to develop a suitable teaching plan based on<br>
the following:<br>
a. The total number of 30-minute periods required to teach the class<br>
b. The number of 30-minute periods required to teach each section of<br>
the Classwork (Bible search, camping etc.)<br>
c. The alternative teaching methods available for teaching each<br>
requirement<br>
d. The particular time and place when you will be teaching the<br>
requirement<br>
e. The availability of additional resources and background material<br>
127<br>
f. The method of evaluation to be used when the requirement is<br>
completed<br>
they have learned.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
PATHFINDER CLASSES<br>
In considering the Pathfinder program, there are many areas in which<br>
one should become involved in order to guide the development ofa<br>
well-to unded Pathfinder.<br>
Pathfinder Classwork<br>
&quot;The children are to be trained to become missionaries; they must be<br>
helped to understand distinctly what they must do to be saved' Counsels to<br>
Parents, Teachers, and Students, p. 168. And the best preparation is the<br>
&quot;harmonious development of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual<br>
powers. It prepares the student for the joy of service in this world, and for<br>
the higher joy of wider service in the world to come&quot; (Education, p. 13).<br>
&quot;Since both men and women have a part in homemaking, boys as well as<br>
girls should gain a knowledge of household duties. To make a bed and put<br>
a room in order, to wash dishes, to prepare a meal, to wash and repair his<br>
own clothing, is a training that need not make any boy less manly; it will<br>
make him happier and more useful. And if girls, in turn, could learn<br>
use the saw and the hammer, as well as the rake and the hoe, they would<br>
be better fitted to meet the emergencies of life Education, pp. 216-217).<br>
tc<br>
It was from the study of this and other similar messages that the Pathfinder<br>
Classes were developed, and all the requirements for these classes are based<br>
on this instruction. They include, therefore, Bible and nature study, the<br>
learning of useful and helpful things to do about the home, out-of-door<br>
activities, first aid, personal and home hygiene, physical fitness, and service<br>
to others.<br>
All of this helps the youth to find true happiness in witnessing and to become<br>
a member of a great army of Adventist youth whose talents and energies are<br>
committed to Christ. They will be those whose hands are ready to grasp any<br>
emergency and turn it to the glory of the great Master Guide. The Pathfinder<br>
Classes include Friend, Companion, Explorer, Ranger, Voyager, and Guide.<br>
Pathfinder Classes and School1<br>
128<br>
Onc of thc main objcctives of the Pathfindcr Club is to prcparc the youth<br>
for life with its emergencies and help the youth to become useful to both<br>
God and man. The Pathfinder class program has been established with this<br>
in mind. It therefore seems important to guide the Pathfinder into this<br>
program of self-improvement.<br>
Since the club director has the responsibility to oversee the completion of all<br>
Pathfinder class requirements where the church operates a school, the<br>
director should go the school and make arrangements to work with the<br>
teachers in the Glasswork, then continue to keep in touch with the teachers<br>
to confirm the Pathfinders' progress. All Investiture services are to be<br>
arranged by the Pathfinder Club director with the area<br>
Pathfinder Advanced Classes<br>
Where there is a church and a school dealing with many of the same<br>
Pathfinder age children/youth, the Path finder Club and the schoolteacher<br>
should work closely together in helping the Pathfinders finish their class<br>
requirements. The school might sponsor memory work and reading the<br>
required books; the club could help with the skill requirements. The school<br>
can easily help the Pathfinder get a needed Honor in connection with regular<br>
Classwork. Then the club can help in getting other Honors that are hard for<br>
the school to complete. Among the most difficult requirements to complete<br>
are the swimming skills, important skills that all should enjoy. The ability to<br>
handle oneself in water in an emergency could be the means of saving a life.<br>
The club may take the initiative and arrange for swimming lessons during the<br>
year so that this requirement can be completed.<br>
The Advanced Class levels are based on outdoor skills. These levels are best<br>
suited to the Pathfinder Club. To be able to enjoy the out-o f-doors and to be<br>
129<br>
able to meet emergencies are good reasons why these skills should be taught<br>
by every club.<br>
coordinator/conference youth director.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
AY Honors<br>
&quot;As a rule, the exercise most beneficial to the youth will be found in useful<br>
employment. The little child finds both diversion and development play;<br>
and his sports should be such as to promote not only physical, but mental<br>
and spiri tual growth. As he gains strength and intelligence, the best<br>
recreation will be found in some line of effort that is useful. That which<br>
trains the hand to helpfulness, and teaches the young to bear their share of<br>
life's burdens, is most effective in promoting the growth of mind and<br>
character. ... it is essential for every youth to have a thorough acquaintance<br>
During the Pathfinder years youth love to work on AY Honors and to display<br>
them after they have been earned.<br>
Tips for Maintaining Enthusiasm for Pathfinder Honors<br>
1. Have a definite date for completion. When the class is started, plan to<br>
finish the work within that time period. This gives the student that<br>
enthusiasm needed to know that the class is moving along and going some<br>
place. Ifit goes over into the next period, interest will wane and it will be<br>
harder to complete.<br>
2. Make the classwork worthwhile. If interest is to be kept at a high level the<br>
classwork must not only be fun but also informative and helpful. If<br>
requirements are glossed over lightly the student gets the idea that the<br>
Honor doesn't mean much. Before receiving the Honor a test should be<br>
given so that it can be seen that the person knows the answer to all<br>
questions. The Pathfinder must do all the requirements. A class notebook<br>
is helpful in keeping up interest, and it also gives the student something<br>
to take home that can be a source of reference in the work accomplished.<br>
It also helps parents feel that the child is really getting something<br>
worthwhile.<br>
3. Waiving requirements. In some of the class requirements there may be<br>
something that cannot be done your area. No club may decide that a<br>
certain re quirement cannot be met and therefore unilate rally waive the<br>
requirement. The conference/mission youth director must be notified<br>
and approve of any change in the published requirements. When this<br>
approval has been given in writing, the club is then free to change or<br>
waive the requirement as instructed.<br>
4. Meeting Path finder Honor requirements. The following guidelines will<br>
serve in checking Pathfinder Honor requirements.<br>
a. The work must actually be performed. Each question must be<br>
answered correctly and each requirement must have been met. Honors<br>
should not be given on the idea that the person could easily do the<br>
requirement.<br>
b. All Honors must be signed for by the instructor, conference youth<br>
director, Master Guide, Pathfinder Club director, or church-school<br>
teacher on the special form provided by the conference.<br>
5. Encourage each Pathfinder to aim at Master Awards. Pathfinder<br>
Honors are categorized into the following groups:<br>
Arts and Crafts<br>

A Pathfinder may earn a MASTER AWARD by completing seven<br>
Honors in a given category. After completion of the seven Honors in one<br>
category, the Pathfinder should inform the Path finder director, who will<br>
contact the conference youth ministries director to secure the Master<br>
Award patch. Like the Pathfinder Honors, the Master Award is presented<br>
preferably at a club meeting, campout, school, church, or Investiture. For<br>
additional information and a complete list of Honors see the Path finder<br>

AY Honors<br>
&quot;As a rule, the exercise most beneficial to the youth will be found in useful<br>
employment. The little child finds both diversion and development in play;<br>
and his sports should be such as to promote not only physical, but mental<br>
and spiritual growth. As he gains strength and intelligence, the best<br>
recreation will be found in some line of effort that is use ful. That which<br>
trains the hand to helpfulness, and teaches the young to bear their share of<br>
life's burdens, is most effective in promoting the growth of mind and<br>
character. . it is essential for every youth to have a thorough acquaintance<br>
with everyday duties&quot; (Education, pp. 215-216).<br>
During the Pathfinder years youth love to work on AY Honors and to display<br>
them after they have been earned.<br>
Tips for Maintaining Enthusiasm for Pathfinder Honors<br>
1. Have a definite date for completion. When the class is started, plan to<br>
finish the work within that time period. This gives the student that<br>
enthusiasm needed to know that the class is moving along and going some<br>
place. If it goes over into the next period, interest will wane and it will be<br>
harder to complete.<br>
2. Make the classwork worthwhile. If interest is to be kept at a high level the<br>
classwork must not only be fun but also informative and helpful. If<br>
requirements are glossed over lightly the student gets the idea that the<br>
Honor doesn't mean much. Before receiving the Honor a test should be<br>
given so that it can be seen that the person knows the answer to all<br>
questions. The Path finder must do all the requirements. A class notebook<br>
is helpful in keeping up interest, and it also gives the student something<br>
to take home that can be a source of reference in the work accomplished.<br>
It also helps parents feel that the child is really getting something<br>
worthwhile.<br>
3. Waiving requirements. In some of the class requirements there may be<br>
something that cannot be done in your area. No club may decide that a<br>
certain requirement cannot be met and therefore unilaterally waive the<br>
requirement. The conference/mission youth director must be notified<br>
and approve of any change in the published requirements. When this<br>
approval has been given in writing, the club is then free to change or<br>
waive the requirement as instructed.<br>
4. Meeting Path finder Honor requirements. T'he following guidelines will<br>
serve in checking Pathfinder Honor requirements.<br>
a. The work must actually be performed. Each question must be<br>
answered correctly and each requirement must have been met. Honors<br>
should not be given on the idea that the person could easily do the<br>
requirement.<br>
b. All Honors must be signed for by the instructor, conference youth<br>
director, Master Guide, Pathfinder Club director, or church-school<br>
teacher on the special form provided by the conference.<br>
5. Encourage each Pathfinder to aim at Master Awards. Pathfinder<br>
Honors are categorized into the following groups:<br>
Arts and Crafts<br>
Health and Science<br>
Household Arts<br>
Nature<br>
Outdoor Industries<br>
Outreach<br>

6. Investiture Services.<br>
It is the responsibility of the Pathfinder Club director to a sk the<br>
conference to conduct the Investiture service. Where there is no club, the<br>
church-school teacher places the request. All who are to be invested must<br>
be able to present their Pathfinder Class card to be signed by the<br>
conference youth ministries director prior to the Investiture service.<br>
Records are kept both by the Pathfinder Club secretarvy and the<br>
conference o ffice of all who receive certificates, Honors, and pins.<br>

b. Benefits to the Individual (20 min.)<br>
In this section we emphasize the importance of camping and outdoor<br>
education in the Pathfinder program. It must be emphasized that we are<br>
only discussing basic aspects in this session-the real learning takes place<br>
in the outdoors.<br>
                                                      <br>
Outdoor living holds a tremendous potential in spiritual values and character-building elements. Campcraft offers great opportunity for practicing democratic group procedures; for building self-reliance, resourcefulness, self-discipline, and respect for other people; for practical application of nature lore and for its greatest appreciation; and best of all – Pathfinders like it. It is therefore recommended that, outdoor living with its multi-skilled requirements compose a large segment of the year's Pathfinder program.<br>
                                                      <br>
This is especially true when one considers that familiarity with the<br>
wilderness may be a great asset in the days to come. The experience that<br>
is gained through fellowship in camping and the skills developed in<br>
outdoor survival will be very helpful to God's people in the time of<br>
trouble.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. A perception of nature's blueprint for and interdependent upon of things.<br>
In this age of artificial amusements and synthetic excitement, we<br>
should turn to outdoor recreation. God counsels in Messages to Young<br>
People, pages 380, 381 &quot;There are modes of recreation which are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind. An enlightened,<br>
discrimina ting mind will find abundant means for entertainment and<br>
diversion, from sources not only innocent, but instructive. Recreation<br>
in the open air, the contemplation of the works of God in nature,<br>
will be of the highest benefit.&quot;<br>
Camping provides many opportunities for individual and group<br>
development. Let us discuss these under two headings: Benefits to<br>
the Individual and The Camper's Lifestyle.<br>
                                                      <br>
1. An intimate knowledge of nature with a love for all her facets which<br>
will never leave and will constantly bring back nostalgic memories<br>
and a longing to be outdoors again.<br>
a each other andg all things in balance<br>
one's place in the scheme<br>
                                                      <br>
3. A meaningful spiritual awakening that reveals God's presence and<br>
touch in everything as the camper views the majesty of a high<br>
mountain, the peace of a quiet valley, the glory of a colorful sunset,<br>
the glint of sun-light on the lake, or dewdrops glistening on an<br>
intricate spider web.<br>
                                                      <br>
4. An understanding of the true meaning of conserving natural<br>
resources and the reasons that immediate action is necessary if we<br>
are to save any of the little that remains after so many years of<br>
neglect and destruction by our affluent society, which has<br>
assumed that the supply of natural resources is inexhaustible.<br>
                                                      <br>
5. A new self-respect and self-confidence as one learns to manage for<br>
oneself and do things others may previously have done for him or her.<br>
Others are too busy with their own jobs to pamper or pick up after<br>
another campe.<br>
                                                      <br>
6. A pride in one's ability to improvise and make do with what is available.<br>
At camp the Pathfinder cannot run to the store to replace something<br>
damaged or satisfy the whim of the moment.<br>
                                                      <br>
7. A feeling of at-homeness in the out-of-doors as one learns to use<br>
natural materials, selecting and preparing those best suited to his or her<br>
needs with such simple tools as an axe, knife, or saw.<br>
                                                      <br>
8. A respect for the dignity of work and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
sweating and struggling to cook over a smoky fire, construct a lean-to<br>
shelter, or build a bridge across a stream.<br>
                                                      <br>
9. Pride in good health and physical fitness that vigorous outdoor life<br>
brings as it stimulates the camper's lungs and heart, exercises muscles,<br>
and produces an appetite for the simple, nutritious meals cooked out-<br>
doors or planned and served indoors.<br>
                                                      <br>
10. A new and more realistic sense of values as one notes how unimportant<br>
such things as money, material possessions, IQ, and fine clothes are in<br>
assessing the true worth of an individual. In camp one finds that the<br>
happiest, best liked, and most respected counselors and campers have<br>
spurned outward appearances and material possessions.<br>
                                                      <br>
11. A feeling of community, pride, and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
serving others, as one maintains the campsite for the benefit of present<br>
and future campers.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <em>c. Benefits of Camping Activities</em><br>
1. Developing lifetime hobbies and sometimes a vocation. Experience in a<br>
wide variety of activities discloses the canper's interests as well as<br>
aptitudes and broadens his or her perspectives, building unders tanding<br>
and appreciation for the interests of others. Camping aims to develop all-<br>
around abilities rather than specialization in a few, as is so often done in<br>
school sports and other activities in which only a few are chosen to<br>
participate while the majority remain on the sidelines to cheer.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. Encourages one to try to improve one's own performance. Although<br>
there is enough competition to give those with superior ability a<br>
chance to shine, most of the emphasis is on self-improvement. This<br>
is preferable to the situation in a highly competitive program where<br>
a few nearly always do well and may beconme smug and conceited,<br>
while others are usually well down the scale, become dejected, and<br>
have a &quot; don't care&quot; attitude.<br>
3. Having just plain fun as well as the excitement and new experiences<br>
every normal child craves but doing it in a wholly safe and sane way.<br>
Youngsters who can find the ir thrills this way will never &quot;need&quot; to<br>
resort to stealing, fighting, or killing just for &quot;kicks.&quot;<br>
4. Developing a wholeso me curiosity and desire to investigate and<br>
learn. The whole camp approach is &quot;Let's go and find out.&quot;<br>
5. Learning how to properly balance work, play, rest, and alternate<br>
periods of vigorous activity with those less active; observing regular<br>
hours for rest and sleep.<br>
6. Education on the wise use of leisure time, choo sing activities that<br>
recreate rather than kill time. This fulfills one of society's greatest<br>
needs as leisure time increases and working hours decrease. Many of<br>
the out-of-doors camp activities (canoeing, swimming, hiking,<br>
boating, fishing, camping out, nature study, horseback riding)<br>
provide the interests and skills necessary to take advantage of our<br>
rapidly expanding parks and other recreatio nal facilities. Although<br>
football and basketball may be fine school sports, few will continue<br>
in them after school days are over.<br>
7. Learning to enjoy simple pastimes that don't cost a lot of money as<br>
well as learning to entertain oneself instead of relying on others or<br>
on canned entertainment.<br>
8. Developing appreciation for serious and thoughtful programs by<br>
participating in vespers, observing Sabbath, and enjoying campfire<br>
programs based on thought-provoking themes and rituals.<br>
Spirit of Prophecy quotations:<br>
&quot;Those vwho sacrifice simplicity to fashion, and shut them-selves away<br>
from the beauties of nature, cannot be spiritually minded. They cannot<br>
understand the skill and power of God as revealed in His created works;<br>
therefore their hearts do not quicken and throb with new love and<br>
interest, and they are not filled with awe and reverence as they see God<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
in nature&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 584).<br>
&quot;As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction<br>
into the mind. It is not the conviction that logical reasonings produces;<br>
but unless the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye too dim<br>
to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning is<br>
grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the written word are<br>
impressed on the heart&quot; (Christ's Objet Lessons, p. 24).<br>
&quot;Christ sharply reproved the men of His time because they had not<br>
learned from nature the spiritual lessons which they might have learned.<br>
All things, animate and inanimate, express to man the knowledge of<br>
God&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 580).<br>
&quot;The more quiet and simple the life of the child, – the more free<br>
from artificial excitement and the more in harmony with nature,<br>
the more favorable it is to physical and mental vigor and to spiritual<br>
strength&quot; (Education, p. 107).<br>
&quot;So far as possible, let the child from his earliest years be placed where<br>
this wonderful lesson-book [the book of nature] shall be open be fore<br>
him.... In no other way can the foundation of a true education be so<br>
firmly and surely laid&quot; (Education, p. 100-101).<br>
&quot;From His earliest years He [Jesus] was possessed of one purpose; He<br>
lived to bless others. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas<br>
of ways and means flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and<br>
animal life.<br>
He was trying to understand the reason of things. Heavenly<br>
beings were His attendants, and the culture of holy thoughts and<br>
communings was His. From the first dawning of intelligence He was<br>
constantly growing in spiritual grace and knowledge of truth.<br>
&quot;... Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did&quot; (Desire of Ages, p. 70).<br>
d. Spiritual Values in Camping<br>
Never in the history of the world has so much depended on the spiritual<br>
orientation of youth. And no group of peoplepreachers, teachers, or<br>
parents - has a greater opportunity to direct that orientation than the<br>
people who live with children and adolescents through camping<br>
experiences of the summer months. Lives have been changed in summer<br>
camps. No one goes through a camping experience without its leaving<br>
some mark upon his or her spirit. Whe ther you know it, whether you<br>
desire it, you are going to affect, for good or ill, the spiritual lives of the<br>
young people le vith whom you deal.<br>
In speaking of spiritual values in camping we are not<br>
teachings of any religious group – their doctrine or any form of<br>
worship-but rather with that which will lead us to an experience of<br>
orienting our souls toward God and to ward our fellow men.<br>
Test the spiritual values of your camp life.<br>
1, Closeness to nature<br>
dealing with the<br>
2. The Experience of harmony and order<br>
In camp you build your own shelter of na tive materials, and cook<br>
your own food over an open fire. As you do these things, you are<br>
close to nature and you come to know her as a friend. You climb<br>
hills, discover the treasures of the forest or meadow, make friends<br>
with trees, birds, animals, and even insects. Having this experience<br>
will call out a sense of wonder-the purest approach to the reality of<br>
God.<br>
135<br>
The tragedy of today's living is that we have lived so long in the<br>
presence of the distorted and the abnormal that we actually mistake<br>
abnormality for normality and distortion for real. Think of the world to<br>
which these campers of ours belonga world of blaring radios,<br>
television, gangster comics, torrid movies, wild music, and art without<br>
meaning. Then think of the world to which we are privileged to<br>
introduce them a world of balanced harmony in light and shade,<br>
color variety, trees, and mountains. And all have beauty just in being<br>
themselves.<br>
3. God's great creativeness<br>
If we are to cure the sickness of a maddened world, we must return to<br>
nature for the greatest lessons that God would have us learn. In our<br>
camping experience we come into the presence of God's design.<br>
As we finger clay, dabble with paint, or learn to weave, we do not set<br>
out just to imitate nature. There is within the human spirit that urge that<br>
makes us akin to God– the urge to create out of the deepest<br>
yearnings of our spirit.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
4. Adaptability<br>
Nature is inexorable. Rain falls in spite of our fond desires. But<br>
when we learn to live with nature, to adapt ourselves to her moods,<br>
we find that in every aspect she is beautiful. To a real camper the<br>
circumstances of life become a challenge, and in nature's every<br>
aspect appears the hand of God.<br>
5. Cooperative fellowship<br>
It is here that the camper will discover community. We are members of<br>
one another, and our world is going to disintegrate completely unless<br>
we recognize it. There is also discovered a democracy, the sharing of<br>
responsibility. Democracy also means a leveling process in which at<br>
times the camper may even be able to teach the counselor, and all<br>
artificial distinctions drop away.<br>
CASE STUDIES<br>
How would you solve these problems?<br>
Below are four situations typical of those that could develop in your camp<br>
or during other type of outdoor activities. After studying the case<br>
description, decide which of the statements following it would be the best<br>
solution, and place a check mark before it.<br>
Case One<br>
A counselor and his Path finders make plans for a short hike and<br>
cookout. They plan the menu and divide the responsibilities. At the<br>
campsite, Jerry and Ben go to get firewood while the other boys cook<br>
the meal and tend to their duties. In the space of a few minutes there is<br>
a scream and Ben yells for help. The counselor hurriedly makes his way<br>
to Ben and finds that Jerry has badly cut his leg with the axe. He<br>
administers first aid, and the unit makes its way home with the<br>
wounded boy, their fun spoiled by an accident. What would have been<br>
the best method of preventing this misfortune?<br>
Case Two<br>
The boys should not have been permitted to use the axe.<br>
2. The counselor should have accompanied the boys who<br>
were getting the wood.<br>
3. A project that would have been safer should have been<br>
planned.<br>
4. The boys should have been given better training in the<br>
use of the axe.<br>
The Pathfinder unit decides to go horseback riding with thir<br>
counselor, Anne. All of them have ridden horses before. Anne asks<br>
each of them to walk the horse whenever footing is unsure. All goes<br>
well until they start back to the stables. A short distance from the<br>
stables, on a rocky, downhill trail, Susie, who is riding at the head of<br>
the group, lets her horse break into a trot. The other Path finders follow<br>
Susie's example, but Anne who is the last rider, holds her horse to a<br>
walk and brings up the rear. When Anne arrives at the stables, she<br>
reprimands Susie and tells her she cannot ride with the group again. What<br>
would you have done?<br>
1. Ignored the incident, since no one was injured.<br>
136<br>
2. Ridden at the head of the group.<br>
3. Made the same decision that Anne made.<br>
4. Reprimanded all the Pathfinders and deprived<br>
them of future riding.<br>
Discussed the situation, explaining the reason for the<br>
safety precaution and warn that the infraction should not<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
Case Three<br>
Occur again.<br>
A Pathfinder Club is having an overnight camp out by the lake. When the<br>
campfire is over, a movement starts among the group to go for a<br>
moonlight swim.<br>
What should the counselor do?<br>
1. Tell them moonlight swimming is against the rules.<br>
Lecture the group on the dangers, then let them decide.<br>
3. Tell them you wish it were possible, but the hazards<br>
outweigh the pleasure.<br>
4. Say nothing, allow the group to swim, and do your best to<br>
ensure safety.<br>
Case Four<br>
Comments on case: In case three, a situation is presented in which on the<br>
impulse of the moment, Pathfinders suggest an activity having some<br>
grave safety problems. It should be assumed here that the leadership<br>
has decided that the dangers outweigh the advantages. It is a question<br>
of the Club director and staff bcing able to pres<br>
esent convincing and<br>
sound reasons for refusing the request. It would also be wise to<br>
substitute some other safe activity in place of the moonlight swim. It is<br>
a case in which the staff should carefully canvas the possibilities and<br>
anticipate such a tum of events, getting the group to agree to a program that<br>
John is the counselor of a unit that has asked for an overnight hike, which will<br>
mean the preparation of two meals out-of-doors. Although most of the<br>
members have been on similar trips before, John does not feel that he is<br>
qualified to lead his group on the proposed trip.<br>
What should he do?<br>
1. Aska more experienced counselor in campcraft to accompany him<br>
and his group?<br>
2. Persuade his unit to take a less extensive trip that he is more<br>
capable of leading?<br>
3. Refuse to consider the trip?<br>
_4. Go with the group and learn as he goes?<br>
Comments on Case: Counselors need to have had experience in outdoor skills<br>
before leading a unit. In this case, John is unfortunate to have been caught in a<br>
situation in which he feels unquali fied to lead his group on a proposed trip. A<br>
counselor's influence with his group is enhanced when he demonstrates skills<br>
that are applauded by the group. It would be well for him to go out into his<br>
138<br>
own backyard and cook a meal or two, and then go with the group and learn<br>
as he goes.<br>
did not include a oonlight swim.<br>

Planning a Camp<br>
In Pathfinder Clubs, camping and outdoor activities are a necessity and are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind.<br>
It is our aim to give you a sample of what is required of each leader in<br>
planning a campout. These suggestions will prove beneficial to all who<br>
plan and those who participate, making your camp not only successful<br>

As leaders, you may think the above suggestions are too organized, but<br>
remember that young people like to be active; if they are not active they<br>
will get into mischief. Also remember that Satan finds something for idle<br>
hands to do.<br>

Guidelines for a Good Campout<br>
1. General rules for running the campout<br>
a, Insist on absolute consideration for the other person, As a result there<br>
will be no practical jokes, the person and property of each will be out<br>
of bounds for all others; all camp chores will be shared; the nights will<br>
be quiet; sanitation and personal cleanliness are a must. Tents are not<br>
disturbed.<br>
b. Everyone will take part in all the activities, including discussions,<br>
worship, instruction, and practical learning. Teaming up is half the fun.<br>
C. Be sure that all campers and staff recognize that God is camped with<br>
us. This will show in our words and attitudes. Any Sabbath kept during<br>
the campout will show our loyalty to God. We will all join in thoughtful<br>
worship, morning and evening. The natural surro undings will be cared<br>
for as His contribution to our pleasure.<br>
2. What to bring<br>
a. Hiking clothes, including boots and rain gear, suitable to enjoy<br>
water, mud, sun, rain, without worry of ruining them<br>
b. Change of clothing for night wear or emergency; including an extra<br>
warm sweater<br>
c. Food as listed, eating and cooking gear, cleaning up needs<br>
d. Sleeping bag, ground cover, compass, flashlight (able to throwa<br>
good beam for several hours)<br>
e. Bible, pamphlet, notebook, ball point pen, personal First-aid kit<br>
f. Personal cleanliness needs, including toilet paper<br>
g. Humor, patience, helpfulness, determination to make it a good<br>
trip for all<br>
3. Cooking arrangements<br>
a. Most easily done on a portable stove that may be used in a tent or<br>
under wet conditions.<br>
b. Cook in pairs, sharing some utensils but campers should pack own<br>
food supplies<br>
4. On the go<br>
a. Time your hiking to arrive at suitable campsites (water, shelter, level<br>
ground) by Haismi th's Rule.<br>
Easy going<br>
Easy scrambling<br>
Rough country, deep sand,<br>
soft snow, thick bush<br>
4.8 km/hr (3 mph/hr)<br>
3 km/hr (2 mph/hr)<br>
141<br>
1.6 km/hr (1 mph/hr)<br>
For every hour over five hours allow one hour for fatigue. For<br>
very fit and experienced walkers reduce time by one-third.<br>
b. Train yourself mentally and physically to enjoy all types of weather and<br>
terrain. Practice coping safely with night walking, river crossing,<br>
exposure conditions, vertical dimbs, and sleeping on the ground. Learn<br>
all you can from experienced hikers.<br>
C. Keep a clear personal log, making your own map and compass<br>
readings to be responsible for your own safety. Do your own<br>
mapping where neces sary. If conditions limit accuracy, state<br>
approximately how accurate your information is.<br>
d. Fill in log books in huts you pass to facilitate any Search and<br>
Rescue operation, should such be necessary.<br>
e. Notice the thrill of overcoming the unreasonable dislike of<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
f. Get used to the weight of boots, the feel of wool next to the skin,<br>
the full pack on your back, and the sense of responsibility that<br>
goes with such freedom.<br>
g. Develop the attitude that you are an invited visitor into God's world.<br>
He made it for you. Enjoy it!<br>
5. When you come back<br>
discomfort, wet clothes, muddy skins, darkness, solitude. You're<br>
tougher than you think.<br>
a. Sort out your pack into:<br>
C.<br>
b. Next time look after the ounces (grams) and the pounds<br>
(kilos) will look after themselves.<br>
(1) What you actually used<br>
FOOD<br>
(2) What you could use from your observations<br>
(3) What you now know you'll never use (discard it)<br>
d. The benefits of such an experience will be felt long after the scars<br>
have healed!<br>
Be thankful.<br>

Country Code<br>
When on a hike, participants should observe the following<br>
&quot;Country Code.&quot;<br>
1. Contact the local police station if undertaking an expedition in<br>
unpopulated areas or for a lengthy period of time.<br>
2. Guard against all risks of fire. Check on fire bans with local<br>
police.<br>
3. Leave gates the same way you found them.<br>
4. Keep dogs and/or horses under proper control.<br>
5. Leave no litter. What goes out full can return empty.<br>
6. Avoid damaging fences, gates, etc.<br>
7. Ask permission to use private property BEFORE the<br>
expedition.<br>
8. Check and safeguard water supplies.<br>
9. Travel carefully on country roads.<br>
10. Protect wildlife, plants, and trees.<br>
11. Respect life of the countryside.<br>
NOTE: Permission must be obtained from the owner BEFORE<br>
the expedition to camp on private property.<br>

                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
3. Types of Camping<br>
Let's look now at two basic types of camping.<br>
a. Site camps<br>
b. Trave ling camps<br>
It is said, &quot;Variety is the spice of life.&quot; While this is not always true, it is<br>
fairly true of camping. To do the same thing over and over becomes<br>
monotonous and boring. Path finders, while they enjoy camping and will<br>
stick with the program, like adventure, challenge, and development of new<br>
skills. This is especially applicable to the older age group. The harder the<br>
challenge the more enjoyment they seem to get, especially when the<br>
challenge can be accomplished. It is damaging to set before a young person<br>
a goal that you know cannot be achieved. Always set realistic goals.<br>
&quot;Static&quot;<br>
The goals you set are determined by the type of camp you have. If you plan<br>
to teach your group abseiling or rappeling, then don't wear them out by<br>
having hiking, biking, canoeing, or other types of physically exhausting<br>
camps. Plan to concentrate your efforts in both theory and practice on<br>
achieving the goal. A site camp would be preferable for this goal, with<br>
transport readily available in an emergency. Try to achieve ONE major goal<br>
in a campout with subsidiary goals that point to the major goal.<br>
Remember that your site must be che cked out beforehand so that the goal<br>
you hope to achieve will be realized. Goals determine the site.<br>
Don't always find a nice site then work your campouts around that site.<br>
Good sites are hard to come by and it is easy to plan a camp once you have<br>
a site, but invariably you will find that the type of camp you offer will<br>
become stereotyped. This is all right for a new Club or for new Pathfinders,<br>
but it is not satisfactory for older members or for you as a leader to<br>
continue to do this. Both your older Pathfinders and your own initiative will<br>
soon be in a rut and the excitement of new horizons will become lost. Have<br>
you ever wondered, &quot;Why do kids enjoy camping so much when it seems<br>
such a lot of hard work and inconvenience?&quot; It just might be that you are<br>
already experiencing this syndrome. Plan to do something exciting,<br>
something different, and your enthusiasm will challenge the older Path-<br>
finders.<br>
a. Site Camp<br>
Let us list some of the types of camps that you could organize.<br>
It is good to have at least one each year. A site camp is simply a camp to<br>
which you drive your vehicles, erect your tents, camp at the samne place,<br>
then drive home at the conclusion of the camp. All activities focus<br>
around the site.<br>
These campouts are really good in that they help you to achieve a<br>
whole variety of things such as:<br>
Pathfinder classwork<br>
Swimming Honors<br>
Rock Climbing<br>
Hiking<br>
Fire building<br>
...20 (min.)<br>
Nature Honors<br>
(trees, ferns, flowers, etc.)<br>
Signaling<br>
Camperaft Honors<br>
Bible camps<br>
Axemanship<br>
Track and trail<br>
Lashings/knots<br>
Fire Building<br>
Orienteering<br>
146<br>
Make sure that there is a purpose to each campout you have, and that<br>
people are there with sufficient knowledge in particular areas to help<br>
you realize that purpose. Don't make your goal &quot;to have a good time.&quot;<br>
This must be a by-product of your camp, rather than an end in itself.<br>
Meeting new challenges, seeing new horizons, and developing new skills<br>
(which is cducation) providcs advcnturc that will cnsurc that cverybody<br>
has a good time. The balance betwveen what is done in 1) the theoretical<br>
way, and 2) a practical way, will largely determine the &quot;great time&quot; that<br>
was had.<br>
Don't overburden with theory, but make sure that sufficient has been<br>
learned to avoid pitfalls. They say &quot;a fool learns by his own mistakes<br>
but a wise man learns from the mistakes of fools.&quot;<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
b. Traveling Camps<br>
These camps move from one location to another and are designed to<br>
bring out initiative, reso urcefulness, courage, strength, and ability while<br>
putting into practice the things a Pathfinder has learned. Site camps can<br>
do this, too, but there is a challenge and a sense of achievement and<br>
adventure that can be gained on a traveling campout that cannot be<br>
achieved on a site campout. A Pathfinder has to learn to depend on his<br>
or her physical well being, knowledge and equipment to a far greater<br>
capacity, and in all these things sees the hand of God more clearly<br>
revealed. When you are halfway between point A and B, and are<br>
exhausted and feel that one more step will be your last, it is then that :<br>
person realizes his or her extremity and reaches out for help. At the<br>
conclusion of the campout that person has achieved the seemingly<br>
impossible but is determined to be more physically fit, have better<br>
equipment, and know more of what is to be done the next time.<br>
It is important to encourage the ones who drift to the rear and slow<br>
those who race to the front. The first hour or two will usually indicate<br>
what the general pattern will be, and it is important to check it before it<br>
gets out of control. It is wise to make an announcement that &quot;someone<br>
(who knows the way) will lead and &quot;'someone will bring up the rear. All<br>
Pathfinders must then be contained between these two leaders. This<br>
must be strictly enforced for the first day or two, depending on how long<br>
the group is going to travel. Nothing is more psychologically devastating<br>
to a traveling camper than to be always at the end of the line, and who<br>
knows what trouble they could be in if left to struggle while everyone<br>
else tears ahead. Sometimes these campers need to be put to the front.<br>
It is amazing how much faster they travel when they take the lead. It is<br>
not wise to scold, for that will cause even more disco uragement. It is<br>
better to play psychological games with everyone, thus encouraging all<br>
to be more helpful.<br>
The person who consistently barges ahead in the lead must be held back. He<br>
or she can get into all sorts of difficulty, and may be involved in an<br>
accident or get lost by such foolhardiness. That person also needs<br>
encouragement in being helpful to the group. Maybe he or she could carry a<br>
bit of extra weight from the slower ones or help the slower ones by walking<br>
with them and thus encouraging them or ministering to their needs.<br>
Whatever happens, it is essential that the group be contained and move<br>
forward as a group.<br>
It is important that all equipment taken on a travel campout be of good<br>
quality. Repairs along the way often make the poor quality article worse.<br>
Sometimes something can be rendered irreparable on the first day and<br>
you are then stuck without<br>
                                                      <br>

b. Benefits to the Individual (20 min.)<br>
In this section we emphasize the importance of camping and outdoor<br>
education in the Pathfinder program. It must be emphasized that we are<br>
only discussing basic aspects in this session-the real learning takes place<br>
in the outdoors.<br>
                                                      <br>
Outdoor living holds a tremendous potential in spiritual values and character-building elements. Campcraft offers great opportunity for practicing democratic group procedures; for building self-reliance, resourcefulness, self-discipline, and respect for other people; for practical application of nature lore and for its greatest appreciation; and best of all – Pathfinders like it. It is therefore recommended that, outdoor living with its multi-skilled requirements compose a large segment of the year's Pathfinder program.<br>
                                                      <br>
This is especially true when one considers that familiarity with the<br>
wilderness may be a great asset in the days to come. The experience that<br>
is gained through fellowship in camping and the skills developed in<br>
outdoor survival will be very helpful to God's people in the time of<br>
trouble.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. A perception of nature's blueprint for and interdependent upon of things.<br>
In this age of artificial amusements and synthetic excitement, we<br>
should turn to outdoor recreation. God counsels in Messages to Young<br>
People, pages 380, 381 &quot;There are modes of recreation which are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind. An enlightened,<br>
discrimina ting mind will find abundant means for entertainment and<br>
diversion, from sources not only innocent, but instructive. Recreation<br>
in the open air, the contemplation of the works of God in nature,<br>
will be of the highest benefit.&quot;<br>
Camping provides many opportunities for individual and group<br>
development. Let us discuss these under two headings: Benefits to<br>
the Individual and The Camper's Lifestyle.<br>
                                                      <br>
1. An intimate knowledge of nature with a love for all her facets which<br>
will never leave and will constantly bring back nostalgic memories<br>
and a longing to be outdoors again.<br>
a each other andg all things in balance<br>
one's place in the scheme<br>
                                                      <br>
3. A meaningful spiritual awakening that reveals God's presence and<br>
touch in everything as the camper views the majesty of a high<br>
mountain, the peace of a quiet valley, the glory of a colorful sunset,<br>
the glint of sun-light on the lake, or dewdrops glistening on an<br>
intricate spider web.<br>
                                                      <br>
4. An understanding of the true meaning of conserving natural<br>
resources and the reasons that immediate action is necessary if we<br>
are to save any of the little that remains after so many years of<br>
neglect and destruction by our affluent society, which has<br>
assumed that the supply of natural resources is inexhaustible.<br>
                                                      <br>
5. A new self-respect and self-confidence as one learns to manage for<br>
oneself and do things others may previously have done for him or her.<br>
Others are too busy with their own jobs to pamper or pick up after<br>
another campe.<br>
                                                      <br>
6. A pride in one's ability to improvise and make do with what is available.<br>
At camp the Pathfinder cannot run to the store to replace something<br>
damaged or satisfy the whim of the moment.<br>
                                                      <br>
7. A feeling of at-homeness in the out-of-doors as one learns to use<br>
natural materials, selecting and preparing those best suited to his or her<br>
needs with such simple tools as an axe, knife, or saw.<br>
                                                      <br>
8. A respect for the dignity of work and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
sweating and struggling to cook over a smoky fire, construct a lean-to<br>
shelter, or build a bridge across a stream.<br>
                                                      <br>
9. Pride in good health and physical fitness that vigorous outdoor life<br>
brings as it stimulates the camper's lungs and heart, exercises muscles,<br>
and produces an appetite for the simple, nutritious meals cooked out-<br>
doors or planned and served indoors.<br>
                                                      <br>
10. A new and more realistic sense of values as one notes how unimportant<br>
such things as money, material possessions, IQ, and fine clothes are in<br>
assessing the true worth of an individual. In camp one finds that the<br>
happiest, best liked, and most respected counselors and campers have<br>
spurned outward appearances and material possessions.<br>
                                                      <br>
11. A feeling of community, pride, and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
serving others, as one maintains the campsite for the benefit of present<br>
and future campers.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <em>c. Benefits of Camping Activities</em><br>
1. Developing lifetime hobbies and sometimes a vocation. Experience in a<br>
wide variety of activities discloses the canper's interests as well as<br>
aptitudes and broadens his or her perspectives, building unders tanding<br>
and appreciation for the interests of others. Camping aims to develop all-<br>
around abilities rather than specialization in a few, as is so often done in<br>
school sports and other activities in which only a few are chosen to<br>
participate while the majority remain on the sidelines to cheer.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. Encourages one to try to improve one's own performance. Although<br>
there is enough competition to give those with superior ability a<br>
chance to shine, most of the emphasis is on self-improvement. This<br>
is preferable to the situation in a highly competitive program where<br>
a few nearly always do well and may beconme smug and conceited,<br>
while others are usually well down the scale, become dejected, and<br>
have a &quot; don't care&quot; attitude.<br>
3. Having just plain fun as well as the excitement and new experiences<br>
every normal child craves but doing it in a wholly safe and sane way.<br>
Youngsters who can find the ir thrills this way will never &quot;need&quot; to<br>
resort to stealing, fighting, or killing just for &quot;kicks.&quot;<br>
4. Developing a wholeso me curiosity and desire to investigate and<br>
learn. The whole camp approach is &quot;Let's go and find out.&quot;<br>
5. Learning how to properly balance work, play, rest, and alternate<br>
periods of vigorous activity with those less active; observing regular<br>
hours for rest and sleep.<br>
6. Education on the wise use of leisure time, choo sing activities that<br>
recreate rather than kill time. This fulfills one of society's greatest<br>
needs as leisure time increases and working hours decrease. Many of<br>
the out-of-doors camp activities (canoeing, swimming, hiking,<br>
boating, fishing, camping out, nature study, horseback riding)<br>
provide the interests and skills necessary to take advantage of our<br>
rapidly expanding parks and other recreatio nal facilities. Although<br>
football and basketball may be fine school sports, few will continue<br>
in them after school days are over.<br>
7. Learning to enjoy simple pastimes that don't cost a lot of money as<br>
well as learning to entertain oneself instead of relying on others or<br>
on canned entertainment.<br>
8. Developing appreciation for serious and thoughtful programs by<br>
participating in vespers, observing Sabbath, and enjoying campfire<br>
programs based on thought-provoking themes and rituals.<br>
Spirit of Prophecy quotations:<br>
&quot;Those vwho sacrifice simplicity to fashion, and shut them-selves away<br>
from the beauties of nature, cannot be spiritually minded. They cannot<br>
understand the skill and power of God as revealed in His created works;<br>
therefore their hearts do not quicken and throb with new love and<br>
interest, and they are not filled with awe and reverence as they see God<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
in nature&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 584).<br>
&quot;As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction<br>
into the mind. It is not the conviction that logical reasonings produces;<br>
but unless the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye too dim<br>
to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning is<br>
grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the written word are<br>
impressed on the heart&quot; (Christ's Objet Lessons, p. 24).<br>
&quot;Christ sharply reproved the men of His time because they had not<br>
learned from nature the spiritual lessons which they might have learned.<br>
All things, animate and inanimate, express to man the knowledge of<br>
God&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 580).<br>
&quot;The more quiet and simple the life of the child, – the more free<br>
from artificial excitement and the more in harmony with nature,<br>
the more favorable it is to physical and mental vigor and to spiritual<br>
strength&quot; (Education, p. 107).<br>
&quot;So far as possible, let the child from his earliest years be placed where<br>
this wonderful lesson-book [the book of nature] shall be open be fore<br>
him.... In no other way can the foundation of a true education be so<br>
firmly and surely laid&quot; (Education, p. 100-101).<br>
&quot;From His earliest years He [Jesus] was possessed of one purpose; He<br>
lived to bless others. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas<br>
of ways and means flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and<br>
animal life.<br>
He was trying to understand the reason of things. Heavenly<br>
beings were His attendants, and the culture of holy thoughts and<br>
communings was His. From the first dawning of intelligence He was<br>
constantly growing in spiritual grace and knowledge of truth.<br>
&quot;... Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did&quot; (Desire of Ages, p. 70).<br>
d. Spiritual Values in Camping<br>
Never in the history of the world has so much depended on the spiritual<br>
orientation of youth. And no group of peoplepreachers, teachers, or<br>
parents - has a greater opportunity to direct that orientation than the<br>
people who live with children and adolescents through camping<br>
experiences of the summer months. Lives have been changed in summer<br>
camps. No one goes through a camping experience without its leaving<br>
some mark upon his or her spirit. Whe ther you know it, whether you<br>
desire it, you are going to affect, for good or ill, the spiritual lives of the<br>
young people le vith whom you deal.<br>
In speaking of spiritual values in camping we are not<br>
teachings of any religious group – their doctrine or any form of<br>
worship-but rather with that which will lead us to an experience of<br>
orienting our souls toward God and to ward our fellow men.<br>
Test the spiritual values of your camp life.<br>
1, Closeness to nature<br>
dealing with the<br>
2. The Experience of harmony and order<br>
In camp you build your own shelter of na tive materials, and cook<br>
your own food over an open fire. As you do these things, you are<br>
close to nature and you come to know her as a friend. You climb<br>
hills, discover the treasures of the forest or meadow, make friends<br>
with trees, birds, animals, and even insects. Having this experience<br>
will call out a sense of wonder-the purest approach to the reality of<br>
God.<br>
135<br>
The tragedy of today's living is that we have lived so long in the<br>
presence of the distorted and the abnormal that we actually mistake<br>
abnormality for normality and distortion for real. Think of the world to<br>
which these campers of ours belonga world of blaring radios,<br>
television, gangster comics, torrid movies, wild music, and art without<br>
meaning. Then think of the world to which we are privileged to<br>
introduce them a world of balanced harmony in light and shade,<br>
color variety, trees, and mountains. And all have beauty just in being<br>
themselves.<br>
3. God's great creativeness<br>
If we are to cure the sickness of a maddened world, we must return to<br>
nature for the greatest lessons that God would have us learn. In our<br>
camping experience we come into the presence of God's design.<br>
As we finger clay, dabble with paint, or learn to weave, we do not set<br>
out just to imitate nature. There is within the human spirit that urge that<br>
makes us akin to God– the urge to create out of the deepest<br>
yearnings of our spirit.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
4. Adaptability<br>
Nature is inexorable. Rain falls in spite of our fond desires. But<br>
when we learn to live with nature, to adapt ourselves to her moods,<br>
we find that in every aspect she is beautiful. To a real camper the<br>
circumstances of life become a challenge, and in nature's every<br>
aspect appears the hand of God.<br>
5. Cooperative fellowship<br>
It is here that the camper will discover community. We are members of<br>
one another, and our world is going to disintegrate completely unless<br>
we recognize it. There is also discovered a democracy, the sharing of<br>
responsibility. Democracy also means a leveling process in which at<br>
times the camper may even be able to teach the counselor, and all<br>
artificial distinctions drop away.<br>
CASE STUDIES<br>
How would you solve these problems?<br>
Below are four situations typical of those that could develop in your camp<br>
or during other type of outdoor activities. After studying the case<br>
description, decide which of the statements following it would be the best<br>
solution, and place a check mark before it.<br>
Case One<br>
A counselor and his Path finders make plans for a short hike and<br>
cookout. They plan the menu and divide the responsibilities. At the<br>
campsite, Jerry and Ben go to get firewood while the other boys cook<br>
the meal and tend to their duties. In the space of a few minutes there is<br>
a scream and Ben yells for help. The counselor hurriedly makes his way<br>
to Ben and finds that Jerry has badly cut his leg with the axe. He<br>
administers first aid, and the unit makes its way home with the<br>
wounded boy, their fun spoiled by an accident. What would have been<br>
the best method of preventing this misfortune?<br>
Case Two<br>
The boys should not have been permitted to use the axe.<br>
2. The counselor should have accompanied the boys who<br>
were getting the wood.<br>
3. A project that would have been safer should have been<br>
planned.<br>
4. The boys should have been given better training in the<br>
use of the axe.<br>
The Pathfinder unit decides to go horseback riding with thir<br>
counselor, Anne. All of them have ridden horses before. Anne asks<br>
each of them to walk the horse whenever footing is unsure. All goes<br>
well until they start back to the stables. A short distance from the<br>
stables, on a rocky, downhill trail, Susie, who is riding at the head of<br>
the group, lets her horse break into a trot. The other Path finders follow<br>
Susie's example, but Anne who is the last rider, holds her horse to a<br>
walk and brings up the rear. When Anne arrives at the stables, she<br>
reprimands Susie and tells her she cannot ride with the group again. What<br>
would you have done?<br>
1. Ignored the incident, since no one was injured.<br>
136<br>
2. Ridden at the head of the group.<br>
3. Made the same decision that Anne made.<br>
4. Reprimanded all the Pathfinders and deprived<br>
them of future riding.<br>
Discussed the situation, explaining the reason for the<br>
safety precaution and warn that the infraction should not<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
Case Three<br>
Occur again.<br>
A Pathfinder Club is having an overnight camp out by the lake. When the<br>
campfire is over, a movement starts among the group to go for a<br>
moonlight swim.<br>
What should the counselor do?<br>
1. Tell them moonlight swimming is against the rules.<br>
Lecture the group on the dangers, then let them decide.<br>
3. Tell them you wish it were possible, but the hazards<br>
outweigh the pleasure.<br>
4. Say nothing, allow the group to swim, and do your best to<br>
ensure safety.<br>
Case Four<br>
Comments on case: In case three, a situation is presented in which on the<br>
impulse of the moment, Pathfinders suggest an activity having some<br>
grave safety problems. It should be assumed here that the leadership<br>
has decided that the dangers outweigh the advantages. It is a question<br>
of the Club director and staff bcing able to pres<br>
esent convincing and<br>
sound reasons for refusing the request. It would also be wise to<br>
substitute some other safe activity in place of the moonlight swim. It is<br>
a case in which the staff should carefully canvas the possibilities and<br>
anticipate such a tum of events, getting the group to agree to a program that<br>
John is the counselor of a unit that has asked for an overnight hike, which will<br>
mean the preparation of two meals out-of-doors. Although most of the<br>
members have been on similar trips before, John does not feel that he is<br>
qualified to lead his group on the proposed trip.<br>
What should he do?<br>
1. Aska more experienced counselor in campcraft to accompany him<br>
and his group?<br>
2. Persuade his unit to take a less extensive trip that he is more<br>
capable of leading?<br>
3. Refuse to consider the trip?<br>
_4. Go with the group and learn as he goes?<br>
Comments on Case: Counselors need to have had experience in outdoor skills<br>
before leading a unit. In this case, John is unfortunate to have been caught in a<br>
situation in which he feels unquali fied to lead his group on a proposed trip. A<br>
counselor's influence with his group is enhanced when he demonstrates skills<br>
that are applauded by the group. It would be well for him to go out into his<br>
138<br>
own backyard and cook a meal or two, and then go with the group and learn<br>
as he goes.<br>
did not include a oonlight swim.<br>

Planning a Camp<br>
In Pathfinder Clubs, camping and outdoor activities are a necessity and are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind.<br>
It is our aim to give you a sample of what is required of each leader in<br>
planning a campout. These suggestions will prove beneficial to all who<br>
plan and those who participate, making your camp not only successful<br>
but enjoyable.<br>

As leaders, you may think the above suggestions are too organized, but<br>
remember that young people like to be active; if they are not active they<br>
will get into mischief. Also remember that Satan finds something for idle<br>
hands to do.<br>

Guidelines for a Good Campout<br>
1. General rules for running the campout<br>
a, Insist on absolute consideration for the other person, As a result there<br>
will be no practical jokes, the person and property of each will be out<br>
of bounds for all others; all camp chores will be shared; the nights will<br>
be quiet; sanitation and personal cleanliness are a must. Tents are not<br>
disturbed.<br>
b. Everyone will take part in all the activities, including discussions,<br>
worship, instruction, and practical learning. Teaming up is half the fun.<br>
C. Be sure that all campers and staff recognize that God is camped with<br>
us. This will show in our words and attitudes. Any Sabbath kept during<br>
the campout will show our loyalty to God. We will all join in thoughtful<br>
worship, morning and evening. The natural surro undings will be cared<br>
for as His contribution to our pleasure.<br>
2. What to bring<br>
a. Hiking clothes, including boots and rain gear, suitable to enjoy<br>
water, mud, sun, rain, without worry of ruining them<br>
b. Change of clothing for night wear or emergency; including an extra<br>
warm sweater<br>
c. Food as listed, eating and cooking gear, cleaning up needs<br>
d. Sleeping bag, ground cover, compass, flashlight (able to throwa<br>
good beam for several hours)<br>
e. Bible, pamphlet, notebook, ball point pen, personal First-aid kit<br>
f. Personal cleanliness needs, including toilet paper<br>
g. Humor, patience, helpfulness, determination to make it a good<br>
trip for all<br>
3. Cooking arrangements<br>
a. Most easily done on a portable stove that may be used in a tent or<br>
under wet conditions.<br>
b. Cook in pairs, sharing some utensils but campers should pack own<br>
food supplies<br>
4. On the go<br>
a. Time your hiking to arrive at suitable campsites (water, shelter, level<br>
ground) by Haismi th's Rule.<br>
Easy going<br>
Easy scrambling<br>
Rough country, deep sand,<br>
soft snow, thick bush<br>
4.8 km/hr (3 mph/hr)<br>
3 km/hr (2 mph/hr)<br>
141<br>
1.6 km/hr (1 mph/hr)<br>
For every hour over five hours allow one hour for fatigue. For<br>
very fit and experienced walkers reduce time by one-third.<br>
b. Train yourself mentally and physically to enjoy all types of weather and<br>
terrain. Practice coping safely with night walking, river crossing,<br>
exposure conditions, vertical dimbs, and sleeping on the ground. Learn<br>
all you can from experienced hikers.<br>
C. Keep a clear personal log, making your own map and compass<br>
readings to be responsible for your own safety. Do your own<br>
mapping where neces sary. If conditions limit accuracy, state<br>
approximately how accurate your information is.<br>
d. Fill in log books in huts you pass to facilitate any Search and<br>
Rescue operation, should such be necessary.<br>
e. Notice the thrill of overcoming the unreasonable dislike of<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
f. Get used to the weight of boots, the feel of wool next to the skin,<br>
the full pack on your back, and the sense of responsibility that<br>
goes with such freedom.<br>
g. Develop the attitude that you are an invited visitor into God's world.<br>
He made it for you. Enjoy it!<br>
5. When you come back<br>
discomfort, wet clothes, muddy skins, darkness, solitude. You're<br>
tougher than you think.<br>
a. Sort out your pack into:<br>
C.<br>
b. Next time look after the ounces (grams) and the pounds<br>
(kilos) will look after themselves.<br>
(1) What you actually used<br>
FOOD<br>
(2) What you could use from your observations<br>
(3) What you now know you'll never use (discard it)<br>
d. The benefits of such an experience will be felt long after the scars<br>
have healed!<br>
Be thankful.<br>

Country Code<br>
When on a hike, participants should observe the following<br>
&quot;Country Code.&quot;<br>
1. Contact the local police station if undertaking an expedition in<br>
unpopulated areas or for a lengthy period of time.<br>
2. Guard against all risks of fire. Check on fire bans with local<br>
police.<br>
3. Leave gates the same way you found them.<br>
4. Keep dogs and/or horses under proper control.<br>
5. Leave no litter. What goes out full can return empty.<br>
6. Avoid damaging fences, gates, etc.<br>
7. Ask permission to use private property BEFORE the<br>
expedition.<br>
8. Check and safeguard water supplies.<br>
9. Travel carefully on country roads.<br>
10. Protect wildlife, plants, and trees.<br>
11. Respect life of the countryside.<br>
NOTE: Permission must be obtained from the owner BEFORE<br>
the expedition to camp on private property.<br>

will take nothing but photographs. I will leave nothing but<br>
footprints.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
3. Types of Camping<br>
Let's look now at two basic types of camping.<br>
a. Site camps<br>
b. Trave ling camps<br>
It is said, &quot;Variety is the spice of life.&quot; While this is not always true, it is<br>
fairly true of camping. To do the same thing over and over becomes<br>
monotonous and boring. Path finders, while they enjoy camping and will<br>
stick with the program, like adventure, challenge, and development of new<br>
skills. This is especially applicable to the older age group. The harder the<br>
challenge the more enjoyment they seem to get, especially when the<br>
challenge can be accomplished. It is damaging to set before a young person<br>
a goal that you know cannot be achieved. Always set realistic goals.<br>
&quot;Static&quot;<br>
The goals you set are determined by the type of camp you have. If you plan<br>
to teach your group abseiling or rappeling, then don't wear them out by<br>
having hiking, biking, canoeing, or other types of physically exhausting<br>
camps. Plan to concentrate your efforts in both theory and practice on<br>
achieving the goal. A site camp would be preferable for this goal, with<br>
transport readily available in an emergency. Try to achieve ONE major goal<br>
in a campout with subsidiary goals that point to the major goal.<br>
Remember that your site must be che cked out beforehand so that the goal<br>
you hope to achieve will be realized. Goals determine the site.<br>
Don't always find a nice site then work your campouts around that site.<br>
Good sites are hard to come by and it is easy to plan a camp once you have<br>
a site, but invariably you will find that the type of camp you offer will<br>
become stereotyped. This is all right for a new Club or for new Pathfinders,<br>
but it is not satisfactory for older members or for you as a leader to<br>
continue to do this. Both your older Pathfinders and your own initiative will<br>
soon be in a rut and the excitement of new horizons will become lost. Have<br>
you ever wondered, &quot;Why do kids enjoy camping so much when it seems<br>
such a lot of hard work and inconvenience?&quot; It just might be that you are<br>
already experiencing this syndrome. Plan to do something exciting,<br>
something different, and your enthusiasm will challenge the older Path-<br>
finders.<br>
a. Site Camp<br>
Let us list some of the types of camps that you could organize.<br>
It is good to have at least one each year. A site camp is simply a camp to<br>
which you drive your vehicles, erect your tents, camp at the samne place,<br>
then drive home at the conclusion of the camp. All activities focus<br>
around the site.<br>
These campouts are really good in that they help you to achieve a<br>
whole variety of things such as:<br>
Pathfinder classwork<br>
Swimming Honors<br>
Rock Climbing<br>
Hiking<br>
Fire building<br>
...20 (min.)<br>
Nature Honors<br>
(trees, ferns, flowers, etc.)<br>
Signaling<br>
Camperaft Honors<br>
Bible camps<br>
Axemanship<br>
Track and trail<br>
Lashings/knots<br>
Fire Building<br>
Orienteering<br>
146<br>
Make sure that there is a purpose to each campout you have, and that<br>
people are there with sufficient knowledge in particular areas to help<br>
you realize that purpose. Don't make your goal &quot;to have a good time.&quot;<br>
This must be a by-product of your camp, rather than an end in itself.<br>
Meeting new challenges, seeing new horizons, and developing new skills<br>
(which is cducation) providcs advcnturc that will cnsurc that cverybody<br>
has a good time. The balance betwveen what is done in 1) the theoretical<br>
way, and 2) a practical way, will largely determine the &quot;great time&quot; that<br>
was had.<br>
Don't overburden with theory, but make sure that sufficient has been<br>
learned to avoid pitfalls. They say &quot;a fool learns by his own mistakes<br>
but a wise man learns from the mistakes of fools.&quot;<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
b. Traveling Camps<br>
These camps move from one location to another and are designed to<br>
bring out initiative, reso urcefulness, courage, strength, and ability while<br>
putting into practice the things a Pathfinder has learned. Site camps can<br>
do this, too, but there is a challenge and a sense of achievement and<br>
adventure that can be gained on a traveling campout that cannot be<br>
achieved on a site campout. A Pathfinder has to learn to depend on his<br>
or her physical well being, knowledge and equipment to a far greater<br>
capacity, and in all these things sees the hand of God more clearly<br>
revealed. When you are halfway between point A and B, and are<br>
exhausted and feel that one more step will be your last, it is then that :<br>
person realizes his or her extremity and reaches out for help. At the<br>
conclusion of the campout that person has achieved the seemingly<br>
impossible but is determined to be more physically fit, have better<br>
equipment, and know more of what is to be done the next time.<br>
It is important to encourage the ones who drift to the rear and slow<br>
those who race to the front. The first hour or two will usually indicate<br>
what the general pattern will be, and it is important to check it before it<br>
gets out of control. It is wise to make an announcement that &quot;someone<br>
(who knows the way) will lead and &quot;'someone will bring up the rear. All<br>
Pathfinders must then be contained between these two leaders. This<br>
must be strictly enforced for the first day or two, depending on how long<br>
the group is going to travel. Nothing is more psychologically devastating<br>
to a traveling camper than to be always at the end of the line, and who<br>
knows what trouble they could be in if left to struggle while everyone<br>
else tears ahead. Sometimes these campers need to be put to the front.<br>
It is amazing how much faster they travel when they take the lead. It is<br>
not wise to scold, for that will cause even more disco uragement. It is<br>
better to play psychological games with everyone, thus encouraging all<br>
to be more helpful.<br>
The person who consistently barges ahead in the lead must be held back. He<br>
or she can get into all sorts of difficulty, and may be involved in an<br>
accident or get lost by such foolhardiness. That person also needs<br>
encouragement in being helpful to the group. Maybe he or she could carry a<br>
bit of extra weight from the slower ones or help the slower ones by walking<br>
with them and thus encouraging them or ministering to their needs.<br>
Whatever happens, it is essential that the group be contained and move<br>
forward as a group.<br>
It is important that all equipment taken on a travel campout be of good<br>
quality. Repairs along the way often make the poor quality article worse.<br>
Sometimes something can be rendered irreparable on the first day and<br>
you are then stuck without<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#FF69B4;">Lesson 1: Belief in the Existence of God</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <br>
1. Belief in the existence of God is the primary truth which lies at the foundation of all religious faith and knowledge. Heb. 11:6 “Whosoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists and He rewards those who seek Him.” (R.S.V.) Prov. 1:7 The basis of wisdom.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. The existence of God is a revealed truth. The Bible writers make no attempt to prove that God exists. Jesus Christ advanced no arguments to convince men that there is a God. The Bible teaches the existence of God.<br>
                                                      <br>
3. The following considerations contribute toward belief in the existence of God: <br>
a. God is revealed in Scriptures. <br>
b. The existence of the material universe with its living inhabitants. <br>
c. The universal conviction in men of the existence of a Supreme Being. <br>
d. The universal desire to worship. <br>
e. The universal sense of right and wrong. <br>
f. Jesus Christ’s faith in God. <br>
g. The prophecies of the Scriptures. <br>
                                                      <br>
4. The most important, and the really conclusive, evidence of the existence of God is to be found in one’s personal experience. Some testimonies of those who knew God:<br>
Jesus John 7: 29; 10:15; 17:25 <br>
Jeremiah Jer. 10:10<br>
Job Job 19:25; 42:5 <br>
Paul 2 Tim. 1:12<br>
David Ps. 34:10; 42:2 <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#FF69B4;">Lesson 2: How God Has Revealed Himself</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <br>
1. The first great truth is the fact that God has revealed Himself to men; and we believe because of this revelation. Heb. 1:1 God has spoken to men. “The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate...The Omniscient One is above discussion.” (MH 429) <br>
                                                      <br>
2. God has revealed Himself in nature. Ps. 19:1-4 The material universe reveals God’s glory. <br>
                                                      <br>
3. God has revealed Himself in history. <br>
                                                      <br>
4. God has revealed Himself in the lives of men. <br>
                                                      <br>
5. God has revealed Himself through the prophets. Amos 3:7 “The Lord Eternal never does anything without telling His servants the prophets.” (Moffatt) 6. The best and fullest revelation of God is in the person of Jesus Christ. John 1:18 “God has been unfolded by the divine One.”(Moffatt) “All that man needs to know or can know of God has been revealed in the life and character of His Son.” (8T 286) We recognize that these revelations are dependent on the Bible for interpretation. <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#FF69B4;">Lesson 3: The Written Word</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <br>
1. The Scriptures <br>
The special revealings of divine truth have come to men by the prophets and, in a fuller way, by the appearance of the Son of God among men. (Heb. 1:1,2.) Apart from the Scriptures we would have no way of ascertaining either the messages of the prophets or the facts connected with Christ’s life and teaching. We look upon the Scriptures, therefore, as the written record of God’s revelations to the human race. <br>
                                                      <br>
2. The contents of the Scriptures <br>
The Scriptures (from the Latin scriptura, which, like the Greek graphai, means “writings”) come to us in the form of 66 books. This collection of writings has come to be known as the Bible, from the Greek word biblos, meaning “book.” <br>
                                                      <br>
3. Their date of composition <br>
The earliest writer of Scripture was Moses, who wrote about 1,500 years before Christ. Therefore the 39 books of the Old Testament were written over a period of one thousand years. The 27 books of the New Testament were all written before the close of the first century A.D., with the last, the book of Revelation, being written by John the apostle about A.D. 95. Thus, the writing of the books which constitute the Bible covered a period of approximately 1,600 years. <br>
                                                      <br>
4. Their authorship In the main it was written by some 35 authors, but these men doubtless secured information and used documents written by many other writers. <br>
                                                      <br>
5. Their arrangement <br>
The order of the books in the Hebrew Bible of Christ’s day was not identical with their arrangement in our Bible. There were three main divisions of the Hebrew Bible, as follows:<br>
i. The Law Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.<br>
ii. The Prophets Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and The Twelve (the minor prophets).<br>
iii. The Writings Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles. <br>
                                                      <br>
The books of our English Bible are, on the whole, grouped according to their literary character, as follows: <br>
Old Testament<br>
i. Law Genesis to Deuteronomy<br>
ii. Poetry Job to Song of Solomon<br>
iii. Prophecy Isaiah to Malachi <br>
                                                      <br>
New Testament<br>
i. History Matthew to Acts<br>
ii. Letters Romans to Jude<br>
iii. Prophecy Revelation <br>
                                                      <br>
6. Their Language <br>
The Old Testament was written in Hebrew except for a few sections which were written in Aramaic. The New Testament was written in Greek and was first translated into English by John Wycliffe in 1382-1388. The King James, or Authorized, Version of the Bible was made in 1611.

                                                   <span style="color:#FF69B4;">Lesson 4: The Reliability of the Bible </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <br>
1. The claim of Scripture <br>
The Scriptures claim to bring us a message from God, not merely to acquaint us with the opinions of the men who wrote them. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) 2 Peter 1:21 The prophecies of the Bible did not originate with men but were prompted by the Spirit of God. <br>
                                                      <br>
2. The attitude of Christ and the apostles to Scripture <br>
Christ and the early apostles received the Scriptures of their day as a reliable and safe guide to the truth containing God’s message to men. John 10:35 “The Scripture cannot be set aside.” (Goodspeed’s translation) John 6:63 Words Jesus speaks are life. “Jesus taught the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority.” (DA 253)<br>
                                                      <br>
3. Scripture claims substantiated <br>
The Scriptures do not furnish us with lengthy arguments to support their claims of divine inspiration. Their authenticity may be tested by evidence which is easily available to every unprejudiced mind. The claim of the Bible to be the medium through which God speaks to us is substantiated by: <br>
a. The evidence of prophecy Isa. 46:9, 10 God claims the ability to foretell. In the Bible there are prophecies which have foretold: The destiny of nations Jer. 29: 10-14 The course of political events Dan. 2:36-45 Events in the natural world Matt. 24:29 The future of cities Isa. 13: 19-22; Eze. 26 The experiences of the church Rev. 12; 2 Thes. 2 The leading facts concerning Christ John 5:39; Luke 24:27, 44 <br>
b. The evidence of personal experience 1 Peter 1:23 The word of God transforms the life <br>
                                                      <br>
4. The accuracy of the Bible <br>
The discoveries of archaeology have proved the historical and geographical data of the Scriptures to be marvelously accurate and true to fact. Check out numerous articles on recent archaeological discoveries in magazines such as Ministry. (Under the General Conference web page, click Ministerial, then Ministry Magazine.) <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#FF69B4;">Lesson 5: How to Study the Bible</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <br>
1. The importance of Bible study <br>
Since the Bible brings us the revelation of God and acquaints us with His will, its study is of supreme importance. Joshua 1:1, 2, 6-8 The Lord urged Joshua to meditate on the instructions He had given through Moses. “There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God’s word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times.” (SC 90) <br>
                                                      <br>
2. The primary requisite <br>
It is important to recognize that the primary requisite for the study of the Bible is spiritual. 1 Cor. 2:7-10, 13, 14 The unconverted mind does not understand the wisdom of God. The spiritual man possesses spiritual discernment in all things, and is therefore misjudged by the worldly man. When we say that the primary requisite for a true understanding of the Bible is spiritual, we have in mind: <br>
a. A reverent attitude Ps. 89: 6, 7; 119: 161 <br>
b. An humble mind Isa. 57:15; Ps. 143:10 <br>
c. Prayerful spirit Ps. 119: 18<br>
d. A receptive heart Jer. 15:16 <br>
e. An obedient will Ps. 119:11; John 7:17 <br>
                                                      <br>
3. Guiding principles in Bible study <br>
In order to obtain a correct understanding of a scripture, the Bible student should give careful attention to the following: <br>
a. The correct reading of the text <br>
b. The grammatical construction of the text <br>
c. The meaning of words <br>
d. The context <br>
e. The historical setting One should recognize the unity of Scripture principle: Since the real Author of Scripture is the Holy Spirit, we may properly compare all passages on the same topic for fuller understanding. (Luke 24: 27, 44) <br>
                                                      <br>
4. The benefits of Bible study <br>
Heb. 5:13, 14 Helps us discern between good and evil John 5:39 Acquaints us with Christ 2 Tim. 3:15 Imparts the wisdom of salvation 2 Tim. 3:16, 17 Equips us for God’s service, “equipped for every good work.” (R.S.V.) John 17:17 Sanctifies the life Eph. 6:12-17 Makes us strong in the battle with sin Ps. 119:11 Gives us victory over sin 1 Peter 2:2 Produces spiritual growth 1 Peter 1:23 Is instrumental in producing new birth 2 Peter 1:19 Gives light, reveals future <br>

There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three coeternal Persons. God is immortal, all-powerful, all-know¬ing, above all, and ever present. He is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet known through His self-revelation. God, who is love, is forever worthy of worship, adoration, and service by the whole creation. (Gen. 1:26; Deut. 6:4; Isa. 6:8; Matt. 28:19; John 3:16 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 13:14; Eph. 4:4 6; 1 Peter 1:2.) <br>

God the eternal Father is the Creator, Source, Sustainer, and Sovereign of all creation. He is just and holy, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers exhibited in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also those of the Father.

God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became also truly hu¬man, Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced tempta¬tion as a human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. <br>
                                                      <br>
By His miracles He manifested God’s power and was attested as God’s promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to heaven to minister in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in glory for the final deliverance of His people and the restoration of all things.

God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in Creation, incarnation, and redemption. He is as much a person as are the Father and the Son. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ’s life with power. He draws and convicts human beings; and those who respond He renews and transforms into the image of God. Sent by the Father and the Son to be always with His children, He extends spiritual gifts to the church, empowers it to bear witness to Christ, and in harmony with the Scriptures leads it into all truth.

God has revealed in Scripture the authentic and historical account of His creative activity. He created the universe, and in a recent six-day creation the Lord made “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” and rested on the seventh day. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual memorial of the work He performed and completed during six literal days that together with the Sabbath constituted the same unit of time that we call a week today. The first man and wom¬an were made in the image of God as the crowning work of Creation, given dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. When the world was finished it was “very good,” declaring the glory of God. (Gen. 1-2; 5; 11; Exod. 20:8-11; Ps. 19:1 6; 33:6, 9; 104; Isa. 45:12, 18; Acts 17:24; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2; 11:3; Rev. 10:6; 14:7.)</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

Man and woman were made in the image of God with individuality, the power and freedom to think and to do. Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity of body, mind, and spirit, dependent upon God for life and breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their dependence upon Him and fell from their high position. <br>
                                                      <br>
The image of God in them was marred and they became subject to death. Their descendants share this fallen nature and its con¬sequences. They are born with weaknesses and tendencies to evil. But God in Christ reconciled the world to Himself and by His Spirit restores in penitent mortals the image of their Maker. Created for the glory of God, they are called to love Him and one another, and to care for their environment.

All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, endowed with freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, God’s adversary, and led into rebellion a portion of the angels. He introduced the spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. <br>
                                                      <br>
This human sin resulted in the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the disordering of the created world, and its eventual devastation at the time of the global flood, as pre¬sented in the historical account of Genesis 1-11. Observed by the whole creation, this world became the arena of the univer¬sal conflict, out of which the God of love will ultimately be vindicated. To assist His people in this controversy, Christ sends the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect, and sustain them in the way of salvation. (Gen. 3; 6-8; Job 1:6-12; Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:12 18; Rom. 1:19-32; 3:4; 5:12-21; 8:19-22; 1 Cor. 4:9; Heb. 1:14; 1 Peter 5:8; 2 Peter 3:6; Rev. 12:4 9.)</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

Youths and staff have the opportunity to publicly show their commitment to the principles and objectives of Youth clubs.<br>
                                                      <br>
Promises are made and principles are recited, at the end – Youths, staff and church members, leave with a sense of commitment and purpose<em>.</em><br>
                                                      <br>
After the recitations, anthems and devotion the induction starts:<br>
The Inducting Officer shall match smartly to the front and gives the brief introduction of the program and also declares the induction ceremony in order as he lights the Spirit of Adventist Youth Ministry The Inducting officer says the following words as he lights the Spirit, “For the light of our program we turn to the Spirit of Adventist Youth Ministry. It is the Spirit of Fellowship, Worship, Learning, Discipleship, Togetherness, and above all it is the Spirit of Service for God and man from which all the four Ministries get their power. <br>
                                                      <br>
Therefore, I will now be calling the Directors to come and start conducting the Induction ceremonies for their Clubs.<br>

Place a table in front of the Church. Put a large Pathfinder Emblem directly behind the table, with a Pathfinder Pledge banner on the right of the emblem and a Pathfinder Law banner to the left of the emblem. <br>
                                                      <br>
In the center of the table directly in front of the Pathfinder emblem place a White big candle to represent the spirit of Pathfinder Club. In front of this candle put six (06) candles–blue, red, green, silver (black), burgundy, and gold, which represent the six Pathfinder Classes. <br>
                                                      <br>
On the right of the Spirit candle place Seven (07) candles to represent the Pathfinder Pledge and Eight (08) candles on the left to represent the Pathfinder Law.<br>
                                                      <br>

As the program starts, the Director, the Deputy and the Pathfinders match to the front in two files smartly. Then halt at least five (05) meters away from the table. The Director will advance and gets permission to conduct the induction from the Chief Marshal (Inducting Officer). <br>

The Inducting Officer Sir, permission to conduct the induction ceremony for the Pathfinder Sir!<br>
                                                      <br>
After permission has be granted, and the director gives a brief on the pathfinder Club, and pronounces the induction ceremony in order for the club:<br>
“I hereby declare the induction ceremony of the ______________ Pathfinder Club now in order.”<br>
                                                      <br>
The director lights the “Spirit of Pathfinder Club” candle while saying:<br>
“For the light of our program we turn to the Spirit of Pathfinder Club. The candle that I now light represent this spirit. It is the spirit of Adventure, Fun, Learning, Comradeship Awareness, and Awakening, and above all, a spirit of Reverence and a Spirit of Service to God and man. This light is of itself not complete or sufficient. To introduce the complementary lights, we call on our Deputy Director.” (If possible mention his/her name)<br>

When the six Pathfinder Class candles have been lit, the director then explains to the candidate that the large candle is symbolic of the Pathfinder program, emphasizing the high ideals for which the club stands and the growth that the Pathfinder will make as a club member.<br>

In turn, each of the eight Pathfinders marches smartly to the front, salutes the director with a hand salute, and lights one of the Pathfinder Law candles.<br>
                                                      <br>
After the Pathfinder lights the candle he again salutes the director and repeats, “Sir, I represent the candidate who hereby vows to: (repeats one of the following definitions according to the candle he has lit.”<br>

After each candle is lit, the Pathfinder repeats to the director, <br>
“Sir, I represent the candidate, who pledges (repeats one of the following points according to the candle he has lit).”<br>
                                                      <br>

“<strong>I will be kind</strong>” meaning that I will rise above the wicked world in which I live and keep my life clean with words and actions that will make others happy.<br>
                                                      <br>
“<strong>I will be true,</strong>” meaning I will be honest and upright in study, work and play and can always be counted upon to do my very best.<br>
                                                      <br>
“<strong>I will keep the Pathfinder Law,</strong>” meaning I will seek to understand the meaning of the Pathfinder Law and will strive to live up to its spirit, realizing that obedience to law is essential in any organization.<br>
                                                      <br>
“<strong>I will be a servant of God,</strong>” meaning I will pledge myself to serve God first, last and best in everything I am called upon to be or do.<br>
                                                      <br>
“<strong>I will be a friend to man,</strong>” meaning I will live to bless others and do unto them as I would have them do unto me.<br>
                                                      <br>
At the completion of the lighting of the Pathfinder Pledge candles, the Deputy Director declares,<br>
“On behalf of the worldwide Pathfinder Club I accept the candidate’s vow to live by the Pathfinder Pledge.”<br>
                                                      <br>
The Director then asks the candidates to stand at attention and gets permission from the Inducting Officer to go and take position in the audience as they wait for the final charge.<br>

In the center of the table directly in front of the Ambassador emblem place a White big candle to represent the spirit of Ambassador Club. In front of this candle put four (04) candles–which represent the four elements of Ambassador Classes modules.<br>
                                                      <br>

As the program starts, the Director, the Deputy and the Ambassadors match to the front in two files smartly. Then halt at least five (05) meters away from the table. The Director will advance and gets permission to conduct the induction from the Chief Marshal (Inducting Officer).<br>
                                                      <br>
Note: The Ambassadors for Pledge will be to the right and those for the program foundations will be to left as they face the table.<br>

                                                      <br>
For the light of our program, we turn to the Spirit of Adventist Youth. The candle which I now light represent this Spirit. It is the Spirit of adventure, fun, learning, comradely, awareness, and awakening, and above all, a spirit of reverence and a spirit of service to God and man. This light is of itself not complete or sufficient. To introduce the complimentary lights, we call on the Ambassador Deputy Leader.<br>
The Deputy Ambassador Director will march smartly and gets permission from the Ambassador Director and thereafter takes position in from to the left side of the Director.<br>
                                                      <br>
The Ambassador Deputy Director says the following:<br>
The Ambassador Club is an organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church dedicated to meeting the Spiritual, Social and lifestyle needs of the youths between the age of 16 and 21.<br>
                                                      <br>
The name ambassador itself suggests that they are representative of the Heavenly Kingdom. Therefore, the Ambassador program gives the Youths opportunity to learn, experience and share the relationship they have with Jesus to the world.<br>
To accomplish the Club’s objectives, the Ambassador program is based on Seven (07) foundations each presented into modules whose focus is based on Four (04) Elements.<br>

It represents the extension of the divine mandate of our Lord Jesus in a universal scope. It is a challenge to the youth to understand the divine command. Adventist youth can help in four different ways to finish the ask: Living consecrated lives, making themselves available for every opportunity to serve, praying for the Lord’s work both locally and worldwide, and giving sacrificially of their own financial means to spread the gospel and finish the Lord’s work. Thus they enter into true stewardship, giving their time, their talents, their means, and themselves.<br>
                                                      <br>
At the completion of the lighting of the Ambassador Pledge candles, the Deputy Ambassador Director declares, “On behalf of the worldwide Youth Club I accept the candidate’s vow to live by the Ambassador Pledge.”<br>
                                                      <br>
The Director then asks the candidates to stand at attention and gets permission from the Inducting Officer to go and take position in the audience as they wait for the final charge.<br>

The Spirit of Adventist Youth candle represents the good things in the Adventist Youth program. It represents the high ideals for which the club stands and the growth that each Young Adult will make as a club member.<br>
We will now call on the candidate to come and light the candle which represents Adventist Youth Aim<br>
                                                      <br>
Sir/Madam, I represent the candidates whose Aim is, <br>
“To take the Advent message to all the world in my generation”.<br>
How universal and at the same time how definite is this Aim!<br>
                                                      <br>
“<strong>The message</strong>” is that which the youth will take.<br>
“<strong>To all the world</strong>” is where the youth will take the message.<br>
“<strong>In this generation</strong>” tells us when it will be taken.<br>
                                                      <br>

Inspired by this motto, Adventist youth all over the world, in harmony with the marvelous aim, move forward in the conquest of souls for the kingdom of God. <br>
The motto, based on 2 Cor. 5:14, is the motivating force in the Adventist youth movement. Without love there is only formation and certain failure. With the love of Christ success is sure, because it is a love that never deceives us. This is the love that always triumphs. It advances in the face of any difficulty, until the task is done, the conflict won, and the victory achieved.<br>

“<strong>Loving the Lord Jesus, I promise to take an active part in the work of the Adventist Youth Society, doing what I can to help others and to finish the work of the gospel in all the world.</strong>” <br>

After lighting the Pledge candle, the Associate Leader declares, “On behalf of the worldwide Youth Club I accept the candidate’s vow to live by the Adventist Senior Pledge.”<br>

Extend the invitation even to those who did not feel in the forms but want to join the movement.<br>
                                                      <br>
At this time all the youths should affirm their dedication to the high principles of the Adventist youth Ministry by doing the recitations of the Adventist Youth Aim, Motto, Laws, Pledges and the Legion of honor.<br>
                                                      <br>
Then all the Youths are presented with candles, which they may light from the Spirit of Adventist Youth Candle.<br>
                                                      <br>
Sing the songs (this little light of mine, SDAY the great association) as the lights are turned back on.<br>
                                                      <br>
Then the Induction officer will give a charge and after a charge, dedicatory prayers to pray that God gives the youths strength to live up to the high ideals of Adventist Youth Ministry and to be faithful and loyal members.<br>
