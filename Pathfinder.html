By the grace of God, I will be pure and kind and true.<br>
I will keep the Pathfinder Law.<br>
I will be a servant of God and a friend to man.<br>
                           <strong>PATHFINDER LAW</strong><br>
The Pathfinder Law is for me to:<br>
Keep the morning watch.<br>
Do my honest part.<br>
Care for my body.<br>
Keep a level eye.<br>
Be courteous and obedient.<br>
Walk softly in the sanctuary.<br>
Keep a song in my heart.<br>
Go on God’s errands.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#004594;"><strong>HOW TO USE&nbsp; THE INSTrUCTION PLANS<br>
                           </strong></span><span style="color:#19171B;">To assist class instructors in the work of organizing the curriculum into an instruction plan, you will find included a comprehensive suggestion on how to go about designing and completing this work in one year using 30 to 35 minute class periods. When organizing your plan, remember that the Pathfinder year generally follows the school year. In some countries this means that only part of the year is available for meetings, while other countries are not restricted this way, but to accommodate all schedules this plan is based on a minimum of a 20 week schedule. Those clubs with more time are encouraged to adjust the following plan accordingly.<br>
                           <br>
Most conference youth departments conduct three combined events such as rallies, fairs, and camporees each Pathfinder year. While the instruction plans are organized so that there is no work for the Pathfinder to complete on days that they are on campouts or at conference events, several requirements do lend themselves to these actions and may be completed at those times.<br>
Bi-monthly outings are often encouraged by the conference and instructors should try to maximize the use of these times. For further details on bi-monthly outings, see the Pathfinder Staff Manual.<br>
PLEASE NOTE: These plans are suggestions only. By all means modify or adapt them to suit your own situation, resources, and capabilities.<br>

A junior nine years of age may only begin the course:<br>
When they are in Grade 5 or its equivalent.<br>
At the beginning of the semester in which their tenth birthday falls.<br>
Note: Some divisions/unions utilize the grade level exclusively. Where this is the case, Friend is for fifth grade regardless of age.<br>

CLASS PERIODS: ONE<br>
                           <br>
This period is allocated to introduce and explain the Pathfinder Pledge and Law. The memory work is usually done outside of the class.<br>
EXPLANATION<br>
                           <br>
Every boy and girl should have a code by which to shape his life. For the Adventist junior youth, the Pledge and Law is that code. These must be learned and their principles put into practice. Just like any nation that has a constitution, the Pathfinder Pledge and Law is the constitution of our Pathfinder program around the world. All Pathfinders should abide by this constitution, which regulates all activities. Every boy and girl should live their Pledge and Law. Pathfinders in uniform should raise their right hand to shoulder height as a salute when reciting the pledge.<br>
The Pathfinder Pledge<br>
By the grace of God,<br>
I will be pure and kind and true.<br>
I will keep the Pathfinder Law.<br>
                           <br>
I will be a servant of God and a friend to man.<br>
Note: Where the Pledge is used in an AJY Society, the word Pathfinder may be substituted by Junior or AJY.<br>
Meaning of the Pledge<br>
“By the grace of God” means that I will rely on Him, realizing that His strength is made perfect in my weakness. It means that only as I rely on God can I do His will. It means that only through grace are we saved from our sins through the power of Jesus Christ our Savior and Redeemer.<br>
“I will be pure” means I will rise above the wicked world in which I live and keep my life clean with words and actions that will make others happy.<br>
“I will be kind” means that I will be considerate and kind not only to my fellow men but to all of God’s creation as well.<br>
“I will be true” means that I will be honest and upright in study, work, and play and can always be counted on to do my very best.<br>
“I will keep the Pathfinder Law” means that I will seek to understand the meaning of the Pathfinder Law and will strive to live up to its spirit, realizing that obedience to law is essential in any organization. •“I will be a servant of God” means that I pledge myself to serve God first, last, and best in everything I am called upon to be or do.<br>
“I will be a friend to man” means that I will live to bless others and do unto them as I would have them do unto me.<br>
                           <br>
The Pathfinder Law is for me to. . .<br>
Keep the Morning Watch.<br>
Do my honest part.<br>
Care for my body.<br>
Keep a level eye.<br>
Be courteous and obedient.<br>
Walk softly in the sanctuary.<br>
Keep a song in my heart.<br>
Go on God’s errands.<br>
Meaning of the Law<br>
                           <em>Keep the Morning Watch</em>. Every boy and girl should have prayer and Bible study every day. The best way to start the day is by studying the Morning Watch, which has been prepared as a daily devotional for every Seventh-day Adventist junior boy and girl.<br>
The first food I need is the Word of God. I will study and meditate upon it and make it part of my daily devotions.<br>
I will pray, thanking God for His blessings and asking Him for the things I and others need. God has promised to hear me.<br>
I will share what I have learned in the Word of God with my family and others. I want Jesus to come soon, and I want others to know Him personally as I do.<br>
I will keep the Morning Watch because it is the plan of God to enrich my life and prepare me for His kingdom.<br>
                           <em>Do My Honest Part</em>. “The world does not so much need men of great intellect as of noble character” (<em>Education</em>, page 225).<br>
“A character formed according to the divine likeness is the only treasure that we can take from this world to the next. Those who are under the instruction of Christ in this world will take every divine attainment with them to the heavenly mansions. And in heaven we are continually to improve. How important then, is the development of character in this life” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, pages 100, 101).<br>
Recognizing this great need in the world and in my life, I will not be afraid of anything that is my duty. I will cheerfully carry all my responsibilities at home, in school, and in the church. I will show good sportsmanship in play and always strive to do my best.<br>
I will do my honest part by keeping out of trouble, taking care of my money, respecting that which is not mine, and faithfully carrying out all my responsibilities.<br>
                           <em>Care for My Body</em>. “One of the greatest aids in perfecting pure and noble characters in the young, strengthening them to control appetite and refrain from debasing excesses, is sound physical health” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, page 233).<br>
I recognize that the time to establish good habits, to learn self-control and to keep a healthy body is in my youth. I also recognize that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and that I have been entrusted with its care. It is my responsibility to learn principles and norms that will help me live happily and free from the vices and corruptions of the world.<br>
I will endeavor to keep my body strong by deep breathing, exercise, proper diet and dress, and by refraining from the use of alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee and drugs.<br>
                           <em>Keep a Level Eye</em>. At Fort Lincoln, Washington, D.C., there is a statue of Christ that appears to look in all directions. No matter where you stand, the eyes of the Lord are upon you. The Bible says: “The eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good” (Proverbs 15:3).<br>
Keeping a level eye means that no matter where we are, out in the open or in the dark alleys of life, we can look at Jesus straight in the eye and not be afraid. Adam and Eve ran from the presence of God. They could not face Him because they had sinned. In order to keep a level eye, I must not lie or deceive. I will tell the truth even if it hurts. I will despise filthy thinking and dirty talk. I will think more of others than of myself.<br>
                           <em>Be Courteous and Obedient</em>. “The golden rule is the principle of true courtesy, and its truest illustration is seen in the life and character of Jesus. Oh, what rays of softness and beauty shone forth in the daily life of our Saviour! What sweetness flowed from His very presence! The same spirit will be revealed in His children” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, page 420).<br>
I want to be courteous because courtesy is love shining out of a heart that reflects the love of Jesus. I will always give a kindly greeting and ever be ready to help the stranger, the aged, the sick, the poor, and the little ones.<br>
I realize that obedience to God must come first, obedience to parents next, and obedience to teachers and other persons in authority follow. I want to follow the example of Jesus, who was obedient even unto death on the cross. He came to fulfill a mission and was obedient to His heavenly Father.<br>
                           <em>Walk Softly in the Sanctuary</em>. When Moses went into the presence of God to receive the Ten Commandments, the people were told to sanctify themselves and to wash their clothes. They were to be reverent before the God of the universe. “Children and youth should never feel that it is something to be proud of to be indifferent and careless in meetings where God is worshiped” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, page 266).<br>
I will walk softly in the sanctuary, making my feet, my hands, and my heart fit the time and place. God is in the church building because it is dedicated to His service. In the church I will be quiet, careful, and reverent in all I do and say.<br>
I will be reverent in prayer; I will close my eyes and have a proper posture as I talk to God.<br>
I will respect the sanctuary, its buildings, its furniture; I will remember that the angels cover themselves in humility as they approach the throne of God.<br>
                           <em>Keep a Song in My Heart</em>. “The melody of praise is the atmosphere of heaven; and when heaven comes in touch with the earth there is music and song-‘thanksgiving and the voice of melody’” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, page 291).<br>
We know that music is as much an act of worship as is prayer. Many times youth do not understand this and songs are sung without meaning. We must learn to praise God here on earth, for this will be one of the themes of eternity. There should be joy in our hearts because Jesus came and died on the cross for all of us.<br>
I will keep a song in my heart because I am happy, because I’ve been redeemed. I will sing while I am alone and while I am with others. I want them to feel the joy of salvation with me, the joy of a Christian, the happiness one experiences with Christ. I will sing when things are right and I will sing when things are wrong. I know that trials and tribulations are God’s way of teaching and molding me.<br>
“Let there be singing in the home, of songs that are sweet and pure, and there will be fewer words of censure, and more of cheerfulness and hope and joy. Let there be singing in the school, and the pupils will be drawn closer to God, to their teachers, and to one another” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, page 292).<br>
                           <em>Go On God’s Errands</em>. The supreme purpose of every Adventist Junior Youth is to do God’s work. “Children can be acceptable missionary workers in the home and in the church. God desires them to be taught that they are in this world for useful service, not merely for play. In the home they can be trained to do missionary work that will prepare them for wider spheres <br>
of usefulness. Parents, help your children to fulfill God’s purpose for them” (<em>Messages to Young People</em>, page 225).<br>
What a tremendous opportunity to have a part in the finishing of God’s work on earth! Angels would be happy to have this work. But it was given to mankind, to youth, to boys and girls.<br>
I will accept the daily duties of my home and school to prepare me for greater duties. I will plant a garden for the aged lady next door so that someday I might be able to help in an agricultural school in a foreign country. I will help my little brother tie his shoes so that someday I might operate on a patient in a hospital in a mission field. I will clean my father’s garage today so that I can help clean heathenism from the hearts of thousands around me and in distant lands.<br>
I will be more than glad to do God’s errands now because I want to keep doing His work forever. I want to dedicate my life to the preaching of this message and reach millions who are still waiting for salvation in Jesus Christ.<br>

This volume is written by Lawrence Maxwell and may be ordered from the local Adventist Book Center. It may be read individually or as a class project. It is a detailed explanation of the Pledge and Law in story form. There may be another book on this subject available in your area.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">REQUIREMENT 5</span><span style="color:#19171B;"><br>

EXPLANATION<br>
                           <br>
The Book Club selections are chosen to give the juniors a well-rounded reading program of adventure, nature, biography, and inspirational stories. A list is provided by the Adventist Book Center or conference youth department each year. A “current” certificate for the Achievement Classes means for the church year in which one completes his work for investiture. A Book Club Certificate reported for this class may not be used a second time for any other class. When a junior has completed reading the Book Club selections, his name should be forwarded by the leader to the local conference youth department, which will issue a Book Club Certificate.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">ADVANCED REQUIREMENT 1</span><span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
Know, sing, or play and explain the meaning of the Pathfinder song .<br>

CLASS PERIODS: ONE<br>
                           <br>
EXPLANATION<br>
                           <br>
This requirement could be worked into the opening exercises of each meeting. Sing the song and then have a junior share some thoughts explaining a portion of it.<br>
If your group is small, have them give only part of the song at one time. Example, “Oh, we are the Pathfinders strong.” Then would follow an explanation of two minutes on how a Pathfinder is interested in and tries to develop a strong body, good health habits, good food, clean/clear minds, etc.<br>

The juniors will have fun finding the characteristics of Jesus in the books of the Bible.<br>
Have them look up the following names, preferably in the SDA Bible Dictionary, to discover the meaning of the names and how these names reflect how God cares for His people. Have them use pictures and drawings to illustrate what they have found.<br>
The meanings are given here for the teacher’s guidance.<br>

3. Bible Sw</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#19171B;">rd Drill<br>
This is a group activity to give the Friends practice</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#19171B;">in locating the books of the Old Testament quickly. Ephesians 6:13-17 describes the Christian ‘armor’ of which the Sword is the Word of God (verse 17).<br>
Operation<br>
Select participants:<br>
Two Friends to hold the rope<br>
As many participants as desired<br>
Participants will form one straight line beh<em>ind a rop</em>e held immediately in front of them approximately 50 cm from the floor. Their Bible is to be held (sheathed) under their left arm.<br>
Leader will give the commands: “ATTEN-TION” “DRAW SWORDS” Friends quickly bring their right hand across their body - draw their sword (Bible) and hold it in front of them, closed, waist high, ready to find the reference.<br>
Leader announces the reference, e.g. “The Book of Psalms” (begin with the large, well-known books), or ask for a book from one of the sections, e.g. history, poets. The exercise becomes more difficult as you call the Minor Prophets or ask for specific chapter and verse.<br>
No Friend moves until the order is given: “CHARGE.” The rope is dropped to their feet while the Friends quickly find the reference. Immediately after the reference is found, take one pace forward, keeping one hand on the open page of the Bible.<br>
A ten second time limit is given from the command “CHARGE” to find the reference and step one pace forward. (Vary the time limit to suit the experience of your group.)<br>
The time keeper will call “TIME” as the time limit expires. The rope will immediately be raised, perhaps catching some Friends part way across. They should return behind the line.<br>
Each participant who steps across the line before the time limit is reached is a winner.<br>
An appointed judge will inspect the references.<br>
An award of two points can be given to each winner. See who is the first to get to twenty.<br>
Leader shall call “ONE PACE BACKWARD MARCH:” Rope keeper shall lower the rope and raise it again after the Friends have crossed it.<br>
Leader shall call “SHEATH SWORDS.” Friends quickly tuck their Bibles under their left arm and return right hand to their side.<br>
Ready now to repeat activity from “DRAW SWORDS.”<br>
Personnel<br>
Leader - who gives commands; prepare references before the meeting.<br>
Two people to hold and drop the rope.<br>
Two judges. One judg<em>e to watc</em>h the crossing of the rope, especially those who only get halfway when “TIME” is called. Second judge to check accuracy of references.<br>
Time keeper, who with stop watch or second hand on wrist watch, calls “TIME”.<br>
Score keeper to keep track of scores.<br>
4. Learn the Books of the Bible to Music<br>

TEACHING METHOD</span><span style="color:#000000;">S</span><span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
                           <br>
Each child can m</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#19171B;">ke up an art folder with the texts recorded and illustrated with pictures from magazines, etc. To be done during the week as a regular project at home.<br>
In addition to learning the memory gem, each child can bring a picture that illustrates the text so that a poster can be made up from the group collection each week. Posters can then be used to decorate the meeting place.<br>
Encourage the junior to learn the memory gem as part of his daily worship.<br>
Recite memory gems as a voice choir.<br>
Suggestions for the Weekly Review of the Memory Gems:<br>
Repetition Review: After having a few juniors say the verse for the day, call on all to say it together, then all the girls, then the boys, then perhaps the teachers. Close by having all say it together, and see if all can take part. If possible, continue until they can. (Always have reference repeated each<em> time the verse i</em>s said.)<br>
Missing Word Review: Write text clearly on board before meeting, and rub out about every second word, particularly any catch ones, and usually the first one, which is not always easy to remember. Ask different ones to supply the missing words, requesting that only the one asked should respond. In small grou<em>ps members might be</em> asked sometimes to come out and write in the word.<br>
Competition Review: When there are about equal numbers of girls and boys, draw a line down the center of the blackboard, heading sides respectively GIRLS - BOYS. Then put a mark for each one that correctly recites the verse for the day under the proper heading, and see which side will win.<br>
Word Review: Have<em> text repeated by </em>twos or threes or all together once or twice, then ask for each one in rows to repeat the following word without hesitancy. Then move about from one to another, pointing to the one you wish to supply the word. Only the one to whom you point should respond, but pass on fair<em>ly quickly </em>so that the review will be brisk and interesting.<br>
Question Review: Ask as many questions as you can on the texts under study. In some instances two or three questions can be asked on one text, but mix them among questions on other texts. Request that answers be given, if possible, in the exact words of Scripture.<br>
Text Bee Review: Divide the group in about <em>half. Then have</em> members of one side call for a text or ask a question of a member on the other side. If answered, that side does the asking, if not, the same side asks again. (Conduct something after the style of a spelling bee.)<br>
Surprise Reviews: Have references t<em>o date written </em>clearly on different slips of folded paper. Give one to each member before meeting, asking them not to open until asked to do so. For review, call names one by one, ask them to rise, open slip, and say the verse called for. The reference should be read aloud<em> so that all can</em> determine if the right text is quoted.<br>
During another period write out the texts on slips of paper, as in No. 7, and have the references given in the same way.<br>
Reference Test: Put on blackboard something like the following:<br>
 __________ 29: 11 Psalm _____: 8<br>
 Isaiah _____: 12 Timothy 5: _____<br>
 __________ 11: _____&nbsp;&nbsp; __________ _____: 58<br>
 Ask different ones to fill in as for “Missing Word” review.<br>
10.Written Test: Before the meeting, put two or three que<em>stions on the </em>board in clear script and hand out paper and penci</span><span style="color:#000000;">l</span><span style="color:#19171B;">. Reveal questions on the board and </span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#19171B;">sk all to try and answer them. Tell t</span><span style="color:#000000;">h</span><span style="color:#19171B;">em it is not an examination, and that each pers</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#19171B;">n will correct his or her own answers.<br>
11.Thought Review: Put a t<em>hought from </em>each verse on board and ask members to tell which texts contain these thoughts or statements.<br>
12.Bible Study Review: Devote a meeting to full Bible study review. This could be worked up in the form of a dialogue or delivered as a study by one or more members of the societ<em>y, the remaini</em>ng members, or a few specially chosen ones to form the audience. These could be encouraged to ask questions that would <em>be possible to ans</em>wer with the texts learned.<br>

Know and explain Psalm 23 or Psalm 46 .<br>
                           <br>
CLASS PERIODS: TWO<br>
                           <br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
                           <br>
To know Jesus as friend and protector and to discover personal meaning in the Scriptures.<br>
EXPLANATION<br>
                           <br>
Psalm 23: Probably the best known and best loved of all the Psalms is Psalm 23, universally known as “The Shepherd’s Ps</span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">alm.” <br>
It is </span><span style="color:#19171B;">at once the delight of childhood and the consolation of old age. It has been variously called “The Pearl of Psalms,” “The Nightingale Psalm,” “The Shepherd’s Song About His She<em>pherd,” </em>etc. Augustine noted that this Psalm was the hymn of the martyrs. Undoubtedly more books and articles have been written on this Psalm and more poems and hymns composed on its theme than on any other of the Psalms. It has a message for people of every age.<br>
But it is more than “The Shepherd’s Psalm.” It paints not only the picture of the tender Shepherd, who leads His flock to rest and feed “in green pastures beside the still waters” and protects them from the perils of the wilderness, but also the picture of the gracious Host, who provides a super-abundance of food and solicitous care for His guest. The Psalm closes with a confession of absolute confidence in Jehovah to lead His child lovingly through this life and to entertain him as His guest to the end of his days.<br>
The poem falls into three stanzas. The first two (vs. 1-3 and 3-5) present the ideas of loving guidance and protection; the third (vs. 5, 6) presents the idea of hospitality provided by a host.<br>
Psalm 23 has no touch of nationalism. It is universal in its appeal. The experiences of David as a shepherd in the ruggedness of the Judean hills, then later as a royal host in the opulence of the Oriental court in the capital city, surely fitted him for writing this sweetest of sacred lyrics.<br>
Psalm 46: Has been designated “Luther’s Psalm” because the greater reformer, who was accustomed to singing it in time of trouble, paraphrased it in his hymn, “A Mighty Fortress,” No. 506 in The SDA Hymnal. The Psalm is a glorious hymn on the theme that, in the midst of the upheavals of nations, God’s people<em> are saf</em>e. To express this theme, so pertinent also to the last days, the psalmist chose a form of verse unusually regular for Hebrew poetry. Three stanzas practically equal in length, with <em>refrain and Se</em>lah appropriately placed, present pictures involving striking contrasts: roaring waters and rocking mountains, and a quiet river; nations in turmoil, and the earth melting at the voice of the Lord; the desolation of war, and God ruling quietly above the nations. After a notable victory in the days of Jehoshaphat, the Israelites sang this hymn (PK 201 and 203). Psalms 46, 47, and 48 are closely related in thought and probably share the same background. That David was the author of Ps. 46 may be inferred from PK 203.<br>
Oliver Cromwell, it is said, asked the people to sing this Psalm, saying: “That is a rare psalm for a Christian. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. If pope and … devil set themselves against us, yet in the name of the Lord we shall destroy them. The Lord of hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge.” Psalm 46 was sung in Paris by the revolutionists of 1847, and in India by the hard-pressed British in the Sepoy rebellion. It may well be the hymn of God’s people during the increasing perils of the last days.<br>
TEACHING METHODS<br>
                           <br>
Rewrite the Psalm in your own words on a large piece of paper, leaving room to illustrate with drawings or pictures.<br>
Have the Friend class become a voice choir and present the Psalm as an item during a church service.<br>
Divide the verses among the Friend class and have each member make up a visual aid to demonstrate his understanding of his particular section. Spend a meeting putting it all together with each child explaining his own discoveries.<br>
Write out the Psalm by hand from a modern translation and illustrate verse by verse.<br>
The author of Ps. 23 and Ps. 46 was a man who enjoyed the out-of-doors experience. It would be very appropriate for the juniors in their study and memorization of these chapters to have it included as part of a campout program.<br>

REQUIREMENT 4<br>
During several worship periods, read with your parents the historical prologue to the book Early Writings and list the main events of the founding of the SDA church .<br>
CLASS PERIODS: TWO<br>
                           <br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
                           <br>
To help the Friends understand the background of events that occurred during the establishment o</span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">f the Seventh</span><span style="color:#19171B;">-day Adventist Church.<br>
TEACHING METHODS<br>
                           <br>
The prologue begins on page VII and concludes on pa<em>ge XXXll. It i</em>s divided into 19 short segments that could adapt well to family worship. These could also serve for club worship, AY Society study and panel discussions, etc.<br>
It is hoped that by the end of the readings each student would be able to successfully complete the student’s questionnaire consisting of eleven basic questions, which are covered in the Historical Prologue.<br>
In some countries, an audio-visual program on this time period is available. If it is available in your area, it may be utilized as a substitute or enrichment. The program may be known as “The Midnight Cry” or other similar title.<br>
STUDENT QUESTIONNAIRE<br>
Following is a choice of two different quizzes that should be administered to Friend candidates after they have studied the Historical Prologue to the book Early Writings. It is suggested that this would be a good way to evaluate the knowledge gained during the fulfillment of this requ</span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">irement.<br>
The Seventh-</span><span style="color:#19171B;">day Adventist Church was born out of a world-wide movement known as (The Great Advent Awakening). In North America, this movement was led by a New York farme<em>r-minister nam</em>ed (William Miller).<br>
Careful study of prophecies in the book of (Daniel) caused William Miller to arrive at the conclusion that (Christ would return to earth) in about the year (1844).<br>
Following the (Disapp<u>ointment of October 22) ma</u>ny believers and&nbsp; ministers dropped away.<br>
Ellen Harmon received her (first visio<u>n)&nbsp; only (two </u>months) after the disappointment. She saw a (br<u>ight l</u>ight) at the beginning of a long (pathway), and (Christ) w<u>as (leading) the people to t</u>he (City of God) .<br>
An<u>othe</u>r denomination sti<u>ll surviving today born of t</u>his movement is the (Advent Christian Church). They differ from SDA’s pri<u>marily on th</u>e doctrin<u>es of (the</u> Gift of Prophecy and the Sabbath).<br>
A g<u>roup led by </u>(Hiram Edson) was the first to<u> correc</u>t the er<u>ror re</u>garding<u> the cl</u>eansing of the (Sanct<u>uary) becau</u>se of a vision he had while (crossing a cornfield).<br>
The Sabbath was first int<u>roduced to the Advent b</u>elievers by (Rachel Oakes), who was a (Seventh-day Baptis<u>t) attending church with some believ</u>ers in the small to<u>wn of (Wash</u>ington, New Hampshire).<br>
Later, (Joseph Bates), a prominent minister, <u>also acce</u>pted the Sabbath truth and wrote a p<u>amphlet that convinc</u>ed&nbsp; (James) and (Ellen White) of the truth.<br>
The first official p<u>ublication b</u>y the Advent b<u>elievers was called</u> (The Present Truth). There were only (eleven) issues startin<u>g in July (1849) and endi</u>ng in Novem<u>ber 1850.<br>
Wh</u>en the Whites moved to (Battle Creek) in 1855 they had already published several small books, a<u> regu</u>lar chu<u>rch journal</u>, which today we call (Adventist Review),and a magazine for youth called&nbsp; (The Yout<u>h’s Instructor).<br>
                           </u>It wasn’t until (186<u>0) tha</u>t the name Seventh-day Adve<u>ntis</u>t was settled on, and then in 1863 the (General Conferenc<u>e) was organ</u>ized.<br>

Publishing began with a small paper called the ___________________ Truth and was seen in vision as “streams of _______________ that went clear round the world.”<br>
Preaching of the gospel went through a transition based on the understanding of two texts: “The _______________ of mercy was _______________” and “I have set before thee an ___________________ door, and no man can <em>shut </em>it.”<br>
The church began to organize based on a statement by an angel in vision who said “everything in heaven was in perfect __________________.”<br>

The book of Jonah</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#19171B;">is</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#19171B;">the only one of the twe</span><span style="color:#000000;">l</span><span style="color:#19171B;">ve so-called Min</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#19171B;">r Prophets that is stri</span><span style="color:#000000;">c</span><span style="color:#19171B;">tly narrative in form.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#19171B;">It is an account of Jona</span><span style="color:#000000;">h</span><span style="color:#19171B;">’s mission to the city of </span><span style="color:#000000;">N</span><span style="color:#19171B;">ineveh to announce its speedy destruction because of its si</span><span style="color:#000000;">n</span><span style="color:#19171B;">s. The prophet entertains </span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#19171B;">isgivings and perplexities as to</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#19171B;">his carrying out the charge of God to go to Nine</span><span style="color:#000000;">v</span><span style="color:#19171B;">eh. The very thought of journey</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#19171B;">ng to this great metropolis, the difficulties and seeming impossibilities of the task, made him shrink from undertaking the divine commission and question its wisdom. Failing to rise to that strong faith that should have led him to realize that with the divine command came the divine power to accomplish it, Jonah sank into discouragement, dread, and despair (see PK 266). Knowing the loving- kindness and long-suffering of God, Jonah was also afraid that if he delivered the divine message and the heathen accepted it, the threatening doom he pronounced upon them would not come to pass. This would be a deep humiliation to him, as it thus turned out to be, and this he could not endure (Ch. 4:1,2). He at first disobeyed, but through a series of events was led to carry out the commission. The inhabitants of Nineveh repented, and for a time turned from their sins. Jonah was angry, but God justified His gracious dealings.<br>
Among the lessons taught by Jonah’s prophecy is the truth that God’s grace brings salvation to all (Titus 2:11), that it was indeed not confined to the Jews, but was also to be revealed among the heathen. God has “also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life” (Acts 11:18). Like Peter (Acts 10), Jonah came to realize reluctantly that God was willing to receive those of every nation who turned to Him. By repentance, Jesus condemned the pharisaical and prideful Jews of His day (see Matt. 12:41; Luke 11:32) and all others who, in their religious complacency and false sense of soul security, deceive themselves into thinking that they are the favored people of God, and thus assured of salvation.<br>
Jesus used the experience of Jonah in the sea as an illustration of His death and resurrection (Matt. 12:39, 40). His reference to the book of Jonah established the veracity of the book.<br>
D. Esther<br>
Considered as literature, the book of Esther is an epic. It depicts a crisis in the fortunes of God’s people that threatened them with annihilation. The instrument of deliverance is a Jewess, elevated from a quiet life with her cousin and foster father, Mordecai, to be queen of a world empire. The narrative displays Esther as a woman of clear judgement, remarkable self- control, and noble self-sacrifice. The challenge of Mordecai, “Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (ch. 4: 14), projected the youthful queen to the heights of heroic action. In solemn dignity, her spirit rose to answer the demand of the hour in the courageous and thrilling words, “If I perish, I perish.” When at the critical moment the scepter was held out to her, she did not immediately identify the villain, but with remarkable restraint and deliberate care guided the king and Haman into a situation calculated to be most favorable to her purpose. Fiction could not conceive of a more dramatic and surprising series of coincidences than those that led up to the exposure and death of Haman. In Purim, the Feast of Lots, the Jews ever commemorated heaven’s disposal of Haman’s evil plan, which a cast lot had presumably indicated would succeed (see 3:7).<br>
The religious character and moral teaching of the book of Esther may be summarized thus:<br>
Though God’s name does not appear in the entire book, His providence is manifest throughout. No disbeliever in God could possibly have written the book; no believer can read it without finding his faith strengthened. Deliverance is presented by the writer as the result of a living faith in God.<br>
The book of Esther provides an account of the origin of an important Jewish national festival, the Feast of Purim, which is still observed with rejoicing each year.<br>
A vital moral lesson pervades the narrative. With the passing of Haman’s brief day of popularity, the transitory nature of earthly power and prosperity becomes painfully evident. God humbles the proud and exalts those who trust in Him.<br>
The providence of God is strikingly displayed. Divine power is united with human effort. The means used are human, but the deliverance itself is divine.<br>

REQUIREMENT </span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">2<br>
Prove yours</span><span style="color:#19171B;">elf a good citizen at home and school .<br>
                           <br>
CLASS PERIODS: ONE<br>
                           <br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
                           <br>
To give study to those character qualifications that are vital to the Christian young person’s influence at home and at school.<br>
TEACHING METHODS<br>
                           <br>
Discuss with your group the following thoughts about citizenship at home and at school.<br>
You are going to be a man or woman in a very few short years. What kind of man or woman do you want to be? Look around and find the qualities you would like to see in yourself.<br>
First, you will want to be as fit and active as your body will allow you to be. The person who can’t jump up and run an errand for his mother because he is too tired is not of great value in the home.<br>
Second, you will want to complete the errand to the best of your ability. If the shop doesn’t have the article you have been asked to purchase, then you will choose the nearest alternative or try the shop down the road.<br>
So in this simple task are some of the qualities of a good citizen:<br>
Obedience: you acted promptly.<br>
Self-reliance: you knew where to go and how to get there.<br>
Thoughtfulness: you were only asked once.<br>
Dependability: you certainly carried out your job.<br>
Co-operation: you would help anyone to the best of your ability.<br>
What other qualities do you see around you in other people? Your father’s devotion to the family; your religious leader’s understanding; your teacher’s enthusiasm.<br>
Why is it necessary to become a good citizen? You are a part of your country, and as you grow up you will want to take your share of what life has to offer you. What you take and give will depend on the qualities that you put to work for yourself.<br>
Be a thinking citizen, not a thoughtless one. Keep yourself informed of the happenings of the day in your own community, your country, and throughout the world. Learn how your country, your state, your city, town or shire is governed and how you fit into the government. Discover where the government is strong and where it is weak. Do your part as a citizen in the big task of upholding its strengths and overcoming its weaknesses. In many countries, Pathfinders are considered model citizens. What can you do to strengthen that reputation in your country?<br>
Be prepared to do your part in smaller tasks - in such everyday things as obeying traffic regulations, observing the rules of the game when you play, and many other things.<br>
Your teachers have a great responsibility and have a big influence in your life. What is their responsibility? There are many different teachers who teach many subjects at all levels of our educational growth: kindergarten, primary school, secondary school, technical school, university and adult education. Teachers respond to the interest you show in the subject. Therefore, your desire to learn and advance will encourage the teacher to give of his best to help you.<br>
Complete the following:<br>
Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country.<br>
Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country.<br>
Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done.<br>
Know how to explain the process of government in your country.<br>
Explain why laws are established in your country.<br>
(These questions are part of the Christian Citizenship Honor.)<br>

                        <span style="color:#FFFFFF;">REQUIREMENT 1</span><span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
List ten qualities of being a good friend and discuss four everyday situations where you have <br>
practiced the “golden rule” .<br>
                           <br>
CLASS PERIODS: ONE<br>
                           <br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
                           <br>
Pathfinders need to understand the basis of friendship. In the “Golden Rule,” the Bible stipulates where true friendship may begin its growth.<br>
TEACHING METHODS<br>
                           <br>
Some Ellen White comments:<br>
“Speak often words that will be…an inspiration. When one is in trouble,… speak comforting words to him. This is true friendship.” 7 BC 928<br>
“While the Christian will be ever kind, compassionate, and forgiving, he can feel no harmony with sin.” 5 T 171<br>
“Men and women are not fulfilling the design of God when they simply express affection for their own family circle, for their relatives and friends, while they exclude those from their love whom they could comfort and bless...” WM 159<br>
“Their best friend is Jesus. He did not withhold His own life from them, but for their sakes became poor, that through His poverty they might be made rich.” 4T 481<br>
“The spirit of gossip and tale bearing is one of Satan’s special agencies to sow discord and strife, to separate friends...” 4T 195<br>
“[Christ] lifts men from the narrow circle that their selfishness prescribes; He abolishes all territorial lines and artificial distinctions of society. He makes no difference between neighbors and strangers, friends and enemies.” MB 42<br>
“Satan is constantly seeking the ruin of those who are ignorant concerning his devices yet feel no special need of the prayers and counsel of experienced and godly friends.”&nbsp; 4T 207<br>
“The Lord did not leave you to perish. He frequently raised up friends to aid you when you least expected it.” 2T 270<br>
“In the joy of his new discipleship, Matthew longed to bring his former associates to Jesus. Accordingly, he made a feast at his own house...” DA 273-274<br>
“...The hasty temper, the fretfulness, envy, or jealousy…these evil traits of character bring great unhappiness to their possessors. How many fail to receive from ... friends the love which they might have if they were more amiable.” FE 67<br>
These references and many more can serve as a springboard for group discussion in a Sabbath school class setting, AY Society panel discussion, Pathfinder campfire time, etc.<br>

                           <br>
Friendship is multifaceted. Citizenship—and understanding and appreciating another’s citizenship—contributes to friendship growth.<br>
Encourage any in your group who have a different citizenship to share the anthem meanings with the group. For most this requirement is very easy, as they have been taught in school.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">REQUIREMENT 1</span><span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
 . Discuss the temperance principles in the life of Daniel or participate in a presentation or role play on Daniel .<br>
 . Memorize and explain Daniel 1:8, and either sign the appropriate pledge card or design your own pledge card, showing why you choose a life style in harmony with the true principles of temperance .<br>
CLASS PERIODS: ONE<br>
                           <br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
                           <br>
To inspire the Friends to understand the meaning of the word “temperance” and to make a commitment to follow the example of Daniel.<br>
EXPLANATION<br>
                           <br>
“Temperance” is abstaining from those substances and actions that are harmful and using moderately and carefully those things that are good.<br>
TEACHING METHODS<br>
                           <br>
Some meanings of “Temperance:”<br>
Temperance is self-control through the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>
As we ask, God through His Spirit guides us in the choices we make.<br>
We first choose to serve Him.<br>
We choose to say NO to Satan.<br>
As we ask Him, God gives power to resist temptation.<br>
We choose to eat and drink those things that are healthful in a way that will honor God.<br>
We choose not to eat or drink anything that would be harmful.<br>
We choose to allow God to guide in all our daily activities.<br>
Man was created perfect in the image of God, healthy, and free from disease. Adam and Eve had natural appetites given by God to enjoy what God had made. God also gave them the power of reason, or choice-self-control. They were tempted by Satan to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Being deceived, they used the power of choice wrongly. <br>
They lost their self-control when they came under the influence of Satan. People have been making wrong choices ever since. Lack of temperance is evidence of lack of self-control.<br>
                           <br>
ROLE PLAY<br>
                           <br>
Description of a Role Play:<br>
A role play is an unrehearsed, dramatic enactment of a particular situation.<br>
Participants may either choose or be assigned roles.<br>
Roles should be written or outlined by the leader.<br>
Let the participants get together for a few minutes to discuss what they will do.<br>
Act out the situation extemporaneously (without preparation).<br>
Cut off the action at the proper time and discuss the situation.<br>
Write each of the following characters on a separate piece of paper: Daniel, Shadrach, Meshack, Abednego, Nebuchadnezzar, Servant.<br>
Give each class member a character to play. Read the story found in Daniel 1 and ask the class to act out the drama in two different ways to illustrate the contrast:<br>
Daniel and his three friends as if they were rebellious captives.<br>
Daniel and his three friends as true Israelites, ready to speak up for God.<br>
Daniel 1:8<br>
Have the class read Daniel chapter I and imagine they are judges in a competition. Daniel and his three friends have been voted ten times better than all the rest. Have each judge make a list of all the characteristics that made the Hebrew young men outright winners. The class can then compare their findings.<br>
Have each class member complete a word study of Daniel 1:8 using a Bible Dictionary and Bible Commentary to draw out the total meaning of the verse. Their discoveries can be drawn up in a project or chart form.<br>
Pledge<br>
Design and sign your own pledge card indicating why you have chosen a lifestyle in harmony with the true principles of temperance, or obtain the proper cards from the conference office for each participant to sign.<br>
RESOURCES<br>
                           <br>

                        <span style="color:#FFFFFF;">EQUIREMENT 1</span><span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
Plan and take a three hour or eight km . hike . Plan to complete a requirement under the Nature Study or Outdoor Life sections, or a Nature honor .<br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
                           <br>
Take the initiative in decision making, which will lead to positive results via a fun yet educational activity.<br>
TEACHING METHODS<br>
                           <br>
This is the opportunity to introduce the Pathfinder to the world of nature through a focus of character and lifestyle development. Many clubs take this opportunity to teach through action the concept of Wilderness Stewardship, embodied in the saying:<br>
Take nothing but pictures<br>
Leave nothing but footprints<br>
Kill nothing but time<br>
The distance is not as important as the time spent. Pathfinders can learn to identify flora and fauna, they can look for spiritual lessons, become observant of the presence of God’s creatures, learn the value of silence and camouflage, etc. Emphasis should be placed on the participant’s involvement in deciding the activity and planning the details.<br>
Some additional ideas:<br>
Remember to choose your location and arrange transportation well in advance. Preferably visit the site before-hand so you have some idea of the nature objects the class is likely to find.<br>
Preparation before the nature excursion. In class, sometime before leaving for the nature excursion, have the juniors record the things they would be likely to find. Then with the use of a concordance find the texts where the object is mentioned, e.g. Leaves - Revelation 22:2: “Leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.”<br>
Explain the activity on arrival. On arrival at the nature location, divide the group into pairs, each pair to have a Bible, pencil, and paper. Ask the pairs to discover and record as many objects of nature as they can equate with a Bible passage. The leaders could have a concordance to assist with the location of texts.<br>
Examples are as follows:<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">U</span><span style="color:#19171B;">nusual Jawbone (of ass) Judges 15: 15<br>

                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Boil the water for twenty minutes (from the time it actually starts to boil). This will cause the water to taste flat because the air has been removed, but you can restore its good flavor by stirring it vigorously or pouring it back and forth several times from one container to another.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Use one to two drops of iodine in a liter of water and let it stand for thirty minutes. Iodine purification tablets may be obtained.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Use one part chlorine to 100 parts water. Let stand thirty minutes. Laundry bleach is commonly used.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Halazone or Puritabs are water-purifying tablets that depend on the release of chlorine gas. Therefore, if used, these tablets should be fresh. Keep the bottle tightly closed, with some cotton in it to absorb the moisture. Place the number of tablets directed in the water and let stand for thirty minutes.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">There are numerous mechanical purifiers specifically designed for backpacking available on the market today.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:16px;"><span style="color:#19171B;"/>2. Camp Shelter</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;"><span style="color:#19171B;"/>The simplest type of shelter is the lean-to. It may be made by placing a rope or ridgepole about two meters above the ground between two trees or two stakes and about two meters apart. When selecting forked poles for the uprights, be sure that they are straight from fork to toe, and the toe pointed.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Drape a sheet of plastic, tarpaulin, etc. over the ridgepole. The comers and sides may be held down with pegs or stones. More elaborate lean-tos may have sturdier frames and thatched roofs. A framework of battens is lashed across two forked sticks and long grass, reeds, rushes, ferns, palm leaves or leafy branches may be used as thatching. The thatching may be sewn, tufted, or tied on to the battens. The method used will depend on the material available.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">If you need warmth, keep your lean-to fairly small. It is better to build two lean-tos for four people than one for them all. Always build a lean-to so that its front opening is cross-wind.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">A rubber life raft or a canoe or boat turned over or propped against a rock or log may provide a rough shelter, and can be made into a better one with the aid of a sheet of plastic or tarpaulin or a wall of stones or branches.</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:16px;"><span style="color:#19171B;"/>3. Jesus as the Water of Life</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;"><span style="color:#19171B;"/><em>A. John 4:4-42, Story of the Woman at the Well</em></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">“This water represents the life of Christ, and every soul must have it by coming into living connection with God” (<em>Testimonies to Ministers</em>, p. 226).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">“Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">He who seeks to quench his thirst at the fountains of this world will drink only to thirst again. Everywhere men are unsatisfied. </span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Only One can meet that want. The need of the world, “The Desire of all nations,” is Christ. The divine grace which He alone can impart, is as living water, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Jesus did not convey the idea that merely one drought of the water of life would suffice the receiver. He who tastes of the love of Christ will continually long for more; but he seeks for nothing else. And He who reveals to the soul its necessity is waiting to satisfy its hunger and thirst. The cisterns will be emptied, the pools become dry; but our Redeemer is an inexhaustible fountain. We may drink, and drink again, and ever find a fresh supply. He in whom Christ dwells has within himself the fountain of blessing, - “a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” From this source he may draw strength and grace sufficient for all his needs (<em>Desire of Ages</em>, p. 187).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The Saviour is still carrying forward the same work as when He offered the water of life to the woman of Samaria. To every soul, however sinful, Jesus says, “If thou hadst asked of Me, I would have given thee living water.”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The gospel invitation is not to be narrowed down, and presented only to a select few, who, we suppose, will do us honor if they accept it. The message is to be given to all. To them, as to the woman at the well, He says, “I that speak unto thee am He.”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">He did not neglect the opportunity of speaking to one woman, though she was a stranger, an alien from Israel, and living in open sin.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Often He began His lessons with only a few gathered about Him, but one by one the passers-by paused to listen, until a multitude heard with wonder and awe the words of God. The worker for Christ should not feel that he cannot speak with the same earnestness to a few hearers as to a larger company. There may be only one to hear the message; but who can tell how far-reaching will be its influence? (<em>Desire of Ages</em>, p. 194).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;"><em>B. John 7:37-44, Last Day of the Feast</em></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">“If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.” If, with this promise before us, we choose to remain parched and withered for want of the water of life, it is our own fault. If we would come to Christ with the simplicity of a child coming to its earthly parents, and ask for the things that He has promised, believing that we receive them, we should have them (<em>Testimonies</em>, vol. 9, p. 179).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Jesus lifted up His voice, in tones that rang through the courts of the temple: “If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” The condition of the people made this appeal very forcible. They had been dazzled with light and color, and their ears regaled with the richest music; but there had been nothing in all this round of ceremonies to meet the wants of the spirit, nothing to satisfy the thirst of the soul for that which perishes not. Jesus invited them to come and drink of the fountain of life, of that which would be in them a well of water, springing up unto everlasting life.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">“If any man thirst, let him come unto Me.” The rich, the poor, the high, the low, are alike welcome. He promises to relieve the burdened mind, to comfort the sorrowing, and to give hope to the despondent. Many of those who heard Jesus were mourners over disappointed hope, many were nourishing a secret grief, many were seeking to satisfy their restless longing with the things of the world and the praise of men, but when all was gained, they found that they had toiled only to reach a broken cistern, from which they could not quench their thirst. The Holy Spirit presented the symbol before them until they saw in it the offer of the priceless gift of salvation.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going forth, and it appeals to us with even greater power than to those who heard it in the temple on that last day of the feast. The fountain is open for all. The weary and exhausted ones are offered the refreshing drought of eternal life. Jesus is still calling, “If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.” “Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” Rev. 22: 17, John 4: 14 (<em>Desire of Ages</em>, pp 453, 454.)</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;"><em>C. Exodus 17:6, Numbers 20:8, Smiting the Rock</em></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The flowing of the water from the rock in the desert was celebrated by the Israelites, after their establishment in Canaan, with demonstrations of great rejoicing. In the time of Christ this celebration had become a most impressive ceremony. It took place on the occasion of the Feast of Tabernacles, when the people from all the land were assembled at Jerusalem. On each of the seven days of the feast the priests went out with music and the choir of Levites to draw water in a golden vessel from the spring of Siloam. They were followed by multitudes of the worshipers, as many as could get near the stream drinking of it, while the jubilant strains arose, “With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Then the water drawn by the priests was borne to the temple amid the sounding of trumpets and the solemn chant “Our feet shall stand within thy gates oh Jerusalem.” The water was poured out upon the altar of burnt-offering, while songs of praise rung out, the multitudes joining in triumphant chorus with musical instruments and deep-toned trumpets (<em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, p.412).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The priest had that morning performed the ceremony which commemorated the smiting of the rock in the wilderness. That rock was a symbol of Him who by His death would cause living streams of salvation to flow to all who are athirst. Christ’s words were the water of life. There in the presence of the assembled multitude He set Himself apart to be smitten, that the water of life might flow to the world. In smiting Christ, Satan thought to destroy the Prince of life; but from the smitten rock there flowed living water. “Give me this water, that I thirst not” John 4:15 (<em>Desire of Ages</em>, p. 454).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Christ combines the two types. He is the rock, he is the living water. The same beautiful and expressive figures are carried throughout the Bible. Centuries before the advent of Christ, Moses pointed to him as the rock of Israel’s salvation; the psalmist sung of him as “my Redeemer,” “The rock of my strength,” “the rock that is higher than I,” “a rock of habitation,” “rock of my heart,” “rock of my refuge.”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">In David’s song his grace is pictured also as the cool, “Still waters,” amid green pastures, beside which the heavenly Shepherd leads his flock. Again, “Thou shalt make them,” he says, “drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life.” And the wise man declares, “The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook,” to Zechariah, “a fountain opened...for sin and for uncleanness.”</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">Isaiah describes him as the “rock of ages,” and “the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.” And he records the precious promise, bringing vividly to mind the living stream that flowed for Israel: “When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.” “I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground:” “in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.” The invitation is given, “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.” And in the closing pages of the sacred word this invitation is echoed. The river of the water of life, “clear as crystal,” proceeds from the throne of God and the Lamb; and the gracious call is ringing down through the ages, “Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely” (<em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, p. 413).</span><br>

                        <span style="line-height:13px;">We must know our real condition, or we shall not feel our need of Christ’s help. We must understand our danger, or we shall not flee to the refuge. We must feel the pain of our wounds, or we should not desire healing (<em>Christ’s Object Lessons</em>, p. 158).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;"><em>B.	Lessons from Cities of Refuge, Numbers 35:6-28</em></span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The cities of refuge appointed for God’s ancient people were a symbol of the refuge provided in Christ. The same merciful Saviour who appointed those temporal cities of refuge, has by the shedding of his own blood provided for the transgressors of God’s law a sure retreat, into which they may flee for safety from the second death. No power can take out of his hands the souls that go to him for pardon. “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.” “Who is he that condemeth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us;” that “we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us (<em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, pp 516, 517).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The Lord made provision to insure the safety of those who should take life unintentionally. Six of the cities assigned to the Levites - three on each side of the Jordan, were appointed as cities of refuge, to which the manslayer might flee for safety.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The cities of refuge were so distributed as to be within a half day’s journey of every part of the land. The roads leading to them were always to be kept in good repair; all along the way, sign-posts were to be erected bearing the word “Refuge” in plain, bold characters, that the fleeing one might not be delayed for a moment. Any person - Hebrew, stranger, or sojourner - might avail himself of this provision. But while the guiltless were not to be rashly slain, neither were the guilty to escape punishment. The case of the fugitive was to be fairly tried by the proper authorities, and only when found innocent of intentional murder was he to be protected in the city of refuge. The guilty were given up to the avenger. And those who were entitled to protection could receive it only on condition of remaining within the appointed refuge. Should one wander away beyond the prescribed limits, and be found by the avenger of blood, his life would pay the penalty of his disregard of the Lord’s provision. At the death of the high priest, however, all who had sought shelter in the cities of refuge were at liberty to return to their possessions (<em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, pp 515,516).</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">He who fled to the city of refuge could make no delay. Family and employment were left behind. There was no time to say farewell to loved ones. His life was at stake, and every other interest must be sacrificed to the one purpose - to reach the place of safety. Weariness was forgotten, difficulties were unheeded. The fugitive dared not for one moment slacken his pace until he was within the walls of the city.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The sinner is exposed to eternal death, until he finds a hiding-place in Christ. Just as loitering and carelessness might rob the fugitive of his only chance for life, so delays and indifference may prove the ruin of the soul. Satan, the great adversary, is on the track of every transgressor of God’s holy law, and he who is not sensible of his danger, and does not earnestly seek shelter in the eternal refuge, will fall a prey to the destroyer.</span><br>
                        <span style="line-height:13px;">The prisoner who at any time went outside the city of refuge was abandoned to the avenger of blood. Thus the people were taught to adhere to the methods which infinite wisdom appointed for their security. Even so, it is not enough that the sinner believe in Christ for the pardon of sin; he must, by faith and obedience, abide in him. “For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries” (<em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, p. 517).</span><br>

Know how ropes are made and demonstrate how to care for rope in the correct manner . Tie and know the practical use of the following knots: Overhand; Granny; Square; Slip; Double Bow; Two Half Hitches; Clove Hitch; Bowline .<br>
CLASS PERIODS: TWO<br>
                           <br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
                           <br>
To teach the value of a well-kept rope and how to become skillful in tying basic knots and to understand their uses.<br>
TEACHING METHODS<br>
                           <br>
A. Ropes<br>
Under primitive conditions, man has used vines, reeds, fibers, and leather thongs. These materials serve their purpose, but since the earliest civilizations there is evidence of the use of rather sophisticated ropes made from cotton, various woods, and other natural fiber materials.<br>
Today rope is made from Manila fibre, sisal fibre, or hemp. It is also made from nylon, plastic, and other synthetic materials, which are highly resistant to rot or mildew, but each type has peculiarities, however, which negate some uses. Instructors should become familiar with test strengths, flexibility, rope life, and other characteristics before putting rope to practical use.<br>
The best natural fibre rope is made from hemp. True hemp is rather scarce, so the better ropes we find on the market are made from Manila fibre. Sisal is only about two-thirds as strong as Manila. The best ropes when life is at risk are the specialized synthetic ropes.<br>
Rope is one of the most convenient materials for effecting temporary joints in many materials. It is also an essential item in camping, sailing, mountaineering, caving, and other outdoor activities.<br>
The life of a rope may be prolonged if it is properly used and cared for. Good rope care only involves following a few simple rules, which are:<br>
Keep ropes as dry as possible. Never store a rope when it is wet, especially if it is Manila or sisal. Dampness in these ropes leads to a weakening of the fibers. Natural drying in the sun is best. Oven drying is to be avoided as this will damage the fibers.<br>
Inspect ropes periodically for signs of damage along their length. A thorough examination will require you to look at the inside of the rope, as well as the outside. The inner fibers should stay bright and new in appearance.<br>
When not in use, coil a rope and keep it dry. A regular coil should be clockwise, or to the right, because of the natural twist in the rope. If the rope kinks when coiled, it is because a reverse twist has been given it while in use. To remove this, coil it counter-clockwise.<br>
Never step or walk on a rope that is laying on the ground.<br>
B. Knots<br>
The most efficient method of teaching knot tying is by:<br>
Demonstrating the procedure.<br>
Have the class follow the instructor, each using their own rope.<br>
Practice procedure until proficient.<br>
When more than one rope is involved in a knot, use ropes of different colors.<br>
To understand directions for knot tying, three definitions are first necessary:<br>
The standing part: the long part of the rope on which the individual works in forming the knot.<br>
The bight. Turning the rope back on itself forms a loop. This is known as a bight.<br>
The running end: the part with which the individual works.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#19171B;">The Overhand Knot - Make a bight, bring the end of the rope up through it, and draw it tight. This is a commonly used knot.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#19171B;">The Granny Knot - This knot is now widely used in first-aid bandaging in place of the square knot, which formerly was recommended. Make an overhand knot. Now make a second overhand, crossing the end over the standing part in the same way it was done before.<br>
The Square Knot - Never slips or jams, and is easy to untie. It should be used on all packages. Make an overhand knot. Now make a second overhand, crossing the end over the standing part in the opposite direction from the way it was done first. The beginner often thinks he is tying the second knot backward. Right over left, then left over right.<br>
The Slip Knot - The slipknot can be used to hitch a horse to a post. The knot slips, but if properly tied, becomes tighter the more the end is pulled. Make a bight, and instead of bringing the end up through it, as in the case of the overhand, bring a loop through.<br>
The Double Bow -&nbsp; (Not Shown) The common knot tied by all boys and girls every time they tie their shoelaces. It is so common that no drawing is necessary. It should follow the square knot principle and not the granny.<br>
Two Half Hitches - Useful because they are easily made and will not slip under any strain. Pass the rope through the ring and around the standing part, bringing it through the bight thus formed. Repeat as shown in diagram. Often used for tying ropes on a trailer or with a round turn for securing a tent rope to a peg.<br>
Clove Hitch - As the name suggests, this knot is used to fasten the end of a rope to a pole or fixed object and is used for commencing and ending the square lashing. Pass the rope around the pole so that the end with which you are working passed under the standing part. Pass the rope around the pole a second time, above the standing part, making a turn that brings the end through the loop in the opposite direction from the standing part.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#19171B;">Bowline - This is used for tying a person or an animal when it is important that the noose shall not become tight, as in lowering a person from a burning building, staking out an animal, etc., making a noose that neither slips nor jams. It is one of the most valuable of knots. Make a small bight on the standing part, leaving the end long enough to pass around the person or animal to be tied. Pass the end up through the bight around the standing part and down through the bight again. To tighten, hold the noose and pull the standing part.<br>
                           <br>
Additional Teaching Methods for Proficiency are:<br>
Use the knots in games.<br>
Make knot boards that can be added to as the juniors progress in their class work.3. Teach some knots as speed knots. (See Advanced Requirement #3.)<br>

Participate in an overnight campout .<br>
                           <br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
                           <br>
To help the juniors learn some of the practical out-of-doors camping skills and to develop an appreciation of the natural world.<br>
EXPLANATION<br>
                           <br>
God comes very close to a junior while he sits round a campfire or lies beneath a star-studded sky, so campouts are a great time for spiritual growth.<br>
Plan your spiritual activities before you go.<br>
Plan for your camp to be more than a recreational outing.<br>
Be familiar with the area.<br>
Prepare the site as much as possible the week before.<br>
This is a class, not a club activity.<br>
TEACHING METHOD<br>
                           <br>
The class under your guidance should be responsible for planning the camp program and also the menus. You pre-select two or three sites and then allow the class to choose the best location. The group should set up the camp and prepare and cook the meals.<br>

The inst</span><span style="color:#19171B;">ructional material in the following pages is designed to be used as helps in teaching the various aspects of safety.<br>
Where possible, invite guest speakers such as electricians, ambulance team members, lifesaving club members, a policeman or representative from the road safety council to lecture to the Friends.<br>
Films on “safety” are often available from film libraries.<br>
Set up mock situations to dramatize a problem. Discuss possible solutions. The more practical the subject, the more the juniors will enjoy it.<br>
WATER SAFETY<br>
Where to Swim<br>
Wherever you may be, never swim alone. A companion may save your life.<br>
Avoid all but the best known and safest swimming spots.<br>
The safest beach is the one<em> patrolled by</em> life guards.<br>
Young children should always be supervised by adults.<br>
When to Swim<br>
You should not swim for at least one hour after a meal, but as a hungry swimmer soon gets tired, swim well before the next meal is due.<br>
Do not enter the wa<em>ter immediat</em>ely after vigorous exercise.<br>
Swimming at night is very dangerous; if you go under, no rescuer could find you.<br>
Where Danger Lurks<br>
Never dive into strange water as there may be snags, rocks, broken glass, and rubbish on the bottom.<br>
Inflatable rubber toys are dangerous. An unexpec<em>ted current or bre</em>eze can carry these toys, and their passenger, away from shore in a matter of moments.<br>
Don’t get too cold, as this can bring on cramps.<br>
When surfing or swimming in surf, it is easy for the current, unknown to the swimmer, to gradually drag you away from the other bathers. Check your position frequently and stay close to the main group of bathers. •Where a beach is patrolled by life guards, never swim outside the marked areas – the life guards know the beach better than you. •On surf beaches, don’t swim in the area set aside for surf boarders. Many swimmers have been badly injured by surfboards.<br>
When in Difficulties<br>
The first rule is DON’T PANIC.<br>
An arm held straight up in the air is the recognized sign of a swimmer in distress.<br>
If caught in a current or undert<em>ow, do not try to sw</em>im against it - swim with it, and at the same time diagonally towards the shore.<br>
Learn how to tread water and float; exhaustion is the biggest danger to a swimmer in difficulties.<br>
When seized by a cramp, turn on your back, float, and shout for help.<br>
Throwing your arms about wildly will only make you sink.<br>
If caught in weeds (a common danger when swimming in rivers and water holes) don’t struggle; slow, gentle movements will free you more quickly.<br>
Protect Yourself and Others<br>
When at a swimming pool, watch where you jump, as it is very easy to injure someone else.<br>
If you get too far out from shore, you may have tr<em>ouble getting back and you </em>may invite danger from sharks.<br>
When in the water, play sensibly. “Dunking” and other foolish habits are both frightening and dangerous to beginners.<br>
Buoyant Aid Rescue•Always try to throw or push something out to the victim before attempting to rescue on your own. There are a number of articles you can use that wil<em>l keep the victim </em>afloat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
G.&nbsp; Throwing a Rescue Line<br>
Good throwing depends on the care you take in coiling and handling the line.<br>
Coil the turns alongside each other without crossing, worki</span><span style="color:#000000;">ng </span><span style="color:#19171B;">t<em>owards the tips of the fing</em>ers and turning it so that the free end is nearest the fingers.<br>
 Without disturbing the arrangement of the turns, transfer 2/3 of the coil to the throwing hand.&nbsp; <br>
When ready to throw, stand with the left shoulder towards the target </span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#19171B;">rea. Swing both arms together across the body (under arm) and throw with a good follow- through. Practice and a good follow-through right over the target are the secrets of hitting the target.<br>
ROAD SAFETY<br>
Look carefully in both directions before crossing the road and cross at right angles. You should not find it necessary to run.<br>
Do not cross the road behind or in front of a parked car. If you have to do this, be very careful.<br>
Use a pedestrian crossing where one is provided.<br>
Do not attempt to get on or off a moving vehicle.<br>
Always walk along a footpath or sidewalk instead of in the road.<br>
Where there is no footpath, walk on the side of the road that faces on-coming traffic.<br>
Always play in safe places, never on a road.<br>
BICYCLE SAFETY<br>
Learn to ride in your yard or at a nearby open area where riding is permitted. Don’t ride on the road until Mom or Dad say so.<br>
Avoid busy roads.<br>
Ride with the flow of the traffic, close to the curb.<br>
Watch for parked cars pulling out or doors opening suddenly.<br>
Never ride on the footpath.<br>
Obey all traffic signs and signals. (Remember, a bicycle is a vehicle)<br>
Stop, look, and listen before entering a road.<br>
Give correct hand signals for turning and stopping.<br>
Never double or carry another person on your bicycle. No large parcels.<br>
Never ride more than two abreast. Remember it’s much safer riding single file.<br>
Keep your bicycle in good condition.<br>
Keep your bicycle under control- no stunting.<br>
Have good lights for night riding; reflectors and bells may be compulsory.<br>
Wear a helmet.<br>
SAFETY IN THE HOME<br>
Electrical Don’ts<br>
Your Main Earth Wire - Every house MUST have a main earth or ground wire. The earth wire is usually connected to a water pipe or a metal rod driven in<em>to the ground. It</em> <em>is extremely importa</em>nt that this earth wire is properly secured and maintained. (Anything electrical is dangerous. This is a specialized area for experienced electricians only.)<br>
Overhead wires are dangerous - Keep impressing on children the danger of going near overhead wires. If a kite or other object lodges in overhead wires, tell children to<em> leave it there and let an a</em>dult get it. Be careful yourself - especially when painting or carrying out repairs near electrical poles and connections.<br>
Fallen Wires Are Dangerous - Remember the Safety Rules:<br>
Stand well clear.<br>
Stand guard and prevent other people approaching the wires.<br>
Send someone to call the electrici<em>ty department or police. E</em>ach broken wire has two ends - both may be alive.<br>
If You Don’t Know - Most electrical fatalities are caused by meddling with appliances, wrongly wired plugs, makeshift leads, homemade hand lamps. Be wise, play safe, an<em>d get a competent</em> electrician to do the job.<br>
Even a Slight Tingle - The slightest shock is your warning that something is wrong with an installation or appliance. Don’t ignore it! Immediately switch off the electr<em>icity and pull out t</em>he plug. Call your electrician or electricity department at once.<br>
Don’t Meddle with the Power Still on - Prying open points, attempting to adjust or repair any appliance or plug while it is still connected to the power point, is invit<em>ing disaster. You expose yourself to</em> great danger by meddling with electrical equipment. Disregard of elementary precautions is the cause of most accidents. Be wise and leave all repairs to your electrician.<br>
Power Appliance to a Light Socket - Moveable electrical appliances must be grounded. Never plug into a light socket or extend your lead with two core flex. Use only thr<em>ee-coreflex, wired correctly to a</em> three-pin plug and plugged into a grounded three-pin power point. If you are in doubt, ask your electrician or the electricity department.<br>
Faulty Electrical Installations<br>
Frayed or kinked cords, chipped or broken fittings, and makeshift joints are dangerous. Repair all damaged cords and fittings. To join f<em>lexible cords, use a three- pin</em> plug and cord extension socket.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Do not use damaged plug socket.NEVER cut electrical cords with scissors.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Incorrectly wired plug. Frayed electrical leads or plugs.<br>

PATHFINDER CLUB HALL SAFETY<br>
Inspect your Pathfinder Club meetin</em>g<em> place and list the th</em>i<em>ngs that might be dangerous. There are many situations that can be dangerous. </em>T<em>he place we live in, wh</em>ere we play, or our own hall can easily become a “hazard.”<br>
Here are ten points for you to look for in a meeting place. There could be many more. How does your hall rate?<br>
Objects left lying about can lead someone to fall over them. Put things away in their places, especially after you have used them.<br>
Broken or cracked glass or louvers in windows can easily cut someone.<br>
Are there any loose light fittings or broken switches? Are the correct fuses being used?<br>
If your hall has polished floors, watch any mats. They can cause an accident if they slip easily.<br>
Is the camping gear stacked correctly? Can it fall down off shelves? Are some things so high that you may injure yourself getting them out?<br>
What about fire extinguishers? Does your hall have any? If so, does everyone know how to use them? When were they last serviced by the fire authority? How about trying a fire drill?<br>
Objects on the wall at head height could cause you to injure yourself while playing a game.<br>
Have the camping lanterns or stoves been checked for leaks? Is there a ventilated place to store them?<br>
Are all fuel bottles, food containers, camping gear etc. suitably labeled so other users don’t get confused?<br>
The pot for heating water in the kitchen—can it be knocked over and scald someone?<br>

TEACHING METHODS<br>
                           <br>
TENTS<br>
Types of</span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;"> Tents: Most </span><span style="color:#19171B;">types of tents are based on simple geometrical patterns: the pyramid, the cone, the prism. When you are familiar with these designs, it becomes fairly easy for you to deci<em>de which kind </em>will suit you best.<br>
For lightweight camping, variations of the wall tent rank high in popularity. The lean-to is also good.<br>
                           <br>
Care of Tent:<br>
A. In Camp<br>
Level the ground for your tent.<br>
Remove all sharp rocks and fill in all holes or depressions. Otherwise, a tent pole or a boot heel may punch a hole in the floor.<br>
To </span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#19171B;">a<em>ve floor wear</em>,<em> many camp</em>ers carry an extra piece of canvas to use as a rug on the floor. It also makes cleaning the tent easy. Just roll up the canvas and shake it outside.<br>
Also, longer life for your tent can be had by placing pieces of plywood or cardboard under center pole and all bed legs.<br>
If it is very windy, collapse your tent for the day to protect it, particularly an umbrella tent. A sudden gust of wind may blow it down, break a pole, or tear the fabric.<br>
Watch for canvas shrinkage during a rain storm. At the first sign of a storm, you should loosen all guy ropes.<br>
B. At Home<br>
Never store a tent when wet.<br>
Before putting away, check tent for tears, missing grommets, worn ropes, etc.<br>
If waterproofing is needed, do it before storing.<br>
Make sure you store it i<em>n a dry pl</em>ace.<br>
Pitch and Strike a Tent Correctly:<br>
Pitching a tent means to set it up.<br>
Striking a tent means to take it down and properly store.<br>
It is easy to pitch a tent if there are half a dozen people to <em>help, but an experienced camper ca</em>n do it alone by following a simple routine.<br>
Even the best-pitched tent will sag eventually, so tighten the lines from time to time to keep the roof taut. During rain, on the other hand, slacken the lines deliberately to offset the shrinking of wet lines and tent materials.<br>
As an example, this is the procedure for one very common style of tent:<br>
                           <br>
CAMP BED<br>
For an overnight camping trip, prepare your bed at home before starting out. It does not have to be very elaborate. But if you are staying for awhile on the same site, the extra tim</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#19171B;"> you spend making a camp bed will be repaid by the added comfort you will have.<br>
Fold a square blanket with one layer under you and two on top.<br>
In cooler weather, you need at least two blankets. Fold first <br>
blanket with two layers under you. Then bring bottom up over <br>
your feet. Swing half of second blanket over you, and fold bottom <br>
under your legs.<br>

                              <br>
To teach Friends the basic </em>rules of hiking and the outdoor experience.<br>
TEACHING METHOD<br>
                           <br>
A h</span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">ike is not a </span><span style="color:#19171B;">walk. A walker may shuffle along all day, scarcely knowing where he’s going and coming home at night without knowing where he’s been. But a hiker steps along with a purpose in view. He knows where he is going and why. He keeps right on until he gets there, and when he comes home he is satisfied. Rules are made for the protection of all persons and they must be followed in order to have a safe, interesting, and there-by an enjoyable hike. Every club should have a set of rules to control a hike, and these may vary from group to group, but there are ten basic rules for hiking, and these are listed.<br>
The hike must be planned. You must make plans for the hike in advance. You must consider the interests and ability of the hikers with respect to the kind of hike (pack, night, etc.) and the pl<em>ace of the hike (the typ</em>e of country - hilly or flat, etc.) and also the expected weather conditions (hot, cold, raining, etc.). When planning, you must consider the length of the hike and the amount of time that each leg of the hike should take. This is a matter of experience. Also, when planning, you must plan a route, make a list of the items to be taken, and provide transportation if it is needed. The last thing to do when planning is to see that every hiker is fully informed concerning the nature of the hike, and the time and place of the meeting and returning. They should be made aware of the hiking rules, and any food, water, or equipment they should bring with them.<br>
A hike is not a race. The hiking party must be kept together. The pace of the party is determined by the slowest member. A steady pace with frequent rests is desirable. Experienced persons sho<em>uld be placed at the</em> lead and at the rear of the party, and there should be frequent communication between both persons.<br>
The hiker should have good health. This is not to say that asthmatics and diabetics, etc. should not go hiking. They can, provided they take along their medications and know how to use them, a<em>nd also have informed the hike le</em>ader of their condition. This rule also applies to people who are just getting over some sickness or who are “run down,” etc. We all know how a cold or the flu can sap a person’s energy. People in these conditions should withdraw from the hike.<br>
The hiker must carry a first-aid kit. Each hiker should carry a small personal first-aid kit. It should consist of band aids, antiseptic cream, needle, tweezers, etc. In addition to personal f<em>irst-aid kits, a group kit should be</em> taken. This kit should consist of extras as in the personal kit, plus slings, roller bandages, pins, etc.<br>
Wear the correct clothing. The type of clothing will depend upon the weather and the type of country. Hats are always a must for hiking. Depending upon the duration of the hike, warm and wet w<em>eather clothes, even in w</em>arm weather, should be taken. Wear something white if hiking at night.<br>
Wear the correct footwear. Your feet make it possible for you to hike, so give them the care they deserve. Choose the right shoes. They should be smooth inside and fit snugly in the heel, but <em>with plenty of room for t</em>he toes to wriggle. Thick woolen socks are the best. Woolen because they keep you warm even when wet, and also because they give padding. Many hikers wear two pairs of socks, a woolen pair and a nylon pair next to the skin. Blisters, while still in the red stage, should be protected with a band aid. Protect fully-formed blisters by building a ring of cotton around them or applying a plaster. Although it is not correct to do under normal events, some hikers break the fully formed blisters and let out the fluid, then apply some antiseptic and a band aid.<br>
The hiker should carry navigation equipment. Each hiker should carry a map, with the hiking route marked, and a compass on every hike. Each hiker should know exactly where they are on the map <em>at all times.<br>
The hiker should obey all saf</em>ety rules. Some of the safety rules are as follows: Drink only water that is known to be pure. Walk facing the on-coming traffic. Go in single file if you must wal<em>k near a road. Hitch-hiking is forbidd</em>en.<br>
The hiker is always courteous and cheerful. Respect all “NO TRESPASSING,” “KEEP OFF,” and “PRIVATE” signs. Always get the owner’s permission before crossing private land. He’ll probably apprec<em>iate your asking him and be very cooperati</em>ve. He could have you arrested otherwise. Check your rest areas for paper and other litter before moving on.<br>
The hiker “goes all the way”. Every hiker wants to go all the way, and every hiker can. Start out slowly, even if you feel like a just-launched rocket. The fellow who starts out like a jet fre<em>quently comes home like a to</em>rtoise, ashamed that someone else is carrying his pack.<br>
Sometimes things go wrong, even with the best made plans, and you may get lost. By following a few simple rules, this need not be as serious as it seems. Every group should have a code or set of rules that each member knows thoroughly. This will enable others to know just what a person is going to do in case he does get lost and will enable them to find him more easily.<br>
The things that you do when lost are:<br>
Sit down and think, don’t panic. You will think of many fearful things like being attacked by a wild animal or slowly dying of starvation. Most people think such thoughts during the first anxi<em>ous moments after they realize </em>they don’t know where they are. But suppress them as quickly as you can, for they are foolish. You are certain to be found. <br>
Force yourself to sit still until you can think clearly. Don’t try to remember details, but general landmarks. Work out whether it would be better to go on, go back, or stay put. If you have food and water, it will probably be better to stay put and try and attract attention with a fire - a smoky fire during the day and a blazing fire at night.<br>
2.Pray. Kneel down and talk to God. Remember some of His promises: “I am with you always.” “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.” Jesus is watchin<em>g ov</em>er you. The angels are taking care of you.<br>
3.Mark the spot where you are at the moment. Don’t move from the point where you are until you mark it well. Blaze a tree, place a rag on a stick in the ground, or put your hat on a stump. Do so<em>mething to mark your spot. This will aid </em>searchers when looking for you if you move on.<br>
4.Climb a tree or hill. From the top you may see a landmark that you recognize. If so, and you are sure which way to go to get you back safely, proceed towards that landmark. But if you are not <em>sure of any landmark</em>s, STAY WHERE YOU ARE. At the same time, when you are up at your high point, look for smoke. This usually means people are there.<br>
5.Use your map and compass. You should have a map and compass in your pack-use them. Spread out the map and orient it, either with the compass or by checking the landmarks. <br>
Think of the last la<em>ndmark you passed. That </em>bridge, perhaps an old cabin, a hill, a sharp turn in the trail. Find it on the map. With your compass mark out a route, to the recognized landmark on your map. Follow the compass to the recognized landmark. Again, if you are not sure completely where the landmark is on the map, or you are not sure how to use the map and compass, STAY WHERE YOU ARE.<br>
6.STAY WHERE YOU ARE. If you are unable to locate a familiar landmark that can lead you home either by sight or by map and compass, STAY WHERE YOU ARE. Wait for help to come. Listen for the call<em>s of searchers. Co</em>llect enough wood to build a signal fire and to last you through the night if required. If you have to leave the position for some reason, such as shelter or water, etc. mark clearly the direction in which you have gone, and mark clearly the trail as you move.<br>
7.Light a fire. Build a safe fire. Have enough wood on hand to keep it going all night if required. During the day, once the fire is established, add green leaves to create smoke. Send your own <em>smoke signal</em>s. At night, keep the fire burning bright; it will create warmth and also the glow will attract attention. Keep an eye on your fuel as you may need it later.<br>
8.Give out distress signals. The following are some search and rescue signals:<br>
Distress Signals by Lost Party:<br>
Three signals together, regularly spaced.<br>
Searchers Looking for Lost Party:<br>
One sig<em>nal at irregular interval</em>s.<br>
Acknowledgment of Distress Signal:<br>
Searchers will give one signal.<br>
Recall Signal:<br>
Two signals at short intervals, followed by a minute without, and then repeated.<br>
Form of Signals:<br>
These may be given by smoke, i.e. blanketing a smoky fire, or by shouts, shots, whistles, flashing of mirror or torch, or by distinctive waving of cloth. The chief characteristic of these signals is their regularity, and any signal repeated at any regular interval should be investigated.<br>

                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">A story of the parable of the lost sheep, or of the childhood of Jesus (the visit to the Temple at age 12) would be especially suitable for this group.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>ACTIVITIES<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">• Sing a song about Jesus<br>
Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft, one activity, and one discussion on the topic that the children have learnt about Jesus <br>
• Prepare a sheet or blanket tent<br>
Bring oversized T-shirts and head scarves so the children can dress up as in Bible times. Encourage the children to take off their shoes and socks, and pretend to cook, or watch their sheep etc. Or just do dress up letting the children try different ideas, and let them suggest the kinds of toys Jesus might have played with (hint - his father was a carpenter so there would have been wood scraps).<br>
• Play Simon Sa</span><span style="color:#000000;">ys using the term the Shepherd ins</span><span style="color:#231F20;">tead of Simon<br>
Draw an outline of a lamb, and prepare pictures of shepherds. Let the children glue cotton wool onto the lamb picture. While they are working or in a de-brief afterward discuss how a shepherd deals with a lost lamb and how Jesus deals with us when we wander from the way he wants us to go.<br>
• With paddlepop sticks and white glue let the children build flat topped Bible land houses. <br>
Talk about the fact that Jesus was a carpenter.<br>
This is an Iranian game that can be played sitting in a circle, and could easily be the type of game that Jesus played with his friends. The children sit in a circle with a leader. The leader does an action and the children take turns round the circle copying the action (pull a face, tug on ear or nose, stroke the hair of the person next to you, etc). In the original game anyone who laughed or made a giggle or a noise was out, but let the children stay in though trying to exercise self-control.<br>

about Creation.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Senses<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Bring a variety of plants that are safe to touch and smell, especially ones with strong scents or unusual textures. Let the children touch and smell and discuss them.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Rain using rainsticks (cardboard tubes with the ends sealed, with beans or rice inside. Thunder, drum sticks on a chair. Brook (a bottle with some water, then blow into it with a straw. Varying the level of the water varies the sound). Record and play back the children making lambs bleating, lions roaring, wind blowing etc.<br>
On a large piece of paper draw round the bare feet of the children. Show them how to change these outlines into fishes.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Land and Sea<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Having a sand tray and a tub of water (preferably outside), let the children experiment as to what they can make in the sand. What will float or sink, and the volume of unusual shaped containers by measuring water from one to another.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Rock hunt<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Hide polished or unusual rocks either inside or outside. Have the children hunt for the rocks. Discuss about the rocks with the Adventurers.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Rock varieties<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Use a magnifying glass to look at the texture of different rocks. Scrape the rocks with a nail to see the different hardness of rocks. Weigh rocks of the same size but different densities on scales. If you can find some lava (pumice), drop it into water and show that some rocks float. Have cardboard boxes with different sized holes cut in the top. Let the children sort the rocks by size using the different sized holes.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">Rock sculptures<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Glue small rocks to containers of cardboard or plastic, or other larger rocks. Encourage the Pre-Adventurers to make sculptures.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Sing a song about families. eg. ‘With Jesus in the family, happy, happy home’<br>
Listen to a story about families.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Say three things you’ve learned about families.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Make a craft about families.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

                        </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">TEACHING SUGGESTIONS<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>STORY<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">Find a story about a family. Bible stories could be of Adam &amp; Eve, with Cain &amp; Abel; Noah’s family; Joseph or David and their brothers. A story of a modern family would be just as good. Remember modern families do not all have mothers and fathers, so include grandparents, uncles, aunts, siblings etc. Remind the children that we are all part of the family of Jesus.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>ACTIVITIES<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">Here is an action rhyme that could be used for the song about families.<br>
There are all kinds of families I see, Some are two and some are three (hold up two then three fingers) Some are eight and some are four (change the number of fingers showing) And some are more and more and more! (Raise and lower all 10 fingers.)<br>
Do four activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft and one activity, plus one discussion on the things the children have learnt about families. Here are three suggestions.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Play house. <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Hang sheets from a clothes line to make walls, have a dress up box, bits of furniture (TV, phone, and other props). Have the children act out different members of a family.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Family Tree. <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Draw an outline of a tree with large leaves. Each child will need to go to an adult to place names of the people in their family on their tree. Make sure the child’s name is on one of the leaves. (Nanna, Mummy, Daddy are suitable names, you do not have to use first names etc).<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">• Family matching. <br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Find pictures of parents, grand-parents, children etc (two of each!). On index cards, make 16 to 20 cards in a pack with 8 to 10 pairs of pictures. Have an adult with two to three children, to supervise playing game and discuss about families. Spread cards out face down, turn up two cards, if they match the child keeps them. As the child takes a matching pair ask what family member would this be (mother, sister etc). The NAD manual suggests www.gettyimages.com but going to Google, and selecting images, the father, mother, boy girl etc may be quicker.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Sing a song about the body. eg ‘Head bone is connected to the neck bone...’<br>
Listen to a story about the body.<br>
Say three things you've learned about bodies.<br>
Make a craft about bodies.<br>
Complete an activity about bodies.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">TEACHING SUGGESTIONS<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>STORY<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">Ask questions about their bodies (what do you smell with? what do you hear with? Etc). Then read a story about the parts of their bodies, and sing the action song Head shoulders, knees and toes (see http://w3.gorge.net/cannon/songs22.html - about half way down the screen). Or talk about how each of us is different and we all have something we are special at, and read a story about children who were special, (either especially skilled or even handicapped) bodies.<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;"><em>ACTIVITIES<br>
                           </em></span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one craft, one activity, and one discussion on the things the children have learned about their bodies.<br>
• You will need big sheets of white paper, plus oddments of crayons, buttons, scraps and paste. First have each child lie on the big sheet and draw round them (they do not have to lie out flat). Then let them decorate the outline of themselves, with colours, scraps etc. (NB - Observe what, how &amp; where the decorations go)<br>
• Name game, stand in a circle, name a child and bounce the ball to them, they return it. Make sure to give each child a turn and name them.<br>
• Make a sheet of paper for each child with their name outlined in dots. Let them trace in the name and decorate the paper with colours, glitter etc.<br>
• Paper bag puppets. You will need crayons, paper bags, hair coloured pieces of wool (long and short), and some buttons. Show one you have made then let the children glue on the hair with buttons for eyes, draw in mouth, nose etc. They do not have to use their own hair colouring.<br>
• Unique Me. Weigh each child and measure their height. Have them blow into a balloon to see how big they can go on one breath. Take a finger print and let them look at it through a magnifying glass. Taste samples of fruits and vegetables and record which they liked best. Record their voices (in advance) and let the group guess the names of the voices.<br>
• I can be . . . Collect pictures of firemen, nurses, police, chefs, artists, builders, veterinarians, etc, etc. together with symbolic clothes for each. Let the children choose and dress up.<br>

                           </em>STORY<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Tell a story about Bible friends. Try to pick a story where there is friendship between the individual and God, and the individual and other people (or for example in the case of Noah between him and the animals, Moses and God, Paul and God, little servant girl and God, etc).<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#2F5496;">ACTIVITIES<br>
                        </span><span style="color:#231F20;">Do four of the following (or your own) activities in the Lamb Frolic time, including at least one song, one game and one craft, all about their Bible friends.<br>
• A suggestion that would suit the story of Noah would be to have each child chose a colour of paint to place on their hand. Then each child places their colour on their own and everyone else in their group’s piece of paper, to make rainbows.<br>
• Three legged obstacle course. Beware some small children will not have enough coordination to work with another child and will need to be paired with an adult. Lay out a route around obstacles in the room and have them co-operate as friends to get around the course.<br>
• Song - The Farmer in the Dell. See http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/farmer.htm for the words and music (there is a lot of other useful material on the kids section of this site).<br>
• Everyone forms a circle with one adult in the middle, each time the song is sung the last person to go to the middle calls another person by name to join them until all the children are in the middle.<br>
• Song - If you’re happy and you know it. Adapt the words of the song at </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/happand.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"> , use the word “friendly” instead of happy, and some of the actions can</span><span style="color:#000000;"> be modified to types of greetings. Song - Jesus is a Friend of Mine (action point to self) and for the last line sing “And He is -----&gt;s friend too using the name of another child. Use the music for Mary </span><span style="color:#231F20;">had a little lamb - </span><span style="color:#000000;">http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/mary.htm</span><span style="color:#231F20;"><br>
• Bible Friends dress up. Dress up in Bible style clothing. In the Good-baa Little Lambs time, havet each child name a Bible friend.<br>

Counting and Number Recognition<br>
                           </strong><br>
Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to count objects from 1 to 10, recognize and identify numbers from 1 to 10, and associate numerals with their written form.<br>
                           <br>
Duration: 45 minutes<br>
                           <br>
Materials: <br>
- Number cards (1-10)<br>
- Counting objects (e.g., small toys, blocks, or pictures)<br>
- Whiteboard and markers<br>
                           <br>
Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by discussing what counting is. Explain that counting is the process of determining the quantity of items.<br>
2. Introduce the concept of numbers as symbols that represent quantities. Show them a number card (e.g., &quot;1&quot;) and explain that it represents one item.<br>
3. Emphasize the importance of numbers in our daily lives, such as when we tell time or count items.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 1: Counting Objects (10 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute a set of objects (toys, blocks, etc.) to each student.<br>
2. Ask the students to count the objects in their set, starting from 1 and going up to 10.<br>
3. Encourage them to say the numbers aloud as they count the objects.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 2: Number Recognition (10 minutes):<br>
1. Show the students a number card (e.g., &quot;3&quot;).<br>
2. Ask them to identify the number and show that many fingers.<br>
3. Repeat this with several number cards, gradually increasing the complexity.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 3: Matching Numbers and Objects (10 minutes):<br>
1. Place a random number of objects (1-10) on a table.<br>
2. Show the students a number card and ask them to find the corresponding number of objects on the table.<br>
3. This activity reinforces the association between numbers and quantities.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 4: Writing Numerals (5 minutes):<br>
1. Have the students practice writing numerals on their individual whiteboards.<br>
2. Start with simpler numbers like 1 and 2 and gradually progress to more complex numbers.<br>
3. Encourage them to write the numerals neatly.<br>
                           <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the lesson by revisiting what counting is and how numbers represent quantities.<br>
2. Remind students to practice counting and recognizing numbers in their daily activities.<br>
3. Distribute number cards or worksheets for additional practice at home.<br>
                           <br>
Homework:<br>
- Provide a worksheet with pictures of objects and ask the students to count them and write the corresponding numerals.<br>
                           <br>
Assessment:<br>
- Monitor students' participation in activities and check their homework for understanding of counting and number recognition.<br>
                           <br>
Adaptations:<br>
- For students with special needs, provide additional visual aids or one-on-one support during activities.<br>
- For advanced students, introduce numbers beyond 10 and challenge them with more complex counting activities.<br>

                           <br>
Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Begin by introducing the concept of counting forward and backward using a number line.<br>
2. Explain that a number line is a visual tool with numbers placed at equal intervals. It helps us see the order of numbers.<br>
3. Show the large number line chart and point out that 1 is on the left end, and numbers increase as you move to the right.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 1: Counting Forward (15 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute small number lines to each student. These should have the numbers 1 to 20 printed on them.<br>
2. Ask students to stand in a circle and start at number 1.<br>
3. One by one, have each student say the next number in the sequence, continuing up to 20. Encourage them to use their number lines for reference.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 2: Counting Backward (15 minutes):<br>
1. Using the whiteboard, draw a simple number line from 10 to 1.<br>
2. Explain that counting backward is like going in the opposite direction on the number line.<br>
3. Have the students take turns saying the numbers in reverse order, starting from 10 and ending at 1.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 3: Number Line Exploration (5 minutes):<br>
1. Show the large number line chart again and ask students to point to different numbers.<br>
2. Ask them questions like, &quot;What comes after 7?&quot; or &quot;What's two numbers before 15?&quot;<br>
3. This activity reinforces their understanding of the number line's organization.<br>
                           <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the lesson by reviewing the key points about counting forward and backward on a number line.<br>

Subtracting Single-Digit Numbers<br>
                           </strong><br>
Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to subtract single-digit numbers from 0 to 9, practice subtraction facts, and understand that subtraction is not commutative.<br>
                           <br>

                           <br>
Introduction (5 minutes):<br>
1. Start by explaining the concept of subtraction. Emphasize that subtraction is the opposite of addition, where we find the difference between two numbers.<br>
2. Discuss the importance of understanding that subtraction is not commutative, meaning the order matters.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 1: Subtraction Facts (15 minutes):<br>
1. Show number flashcards one at a time (e.g., 5) and ask the students to call out the subtraction facts for that number (e.g., 5 - 0, 5 - 1, 5 - 2, etc.).<br>
2. Discuss how these subtraction facts represent different ways to subtract from the same number.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 2: Hands-On Subtraction (15 minutes):<br>
1. Distribute a set of counters or small objects to each student.<br>
2. Demonstrate subtraction with a simple problem, e.g., 7 - 3. Start with 7 counters and &quot;take away&quot; 3, counting what's left.<br>
3. Have students practice subtracting different numbers using their counters.<br>
                           <br>
Activity 3: Commutative Property (10 minutes):<br>
1. Write a subtraction problem on the whiteboard, e.g., 6 - 2.<br>
2. Explain that subtraction is not commutative, so 6 - 2 is not the same as 2 - 6. Write 2 - 6 on the board and show that it results in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context.<br>
3. Emphasize that the order of numbers matters in subtraction.<br>
                           <br>
Conclusion (5 minutes):<br>
1. Summarize the lesson by reviewing the key points: subtracting single-digit numbers, practicing subtraction facts, and understanding the non-commutative nature of subtraction.<br>
2. Reinforce that subtraction helps us find differences or solve problems like &quot;How much is left?&quot;<br>

Keeping these purposes and values in mind, teachers and leaders will<br>
have opportunity to observe the Pathfinder's developing theological<br>
concepts and behavioral responses. This will help guide the leaders in<br>
their teaching, in their relationships with the Pathfinders, and in the<br>
selection of creative activities to effect successful learning experiences.<br>

2. Teaching the Pathfinder Curriculum Creatively<br>
The Pathfinder Curriculum will be taught to the Pathfinders when they meet<br>
together as a whole club, or as they work together as a unit or in classes.<br>
There will also be times when Pathfinders will need to study mate rial by<br>
themselves.<br>
Teachers will therefore recognize that it will be important to assess each<br>
Pathfinder, cach group of Pathfinders, each requirement, the physical<br>
surroundings where teaching takes place, and a whole range of further factors<br>
that lead to the successful transfer of knowledge.<br>
It is important to remember that the overall aim of teaching the curriculum is<br>
to allow the Pathfinders to develop an appropriate attitude toward further<br>
learning. This will take place best when teachers make efforts to bring about<br>
the right atmosphere for learning in the place of teaching. Learning takes place<br>
best when:<br>
a. It's a time for fun<br>
Pathfinders will learn to love the things they enjoy doing, and enjoyment<br>
stems from happy surroundings. If the teacher is overly stern and<br>
demanding, or constantly finding fault, learning will become a burden. If<br>
there's no place for humor and laughter; if the Pathfinders are always being<br>
told to remain quiet, to sit and listen, and there is no sense of adventure<br>
and learning, the experience will be of little value.<br>
b. It's a time for acceptance and understanding<br>
.(75 min.)<br>
Pathfinders will be more re ady to show interest in info rmation and learn<br>
values from the instructor if they feel accepted and understood.<br>
Acceptance stems from recognition of the Pathfinders' worth and value,<br>
and the knowledge that their behavior is their best attempt to deal with<br>
their current thoughts, feelings, and situation. This may not mean that<br>
their behavior is acceptable, but that they are accepted as people.<br>
Nothing can take away the value of each person to God, and all people<br>
C. I's a time for recognition and creativity<br>
will respond best when they are accepted as important and worthwhile.<br>
Likewise, it is important to understand each Pathfinder. Become familiar<br>
with why the youth does behave in a certain way, and while you may not<br>
approve of his or her lifestyle, you can at least attempt to understand. It<br>
is important to convey to all Pathfinders a genuine acceptance and<br>
understanding.<br>
d. It's a time for imagination and creativity<br>
Pathfinders will be encouraged in their learning when instructors take<br>
the time to give genuine praise and affirmation. Pathfinders need<br>
recognition for their best efforts, and instructors can do much to lead<br>
them on in their search for knowledge by sincere and honest rewards.<br>
125<br>
Instructors need to give urgent study to this aspect of teaching. So many<br>
good clas ses fail because of lack of imagination and variety. Creativity is<br>
really essential in teaching Pathfinders. In an age where much<br>
e. It's a time for effective communication<br>
in formation is transfe rred through the medium of TV, any straight talk<br>
may well appear slow, boring, and unattractive. Successful instructors<br>
will put time and energy into discovering a whole range of ways of<br>
doing some task differently. They may choose film and discussion, role<br>
play, drama, puppetry, collage, anything other than what is expected!<br>
Pathfinders enjoy surprises; they enjoy change; they enjoy variety. Call on<br>
all the re sources you have at hand. Then have another look, and find<br>
some more. Go all out to make every class the most interesting one you<br>
have attempted.<br>
f. It's a time for fairne ss and justice<br>
Learning will also take place best if the Pathfinders recognize that they are<br>
being listened to. They will learn to appreciate their worth as they discover<br>
that their instructor considers their answers worthwhile – that the<br>
instructor shows approval of their attempts at understanding the material.<br>
The Pathfinders will feel more accepted where there's no sarcasm or put-<br>
down, and where there is a sense of honesty and trust.<br>
g. It's a time for involvement<br>
Pathfinders are quick to notice partiality, unfairness, or favoritism.<br>
Instructors will need to be conscious of the need to be equal in praise and<br>
discipline.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Instructors should seek to involve the class as much as possible. View the<br>
class as the teachers: allow them to lead out in different segments get<br>
them doing something! Seek dialogue with the class to see how they are<br>
enjoying working on a particular requirement, and review with them what<br>
h. It's time for constant assessment<br>
Constantly evaluate the work you are doing and check to see if you are<br>
reaching and achieving the goals you set for yourself and the class. There<br>
are many factors that will affect the success of your class, including simple<br>
details such as the physical setting for the place of learning. Are there too<br>
many distractions? Is the seating arrangement too restrictive? Is the room<br>
too hot or too cold? Is there not enough light, or too much noise? Have<br>
they just come in from loud, fast-moving games, and haven't yet settled<br>
down? Keep an eye on all these things - they are worth checking.<br>
i. It's a time for cooperation<br>
Teaching a particular class will best happen when done in association with<br>
the overall plans of the club. A coordinated program will be needed for each<br>
Pathfinder event, and instructors, staff members, and the direc tor will work<br>
well together when all are aware of what the program times are.<br>
Special Teaching Arrangements<br>
In special cases, provision can be made for isolated Pathfinders to participate<br>
in the program apart from the Pathfinder organization. Likewise, provision<br>
can be made for the physically handicapped and the disadvan taged. Contact<br>
your local conference youth ministries personnel to work out details for<br>
exceptions.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Teaching Methods<br>
No attempt has been made here to set out every detail of teaching methods.<br>
Each class requirement will require a different approach, depending on factors<br>
such as time of day, place, number of participants, availability of resources, and<br>
similar factors. Wherever possible, instructors should plan several alternative<br>
teaching methods for each requirement, and use the one best suited to the<br>
group and the occasion. Before setting out to teach a class, teachers would do<br>
well to consider the following:<br>
1. Study the class curriculum<br>
Teachers are encouraged to be familiar with the overall direction of the<br>
Pathfinder curriculum. Study the flow chart found in the training<br>
manuals, which outline the development of the selected areas of study.<br>
Become very aware of the place your particular class has in the overall<br>
scheme of the program.<br>
Then become familiar with the particular class requirements for the class<br>
of Pathfinders that you will have under your care (Friend, Companion<br>
etc.). Become aware of what is expected of the Pathfinders; know what<br>
the requirement is asking for. Make sure you understand the stated<br>
objective for the requirement, and then familiarize yourself with the<br>
resource material.<br>
Assess the number and needs of vour class<br>
Get to know details about the members of your Pathfinder class. Who are<br>
they, what are their learning abilities, and what are their attitudes to the<br>
particular subjects? Are there any Pathfinders in your group who require<br>
extra help in learning information? Could there be problems in the<br>
particular methods you choose to teach the class?<br>
3. Work out your teaching plan<br>
Instructors will need to develop a suitable teaching plan based on<br>
the following:<br>
a. The total number of 30-minute periods required to teach the class<br>
b. The number of 30-minute periods required to teach each section of<br>
the Classwork (Bible search, camping etc.)<br>
c. The alternative teaching methods available for teaching each<br>
requirement<br>
d. The particular time and place when you will be teaching the<br>
requirement<br>
e. The availability of additional resources and background material<br>
127<br>
f. The method of evaluation to be used when the requirement is<br>
completed<br>
they have learned.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
PATHFINDER CLASSES<br>
In considering the Pathfinder program, there are many areas in which<br>
one should become involved in order to guide the development ofa<br>
well-to unded Pathfinder.<br>
Pathfinder Classwork<br>
&quot;The children are to be trained to become missionaries; they must be<br>
helped to understand distinctly what they must do to be saved' Counsels to<br>
Parents, Teachers, and Students, p. 168. And the best preparation is the<br>
&quot;harmonious development of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual<br>
powers. It prepares the student for the joy of service in this world, and for<br>
the higher joy of wider service in the world to come&quot; (Education, p. 13).<br>
&quot;Since both men and women have a part in homemaking, boys as well as<br>
girls should gain a knowledge of household duties. To make a bed and put<br>
a room in order, to wash dishes, to prepare a meal, to wash and repair his<br>
own clothing, is a training that need not make any boy less manly; it will<br>
make him happier and more useful. And if girls, in turn, could learn<br>
use the saw and the hammer, as well as the rake and the hoe, they would<br>
be better fitted to meet the emergencies of life Education, pp. 216-217).<br>
tc<br>
It was from the study of this and other similar messages that the Pathfinder<br>
Classes were developed, and all the requirements for these classes are based<br>
on this instruction. They include, therefore, Bible and nature study, the<br>
learning of useful and helpful things to do about the home, out-of-door<br>
activities, first aid, personal and home hygiene, physical fitness, and service<br>
to others.<br>
All of this helps the youth to find true happiness in witnessing and to become<br>
a member of a great army of Adventist youth whose talents and energies are<br>
committed to Christ. They will be those whose hands are ready to grasp any<br>
emergency and turn it to the glory of the great Master Guide. The Pathfinder<br>
Classes include Friend, Companion, Explorer, Ranger, Voyager, and Guide.<br>
Pathfinder Classes and School1<br>
128<br>
Onc of thc main objcctives of the Pathfindcr Club is to prcparc the youth<br>
for life with its emergencies and help the youth to become useful to both<br>
God and man. The Pathfinder class program has been established with this<br>
in mind. It therefore seems important to guide the Pathfinder into this<br>
program of self-improvement.<br>
Since the club director has the responsibility to oversee the completion of all<br>
Pathfinder class requirements where the church operates a school, the<br>
director should go the school and make arrangements to work with the<br>
teachers in the Glasswork, then continue to keep in touch with the teachers<br>
to confirm the Pathfinders' progress. All Investiture services are to be<br>
arranged by the Pathfinder Club director with the area<br>
Pathfinder Advanced Classes<br>
Where there is a church and a school dealing with many of the same<br>
Pathfinder age children/youth, the Path finder Club and the schoolteacher<br>
should work closely together in helping the Pathfinders finish their class<br>
requirements. The school might sponsor memory work and reading the<br>
required books; the club could help with the skill requirements. The school<br>
can easily help the Pathfinder get a needed Honor in connection with regular<br>
Classwork. Then the club can help in getting other Honors that are hard for<br>
the school to complete. Among the most difficult requirements to complete<br>
are the swimming skills, important skills that all should enjoy. The ability to<br>
handle oneself in water in an emergency could be the means of saving a life.<br>
The club may take the initiative and arrange for swimming lessons during the<br>
year so that this requirement can be completed.<br>
The Advanced Class levels are based on outdoor skills. These levels are best<br>
suited to the Pathfinder Club. To be able to enjoy the out-o f-doors and to be<br>
129<br>
able to meet emergencies are good reasons why these skills should be taught<br>
by every club.<br>
coordinator/conference youth director.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
AY Honors<br>
&quot;As a rule, the exercise most beneficial to the youth will be found in useful<br>
employment. The little child finds both diversion and development play;<br>
and his sports should be such as to promote not only physical, but mental<br>
and spiri tual growth. As he gains strength and intelligence, the best<br>
recreation will be found in some line of effort that is useful. That which<br>
trains the hand to helpfulness, and teaches the young to bear their share of<br>
life's burdens, is most effective in promoting the growth of mind and<br>
character. ... it is essential for every youth to have a thorough acquaintance<br>
During the Pathfinder years youth love to work on AY Honors and to display<br>
them after they have been earned.<br>
Tips for Maintaining Enthusiasm for Pathfinder Honors<br>
1. Have a definite date for completion. When the class is started, plan to<br>
finish the work within that time period. This gives the student that<br>
enthusiasm needed to know that the class is moving along and going some<br>
place. Ifit goes over into the next period, interest will wane and it will be<br>
harder to complete.<br>
2. Make the classwork worthwhile. If interest is to be kept at a high level the<br>
classwork must not only be fun but also informative and helpful. If<br>
requirements are glossed over lightly the student gets the idea that the<br>
Honor doesn't mean much. Before receiving the Honor a test should be<br>
given so that it can be seen that the person knows the answer to all<br>
questions. The Pathfinder must do all the requirements. A class notebook<br>
is helpful in keeping up interest, and it also gives the student something<br>
to take home that can be a source of reference in the work accomplished.<br>
It also helps parents feel that the child is really getting something<br>
worthwhile.<br>
3. Waiving requirements. In some of the class requirements there may be<br>
something that cannot be done your area. No club may decide that a<br>
certain re quirement cannot be met and therefore unilate rally waive the<br>
requirement. The conference/mission youth director must be notified<br>
and approve of any change in the published requirements. When this<br>
approval has been given in writing, the club is then free to change or<br>
waive the requirement as instructed.<br>
4. Meeting Path finder Honor requirements. The following guidelines will<br>
serve in checking Pathfinder Honor requirements.<br>
a. The work must actually be performed. Each question must be<br>
answered correctly and each requirement must have been met. Honors<br>
should not be given on the idea that the person could easily do the<br>
requirement.<br>
b. All Honors must be signed for by the instructor, conference youth<br>
director, Master Guide, Pathfinder Club director, or church-school<br>
teacher on the special form provided by the conference.<br>
5. Encourage each Pathfinder to aim at Master Awards. Pathfinder<br>
Honors are categorized into the following groups:<br>
Arts and Crafts<br>
Health and Science<br>
Household Arts<br>
Nature<br>
Outdoor Industries<br>
Outreach<br>
Recreation<br>
Vocation<br>
130<br>
A Pathfinder may earn a MASTER AWARD by completing seven<br>
Honors in a given category. After completion of the seven Honors in one<br>
category, the Pathfinder should inform the Path finder director, who will<br>
contact the conference youth ministries director to secure the Master<br>
Award patch. Like the Pathfinder Honors, the Master Award is presented<br>
preferably at a club meeting, campout, school, church, or Investiture. For<br>
additional information and a complete list of Honors see the Path finder<br>

6. Investiture Services.<br>
It is the responsibility of the Pathfinder Club director to a sk the<br>
conference to conduct the Investiture service. Where there is no club, the<br>
church-school teacher places the request. All who are to be invested must<br>
be able to present their Pathfinder Class card to be signed by the<br>
conference youth ministries director prior to the Investiture service.<br>
Records are kept both by the Pathfinder Club secretarvy and the<br>
conference o ffice of all who receive certificates, Honors, and pins.<br>

b. Benefits to the Individual (20 min.)<br>
In this section we emphasize the importance of camping and outdoor<br>
education in the Pathfinder program. It must be emphasized that we are<br>
only discussing basic aspects in this session-the real learning takes place<br>
in the outdoors.<br>
                           <br>
Outdoor living holds a tremendous potential in spiritual values and character-building elements. Campcraft offers great opportunity for practicing democratic group procedures; for building self-reliance, resourcefulness, self-discipline, and respect for other people; for practical application of nature lore and for its greatest appreciation; and best of all – Pathfinders like it. It is therefore recommended that, outdoor living with its multi-skilled requirements compose a large segment of the year's Pathfinder program.<br>
                           <br>
This is especially true when one considers that familiarity with the<br>
wilderness may be a great asset in the days to come. The experience that<br>
is gained through fellowship in camping and the skills developed in<br>
outdoor survival will be very helpful to God's people in the time of<br>
trouble.<br>
                           <br>
2. A perception of nature's blueprint for and interdependent upon of things.<br>
In this age of artificial amusements and synthetic excitement, we<br>
should turn to outdoor recreation. God counsels in Messages to Young<br>
People, pages 380, 381 &quot;There are modes of recreation which are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind. An enlightened,<br>
discrimina ting mind will find abundant means for entertainment and<br>
diversion, from sources not only innocent, but instructive. Recreation<br>
in the open air, the contemplation of the works of God in nature,<br>
will be of the highest benefit.&quot;<br>
Camping provides many opportunities for individual and group<br>
development. Let us discuss these under two headings: Benefits to<br>
the Individual and The Camper's Lifestyle.<br>
                           <br>
1. An intimate knowledge of nature with a love for all her facets which<br>
will never leave and will constantly bring back nostalgic memories<br>
and a longing to be outdoors again.<br>
a each other andg all things in balance<br>
one's place in the scheme<br>
                           <br>
3. A meaningful spiritual awakening that reveals God's presence and<br>
touch in everything as the camper views the majesty of a high<br>
mountain, the peace of a quiet valley, the glory of a colorful sunset,<br>
the glint of sun-light on the lake, or dewdrops glistening on an<br>
intricate spider web.<br>
                           <br>
4. An understanding of the true meaning of conserving natural<br>
resources and the reasons that immediate action is necessary if we<br>
are to save any of the little that remains after so many years of<br>
neglect and destruction by our affluent society, which has<br>
assumed that the supply of natural resources is inexhaustible.<br>
                           <br>
5. A new self-respect and self-confidence as one learns to manage for<br>
oneself and do things others may previously have done for him or her.<br>
Others are too busy with their own jobs to pamper or pick up after<br>
another campe.<br>
                           <br>
6. A pride in one's ability to improvise and make do with what is available.<br>
At camp the Pathfinder cannot run to the store to replace something<br>
damaged or satisfy the whim of the moment.<br>
                           <br>
7. A feeling of at-homeness in the out-of-doors as one learns to use<br>
natural materials, selecting and preparing those best suited to his or her<br>
needs with such simple tools as an axe, knife, or saw.<br>
                           <br>
8. A respect for the dignity of work and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
sweating and struggling to cook over a smoky fire, construct a lean-to<br>
shelter, or build a bridge across a stream.<br>
                           <br>
9. Pride in good health and physical fitness that vigorous outdoor life<br>
brings as it stimulates the camper's lungs and heart, exercises muscles,<br>
and produces an appetite for the simple, nutritious meals cooked out-<br>
doors or planned and served indoors.<br>
                           <br>
10. A new and more realistic sense of values as one notes how unimportant<br>
such things as money, material possessions, IQ, and fine clothes are in<br>
assessing the true worth of an individual. In camp one finds that the<br>
happiest, best liked, and most respected counselors and campers have<br>
spurned outward appearances and material possessions.<br>
                           <br>
11. A feeling of community, pride, and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
serving others, as one maintains the campsite for the benefit of present<br>
and future campers.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>c. Benefits of Camping Activities</em><br>
1. Developing lifetime hobbies and sometimes a vocation. Experience in a<br>
wide variety of activities discloses the canper's interests as well as<br>
aptitudes and broadens his or her perspectives, building unders tanding<br>
and appreciation for the interests of others. Camping aims to develop all-<br>
around abilities rather than specialization in a few, as is so often done in<br>
school sports and other activities in which only a few are chosen to<br>
participate while the majority remain on the sidelines to cheer.<br>
                           <br>
2. Encourages one to try to improve one's own performance. Although<br>
there is enough competition to give those with superior ability a<br>
chance to shine, most of the emphasis is on self-improvement. This<br>
is preferable to the situation in a highly competitive program where<br>
a few nearly always do well and may beconme smug and conceited,<br>
while others are usually well down the scale, become dejected, and<br>
have a &quot; don't care&quot; attitude.<br>
3. Having just plain fun as well as the excitement and new experiences<br>
every normal child craves but doing it in a wholly safe and sane way.<br>
Youngsters who can find the ir thrills this way will never &quot;need&quot; to<br>
resort to stealing, fighting, or killing just for &quot;kicks.&quot;<br>
4. Developing a wholeso me curiosity and desire to investigate and<br>
learn. The whole camp approach is &quot;Let's go and find out.&quot;<br>
5. Learning how to properly balance work, play, rest, and alternate<br>
periods of vigorous activity with those less active; observing regular<br>
hours for rest and sleep.<br>
6. Education on the wise use of leisure time, choo sing activities that<br>
recreate rather than kill time. This fulfills one of society's greatest<br>
needs as leisure time increases and working hours decrease. Many of<br>
the out-of-doors camp activities (canoeing, swimming, hiking,<br>
boating, fishing, camping out, nature study, horseback riding)<br>
provide the interests and skills necessary to take advantage of our<br>
rapidly expanding parks and other recreatio nal facilities. Although<br>
football and basketball may be fine school sports, few will continue<br>
in them after school days are over.<br>
7. Learning to enjoy simple pastimes that don't cost a lot of money as<br>
well as learning to entertain oneself instead of relying on others or<br>
on canned entertainment.<br>
8. Developing appreciation for serious and thoughtful programs by<br>
participating in vespers, observing Sabbath, and enjoying campfire<br>
programs based on thought-provoking themes and rituals.<br>
Spirit of Prophecy quotations:<br>
&quot;Those vwho sacrifice simplicity to fashion, and shut them-selves away<br>
from the beauties of nature, cannot be spiritually minded. They cannot<br>
understand the skill and power of God as revealed in His created works;<br>
therefore their hearts do not quicken and throb with new love and<br>
interest, and they are not filled with awe and reverence as they see God<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
in nature&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 584).<br>
&quot;As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction<br>
into the mind. It is not the conviction that logical reasonings produces;<br>
but unless the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye too dim<br>
to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning is<br>
grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the written word are<br>
impressed on the heart&quot; (Christ's Objet Lessons, p. 24).<br>
&quot;Christ sharply reproved the men of His time because they had not<br>
learned from nature the spiritual lessons which they might have learned.<br>
All things, animate and inanimate, express to man the knowledge of<br>
God&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 580).<br>
&quot;The more quiet and simple the life of the child, – the more free<br>
from artificial excitement and the more in harmony with nature,<br>
the more favorable it is to physical and mental vigor and to spiritual<br>
strength&quot; (Education, p. 107).<br>
&quot;So far as possible, let the child from his earliest years be placed where<br>
this wonderful lesson-book [the book of nature] shall be open be fore<br>
him.... In no other way can the foundation of a true education be so<br>
firmly and surely laid&quot; (Education, p. 100-101).<br>
&quot;From His earliest years He [Jesus] was possessed of one purpose; He<br>
lived to bless others. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas<br>
of ways and means flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and<br>
animal life.<br>
He was trying to understand the reason of things. Heavenly<br>
beings were His attendants, and the culture of holy thoughts and<br>
communings was His. From the first dawning of intelligence He was<br>
constantly growing in spiritual grace and knowledge of truth.<br>
&quot;... Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did&quot; (Desire of Ages, p. 70).<br>
d. Spiritual Values in Camping<br>
Never in the history of the world has so much depended on the spiritual<br>
orientation of youth. And no group of peoplepreachers, teachers, or<br>
parents - has a greater opportunity to direct that orientation than the<br>
people who live with children and adolescents through camping<br>
experiences of the summer months. Lives have been changed in summer<br>
camps. No one goes through a camping experience without its leaving<br>
some mark upon his or her spirit. Whe ther you know it, whether you<br>
desire it, you are going to affect, for good or ill, the spiritual lives of the<br>
young people le vith whom you deal.<br>
In speaking of spiritual values in camping we are not<br>
teachings of any religious group – their doctrine or any form of<br>
worship-but rather with that which will lead us to an experience of<br>
orienting our souls toward God and to ward our fellow men.<br>
Test the spiritual values of your camp life.<br>
1, Closeness to nature<br>
dealing with the<br>
2. The Experience of harmony and order<br>
In camp you build your own shelter of na tive materials, and cook<br>
your own food over an open fire. As you do these things, you are<br>
close to nature and you come to know her as a friend. You climb<br>
hills, discover the treasures of the forest or meadow, make friends<br>
with trees, birds, animals, and even insects. Having this experience<br>
will call out a sense of wonder-the purest approach to the reality of<br>
God.<br>
135<br>
The tragedy of today's living is that we have lived so long in the<br>
presence of the distorted and the abnormal that we actually mistake<br>
abnormality for normality and distortion for real. Think of the world to<br>
which these campers of ours belonga world of blaring radios,<br>
television, gangster comics, torrid movies, wild music, and art without<br>
meaning. Then think of the world to which we are privileged to<br>
introduce them a world of balanced harmony in light and shade,<br>
color variety, trees, and mountains. And all have beauty just in being<br>
themselves.<br>
3. God's great creativeness<br>
If we are to cure the sickness of a maddened world, we must return to<br>
nature for the greatest lessons that God would have us learn. In our<br>
camping experience we come into the presence of God's design.<br>
As we finger clay, dabble with paint, or learn to weave, we do not set<br>
out just to imitate nature. There is within the human spirit that urge that<br>
makes us akin to God– the urge to create out of the deepest<br>
yearnings of our spirit.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
4. Adaptability<br>
Nature is inexorable. Rain falls in spite of our fond desires. But<br>
when we learn to live with nature, to adapt ourselves to her moods,<br>
we find that in every aspect she is beautiful. To a real camper the<br>
circumstances of life become a challenge, and in nature's every<br>
aspect appears the hand of God.<br>
5. Cooperative fellowship<br>
It is here that the camper will discover community. We are members of<br>
one another, and our world is going to disintegrate completely unless<br>
we recognize it. There is also discovered a democracy, the sharing of<br>
responsibility. Democracy also means a leveling process in which at<br>
times the camper may even be able to teach the counselor, and all<br>
artificial distinctions drop away.<br>
CASE STUDIES<br>
How would you solve these problems?<br>
Below are four situations typical of those that could develop in your camp<br>
or during other type of outdoor activities. After studying the case<br>
description, decide which of the statements following it would be the best<br>
solution, and place a check mark before it.<br>
Case One<br>
A counselor and his Path finders make plans for a short hike and<br>
cookout. They plan the menu and divide the responsibilities. At the<br>
campsite, Jerry and Ben go to get firewood while the other boys cook<br>
the meal and tend to their duties. In the space of a few minutes there is<br>
a scream and Ben yells for help. The counselor hurriedly makes his way<br>
to Ben and finds that Jerry has badly cut his leg with the axe. He<br>
administers first aid, and the unit makes its way home with the<br>
wounded boy, their fun spoiled by an accident. What would have been<br>
the best method of preventing this misfortune?<br>
Case Two<br>
The boys should not have been permitted to use the axe.<br>
2. The counselor should have accompanied the boys who<br>
were getting the wood.<br>
3. A project that would have been safer should have been<br>
planned.<br>
4. The boys should have been given better training in the<br>
use of the axe.<br>
The Pathfinder unit decides to go horseback riding with thir<br>
counselor, Anne. All of them have ridden horses before. Anne asks<br>
each of them to walk the horse whenever footing is unsure. All goes<br>
well until they start back to the stables. A short distance from the<br>
stables, on a rocky, downhill trail, Susie, who is riding at the head of<br>
the group, lets her horse break into a trot. The other Path finders follow<br>
Susie's example, but Anne who is the last rider, holds her horse to a<br>
walk and brings up the rear. When Anne arrives at the stables, she<br>
reprimands Susie and tells her she cannot ride with the group again. What<br>
would you have done?<br>
1. Ignored the incident, since no one was injured.<br>
136<br>
2. Ridden at the head of the group.<br>
3. Made the same decision that Anne made.<br>
4. Reprimanded all the Pathfinders and deprived<br>
them of future riding.<br>
Discussed the situation, explaining the reason for the<br>
safety precaution and warn that the infraction should not<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Case Three<br>
Occur again.<br>
A Pathfinder Club is having an overnight camp out by the lake. When the<br>
campfire is over, a movement starts among the group to go for a<br>
moonlight swim.<br>
What should the counselor do?<br>
1. Tell them moonlight swimming is against the rules.<br>
Lecture the group on the dangers, then let them decide.<br>
3. Tell them you wish it were possible, but the hazards<br>
outweigh the pleasure.<br>
4. Say nothing, allow the group to swim, and do your best to<br>
ensure safety.<br>
Case Four<br>
Comments on case: In case three, a situation is presented in which on the<br>
impulse of the moment, Pathfinders suggest an activity having some<br>
grave safety problems. It should be assumed here that the leadership<br>
has decided that the dangers outweigh the advantages. It is a question<br>
of the Club director and staff bcing able to pres<br>
esent convincing and<br>
sound reasons for refusing the request. It would also be wise to<br>
substitute some other safe activity in place of the moonlight swim. It is<br>
a case in which the staff should carefully canvas the possibilities and<br>
anticipate such a tum of events, getting the group to agree to a program that<br>
John is the counselor of a unit that has asked for an overnight hike, which will<br>
mean the preparation of two meals out-of-doors. Although most of the<br>
members have been on similar trips before, John does not feel that he is<br>
qualified to lead his group on the proposed trip.<br>
What should he do?<br>
1. Aska more experienced counselor in campcraft to accompany him<br>
and his group?<br>
2. Persuade his unit to take a less extensive trip that he is more<br>
capable of leading?<br>
3. Refuse to consider the trip?<br>
_4. Go with the group and learn as he goes?<br>
Comments on Case: Counselors need to have had experience in outdoor skills<br>
before leading a unit. In this case, John is unfortunate to have been caught in a<br>
situation in which he feels unquali fied to lead his group on a proposed trip. A<br>
counselor's influence with his group is enhanced when he demonstrates skills<br>
that are applauded by the group. It would be well for him to go out into his<br>
138<br>
own backyard and cook a meal or two, and then go with the group and learn<br>
as he goes.<br>
did not include a oonlight swim.<br>

As leaders, you may think the above suggestions are too organized, but<br>
remember that young people like to be active; if they are not active they<br>
will get into mischief. Also remember that Satan finds something for idle<br>
hands to do.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Guidelines for a Good Campout<br>
1. General rules for running the campout<br>
a, Insist on absolute consideration for the other person, As a result there<br>
will be no practical jokes, the person and property of each will be out<br>
of bounds for all others; all camp chores will be shared; the nights will<br>
be quiet; sanitation and personal cleanliness are a must. Tents are not<br>
disturbed.<br>
b. Everyone will take part in all the activities, including discussions,<br>
worship, instruction, and practical learning. Teaming up is half the fun.<br>
C. Be sure that all campers and staff recognize that God is camped with<br>
us. This will show in our words and attitudes. Any Sabbath kept during<br>
the campout will show our loyalty to God. We will all join in thoughtful<br>
worship, morning and evening. The natural surro undings will be cared<br>
for as His contribution to our pleasure.<br>
2. What to bring<br>
a. Hiking clothes, including boots and rain gear, suitable to enjoy<br>
water, mud, sun, rain, without worry of ruining them<br>
b. Change of clothing for night wear or emergency; including an extra<br>
warm sweater<br>
c. Food as listed, eating and cooking gear, cleaning up needs<br>
d. Sleeping bag, ground cover, compass, flashlight (able to throwa<br>
good beam for several hours)<br>
e. Bible, pamphlet, notebook, ball point pen, personal First-aid kit<br>
f. Personal cleanliness needs, including toilet paper<br>
g. Humor, patience, helpfulness, determination to make it a good<br>
trip for all<br>
3. Cooking arrangements<br>
a. Most easily done on a portable stove that may be used in a tent or<br>
under wet conditions.<br>
b. Cook in pairs, sharing some utensils but campers should pack own<br>
food supplies<br>
4. On the go<br>
a. Time your hiking to arrive at suitable campsites (water, shelter, level<br>
ground) by Haismi th's Rule.<br>
Easy going<br>
Easy scrambling<br>
Rough country, deep sand,<br>
soft snow, thick bush<br>
4.8 km/hr (3 mph/hr)<br>
3 km/hr (2 mph/hr)<br>
141<br>
1.6 km/hr (1 mph/hr)<br>
For every hour over five hours allow one hour for fatigue. For<br>
very fit and experienced walkers reduce time by one-third.<br>
b. Train yourself mentally and physically to enjoy all types of weather and<br>
terrain. Practice coping safely with night walking, river crossing,<br>
exposure conditions, vertical dimbs, and sleeping on the ground. Learn<br>
all you can from experienced hikers.<br>
C. Keep a clear personal log, making your own map and compass<br>
readings to be responsible for your own safety. Do your own<br>
mapping where neces sary. If conditions limit accuracy, state<br>
approximately how accurate your information is.<br>
d. Fill in log books in huts you pass to facilitate any Search and<br>
Rescue operation, should such be necessary.<br>
e. Notice the thrill of overcoming the unreasonable dislike of<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
f. Get used to the weight of boots, the feel of wool next to the skin,<br>
the full pack on your back, and the sense of responsibility that<br>
goes with such freedom.<br>
g. Develop the attitude that you are an invited visitor into God's world.<br>
He made it for you. Enjoy it!<br>
5. When you come back<br>
discomfort, wet clothes, muddy skins, darkness, solitude. You're<br>
tougher than you think.<br>
a. Sort out your pack into:<br>
C.<br>
b. Next time look after the ounces (grams) and the pounds<br>
(kilos) will look after themselves.<br>
(1) What you actually used<br>
FOOD<br>
(2) What you could use from your observations<br>
(3) What you now know you'll never use (discard it)<br>
d. The benefits of such an experience will be felt long after the scars<br>
have healed!<br>
Be thankful.<br>

Country Code<br>
When on a hike, participants should observe the following<br>
&quot;Country Code.&quot;<br>
1. Contact the local police station if undertaking an expedition in<br>
unpopulated areas or for a lengthy period of time.<br>
2. Guard against all risks of fire. Check on fire bans with local<br>
police.<br>
3. Leave gates the same way you found them.<br>
4. Keep dogs and/or horses under proper control.<br>
5. Leave no litter. What goes out full can return empty.<br>
6. Avoid damaging fences, gates, etc.<br>
7. Ask permission to use private property BEFORE the<br>
expedition.<br>
8. Check and safeguard water supplies.<br>
9. Travel carefully on country roads.<br>
10. Protect wildlife, plants, and trees.<br>
11. Respect life of the countryside.<br>
NOTE: Permission must be obtained from the owner BEFORE<br>
the expedition to camp on private property.<br>

                           <br>
3. Types of Camping<br>
Let's look now at two basic types of camping.<br>
a. Site camps<br>
b. Trave ling camps<br>
It is said, &quot;Variety is the spice of life.&quot; While this is not always true, it is<br>
fairly true of camping. To do the same thing over and over becomes<br>
monotonous and boring. Path finders, while they enjoy camping and will<br>
stick with the program, like adventure, challenge, and development of new<br>
skills. This is especially applicable to the older age group. The harder the<br>
challenge the more enjoyment they seem to get, especially when the<br>
challenge can be accomplished. It is damaging to set before a young person<br>
a goal that you know cannot be achieved. Always set realistic goals.<br>
&quot;Static&quot;<br>
The goals you set are determined by the type of camp you have. If you plan<br>
to teach your group abseiling or rappeling, then don't wear them out by<br>
having hiking, biking, canoeing, or other types of physically exhausting<br>
camps. Plan to concentrate your efforts in both theory and practice on<br>
achieving the goal. A site camp would be preferable for this goal, with<br>
transport readily available in an emergency. Try to achieve ONE major goal<br>
in a campout with subsidiary goals that point to the major goal.<br>
Remember that your site must be che cked out beforehand so that the goal<br>
you hope to achieve will be realized. Goals determine the site.<br>
Don't always find a nice site then work your campouts around that site.<br>
Good sites are hard to come by and it is easy to plan a camp once you have<br>
a site, but invariably you will find that the type of camp you offer will<br>
become stereotyped. This is all right for a new Club or for new Pathfinders,<br>
but it is not satisfactory for older members or for you as a leader to<br>
continue to do this. Both your older Pathfinders and your own initiative will<br>
soon be in a rut and the excitement of new horizons will become lost. Have<br>
you ever wondered, &quot;Why do kids enjoy camping so much when it seems<br>
such a lot of hard work and inconvenience?&quot; It just might be that you are<br>
already experiencing this syndrome. Plan to do something exciting,<br>
something different, and your enthusiasm will challenge the older Path-<br>
finders.<br>
a. Site Camp<br>
Let us list some of the types of camps that you could organize.<br>
It is good to have at least one each year. A site camp is simply a camp to<br>
which you drive your vehicles, erect your tents, camp at the samne place,<br>
then drive home at the conclusion of the camp. All activities focus<br>
around the site.<br>
These campouts are really good in that they help you to achieve a<br>
whole variety of things such as:<br>
Pathfinder classwork<br>
Swimming Honors<br>
Rock Climbing<br>
Hiking<br>
Fire building<br>
...20 (min.)<br>
Nature Honors<br>
(trees, ferns, flowers, etc.)<br>
Signaling<br>
Camperaft Honors<br>
Bible camps<br>
Axemanship<br>
Track and trail<br>
Lashings/knots<br>
Fire Building<br>
Orienteering<br>
146<br>
Make sure that there is a purpose to each campout you have, and that<br>
people are there with sufficient knowledge in particular areas to help<br>
you realize that purpose. Don't make your goal &quot;to have a good time.&quot;<br>
This must be a by-product of your camp, rather than an end in itself.<br>
Meeting new challenges, seeing new horizons, and developing new skills<br>
(which is cducation) providcs advcnturc that will cnsurc that cverybody<br>
has a good time. The balance betwveen what is done in 1) the theoretical<br>
way, and 2) a practical way, will largely determine the &quot;great time&quot; that<br>
was had.<br>
Don't overburden with theory, but make sure that sufficient has been<br>
learned to avoid pitfalls. They say &quot;a fool learns by his own mistakes<br>
but a wise man learns from the mistakes of fools.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
b. Traveling Camps<br>
These camps move from one location to another and are designed to<br>
bring out initiative, reso urcefulness, courage, strength, and ability while<br>
putting into practice the things a Pathfinder has learned. Site camps can<br>
do this, too, but there is a challenge and a sense of achievement and<br>
adventure that can be gained on a traveling campout that cannot be<br>
achieved on a site campout. A Pathfinder has to learn to depend on his<br>
or her physical well being, knowledge and equipment to a far greater<br>
capacity, and in all these things sees the hand of God more clearly<br>
revealed. When you are halfway between point A and B, and are<br>
exhausted and feel that one more step will be your last, it is then that :<br>
person realizes his or her extremity and reaches out for help. At the<br>
conclusion of the campout that person has achieved the seemingly<br>
impossible but is determined to be more physically fit, have better<br>
equipment, and know more of what is to be done the next time.<br>
It is important to encourage the ones who drift to the rear and slow<br>
those who race to the front. The first hour or two will usually indicate<br>
what the general pattern will be, and it is important to check it before it<br>
gets out of control. It is wise to make an announcement that &quot;someone<br>
(who knows the way) will lead and &quot;'someone will bring up the rear. All<br>
Pathfinders must then be contained between these two leaders. This<br>
must be strictly enforced for the first day or two, depending on how long<br>
the group is going to travel. Nothing is more psychologically devastating<br>
to a traveling camper than to be always at the end of the line, and who<br>
knows what trouble they could be in if left to struggle while everyone<br>
else tears ahead. Sometimes these campers need to be put to the front.<br>
It is amazing how much faster they travel when they take the lead. It is<br>
not wise to scold, for that will cause even more disco uragement. It is<br>
better to play psychological games with everyone, thus encouraging all<br>
to be more helpful.<br>
The person who consistently barges ahead in the lead must be held back. He<br>
or she can get into all sorts of difficulty, and may be involved in an<br>
accident or get lost by such foolhardiness. That person also needs<br>
encouragement in being helpful to the group. Maybe he or she could carry a<br>
bit of extra weight from the slower ones or help the slower ones by walking<br>
with them and thus encouraging them or ministering to their needs.<br>
Whatever happens, it is essential that the group be contained and move<br>
forward as a group.<br>
It is important that all equipment taken on a travel campout be of good<br>
quality. Repairs along the way often make the poor quality article worse.<br>
Sometimes something can be rendered irreparable on the first day and<br>
you are then stuck without<br>

b. Benefits to the Individual (20 min.)<br>
In this section we emphasize the importance of camping and outdoor<br>
education in the Pathfinder program. It must be emphasized that we are<br>
only discussing basic aspects in this session-the real learning takes place<br>
in the outdoors.<br>
                           <br>
Outdoor living holds a tremendous potential in spiritual values and character-building elements. Campcraft offers great opportunity for practicing democratic group procedures; for building self-reliance, resourcefulness, self-discipline, and respect for other people; for practical application of nature lore and for its greatest appreciation; and best of all – Pathfinders like it. It is therefore recommended that, outdoor living with its multi-skilled requirements compose a large segment of the year's Pathfinder program.<br>
                           <br>
This is especially true when one considers that familiarity with the<br>
wilderness may be a great asset in the days to come. The experience that<br>
is gained through fellowship in camping and the skills developed in<br>
outdoor survival will be very helpful to God's people in the time of<br>
trouble.<br>
                           <br>
2. A perception of nature's blueprint for and interdependent upon of things.<br>
In this age of artificial amusements and synthetic excitement, we<br>
should turn to outdoor recreation. God counsels in Messages to Young<br>
People, pages 380, 381 &quot;There are modes of recreation which are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind. An enlightened,<br>
discrimina ting mind will find abundant means for entertainment and<br>
diversion, from sources not only innocent, but instructive. Recreation<br>
in the open air, the contemplation of the works of God in nature,<br>
will be of the highest benefit.&quot;<br>
Camping provides many opportunities for individual and group<br>
development. Let us discuss these under two headings: Benefits to<br>
the Individual and The Camper's Lifestyle.<br>
                           <br>
1. An intimate knowledge of nature with a love for all her facets which<br>
will never leave and will constantly bring back nostalgic memories<br>
and a longing to be outdoors again.<br>
a each other andg all things in balance<br>
one's place in the scheme<br>
                           <br>
3. A meaningful spiritual awakening that reveals God's presence and<br>
touch in everything as the camper views the majesty of a high<br>
mountain, the peace of a quiet valley, the glory of a colorful sunset,<br>
the glint of sun-light on the lake, or dewdrops glistening on an<br>
intricate spider web.<br>
                           <br>
4. An understanding of the true meaning of conserving natural<br>
resources and the reasons that immediate action is necessary if we<br>
are to save any of the little that remains after so many years of<br>
neglect and destruction by our affluent society, which has<br>
assumed that the supply of natural resources is inexhaustible.<br>
                           <br>
5. A new self-respect and self-confidence as one learns to manage for<br>
oneself and do things others may previously have done for him or her.<br>
Others are too busy with their own jobs to pamper or pick up after<br>
another campe.<br>
                           <br>
6. A pride in one's ability to improvise and make do with what is available.<br>
At camp the Pathfinder cannot run to the store to replace something<br>
damaged or satisfy the whim of the moment.<br>
                           <br>
7. A feeling of at-homeness in the out-of-doors as one learns to use<br>
natural materials, selecting and preparing those best suited to his or her<br>
needs with such simple tools as an axe, knife, or saw.<br>
                           <br>
8. A respect for the dignity of work and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
sweating and struggling to cook over a smoky fire, construct a lean-to<br>
shelter, or build a bridge across a stream.<br>
                           <br>
9. Pride in good health and physical fitness that vigorous outdoor life<br>
brings as it stimulates the camper's lungs and heart, exercises muscles,<br>
and produces an appetite for the simple, nutritious meals cooked out-<br>
doors or planned and served indoors.<br>
                           <br>
10. A new and more realistic sense of values as one notes how unimportant<br>
such things as money, material possessions, IQ, and fine clothes are in<br>
assessing the true worth of an individual. In camp one finds that the<br>
happiest, best liked, and most respected counselors and campers have<br>
spurned outward appearances and material possessions.<br>
                           <br>
11. A feeling of community, pride, and the satisfaction that comes from<br>
serving others, as one maintains the campsite for the benefit of present<br>
and future campers.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>c. Benefits of Camping Activities</em><br>
1. Developing lifetime hobbies and sometimes a vocation. Experience in a<br>
wide variety of activities discloses the canper's interests as well as<br>
aptitudes and broadens his or her perspectives, building unders tanding<br>
and appreciation for the interests of others. Camping aims to develop all-<br>
around abilities rather than specialization in a few, as is so often done in<br>
school sports and other activities in which only a few are chosen to<br>
participate while the majority remain on the sidelines to cheer.<br>
                           <br>
2. Encourages one to try to improve one's own performance. Although<br>
there is enough competition to give those with superior ability a<br>
chance to shine, most of the emphasis is on self-improvement. This<br>
is preferable to the situation in a highly competitive program where<br>
a few nearly always do well and may beconme smug and conceited,<br>
while others are usually well down the scale, become dejected, and<br>
have a &quot; don't care&quot; attitude.<br>
3. Having just plain fun as well as the excitement and new experiences<br>
every normal child craves but doing it in a wholly safe and sane way.<br>
Youngsters who can find the ir thrills this way will never &quot;need&quot; to<br>
resort to stealing, fighting, or killing just for &quot;kicks.&quot;<br>
4. Developing a wholeso me curiosity and desire to investigate and<br>
learn. The whole camp approach is &quot;Let's go and find out.&quot;<br>
5. Learning how to properly balance work, play, rest, and alternate<br>
periods of vigorous activity with those less active; observing regular<br>
hours for rest and sleep.<br>
6. Education on the wise use of leisure time, choo sing activities that<br>
recreate rather than kill time. This fulfills one of society's greatest<br>
needs as leisure time increases and working hours decrease. Many of<br>
the out-of-doors camp activities (canoeing, swimming, hiking,<br>
boating, fishing, camping out, nature study, horseback riding)<br>
provide the interests and skills necessary to take advantage of our<br>
rapidly expanding parks and other recreatio nal facilities. Although<br>
football and basketball may be fine school sports, few will continue<br>
in them after school days are over.<br>
7. Learning to enjoy simple pastimes that don't cost a lot of money as<br>
well as learning to entertain oneself instead of relying on others or<br>
on canned entertainment.<br>
8. Developing appreciation for serious and thoughtful programs by<br>
participating in vespers, observing Sabbath, and enjoying campfire<br>
programs based on thought-provoking themes and rituals.<br>
Spirit of Prophecy quotations:<br>
&quot;Those vwho sacrifice simplicity to fashion, and shut them-selves away<br>
from the beauties of nature, cannot be spiritually minded. They cannot<br>
understand the skill and power of God as revealed in His created works;<br>
therefore their hearts do not quicken and throb with new love and<br>
interest, and they are not filled with awe and reverence as they see God<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
in nature&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 584).<br>
&quot;As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction<br>
into the mind. It is not the conviction that logical reasonings produces;<br>
but unless the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye too dim<br>
to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning is<br>
grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the written word are<br>
impressed on the heart&quot; (Christ's Objet Lessons, p. 24).<br>
&quot;Christ sharply reproved the men of His time because they had not<br>
learned from nature the spiritual lessons which they might have learned.<br>
All things, animate and inanimate, express to man the knowledge of<br>
God&quot; (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 580).<br>
&quot;The more quiet and simple the life of the child, – the more free<br>
from artificial excitement and the more in harmony with nature,<br>
the more favorable it is to physical and mental vigor and to spiritual<br>
strength&quot; (Education, p. 107).<br>
&quot;So far as possible, let the child from his earliest years be placed where<br>
this wonderful lesson-book [the book of nature] shall be open be fore<br>
him.... In no other way can the foundation of a true education be so<br>
firmly and surely laid&quot; (Education, p. 100-101).<br>
&quot;From His earliest years He [Jesus] was possessed of one purpose; He<br>
lived to bless others. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas<br>
of ways and means flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and<br>
animal life.<br>
He was trying to understand the reason of things. Heavenly<br>
beings were His attendants, and the culture of holy thoughts and<br>
communings was His. From the first dawning of intelligence He was<br>
constantly growing in spiritual grace and knowledge of truth.<br>
&quot;... Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did&quot; (Desire of Ages, p. 70).<br>
d. Spiritual Values in Camping<br>
Never in the history of the world has so much depended on the spiritual<br>
orientation of youth. And no group of peoplepreachers, teachers, or<br>
parents - has a greater opportunity to direct that orientation than the<br>
people who live with children and adolescents through camping<br>
experiences of the summer months. Lives have been changed in summer<br>
camps. No one goes through a camping experience without its leaving<br>
some mark upon his or her spirit. Whe ther you know it, whether you<br>
desire it, you are going to affect, for good or ill, the spiritual lives of the<br>
young people le vith whom you deal.<br>
In speaking of spiritual values in camping we are not<br>
teachings of any religious group – their doctrine or any form of<br>
worship-but rather with that which will lead us to an experience of<br>
orienting our souls toward God and to ward our fellow men.<br>
Test the spiritual values of your camp life.<br>
1, Closeness to nature<br>
dealing with the<br>
2. The Experience of harmony and order<br>
In camp you build your own shelter of na tive materials, and cook<br>
your own food over an open fire. As you do these things, you are<br>
close to nature and you come to know her as a friend. You climb<br>
hills, discover the treasures of the forest or meadow, make friends<br>
with trees, birds, animals, and even insects. Having this experience<br>
will call out a sense of wonder-the purest approach to the reality of<br>
God.<br>
135<br>
The tragedy of today's living is that we have lived so long in the<br>
presence of the distorted and the abnormal that we actually mistake<br>
abnormality for normality and distortion for real. Think of the world to<br>
which these campers of ours belonga world of blaring radios,<br>
television, gangster comics, torrid movies, wild music, and art without<br>
meaning. Then think of the world to which we are privileged to<br>
introduce them a world of balanced harmony in light and shade,<br>
color variety, trees, and mountains. And all have beauty just in being<br>
themselves.<br>
3. God's great creativeness<br>
If we are to cure the sickness of a maddened world, we must return to<br>
nature for the greatest lessons that God would have us learn. In our<br>
camping experience we come into the presence of God's design.<br>
As we finger clay, dabble with paint, or learn to weave, we do not set<br>
out just to imitate nature. There is within the human spirit that urge that<br>
makes us akin to God– the urge to create out of the deepest<br>
yearnings of our spirit.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
4. Adaptability<br>
Nature is inexorable. Rain falls in spite of our fond desires. But<br>
when we learn to live with nature, to adapt ourselves to her moods,<br>
we find that in every aspect she is beautiful. To a real camper the<br>
circumstances of life become a challenge, and in nature's every<br>
aspect appears the hand of God.<br>
5. Cooperative fellowship<br>
It is here that the camper will discover community. We are members of<br>
one another, and our world is going to disintegrate completely unless<br>
we recognize it. There is also discovered a democracy, the sharing of<br>
responsibility. Democracy also means a leveling process in which at<br>
times the camper may even be able to teach the counselor, and all<br>
artificial distinctions drop away.<br>
CASE STUDIES<br>
How would you solve these problems?<br>
Below are four situations typical of those that could develop in your camp<br>
or during other type of outdoor activities. After studying the case<br>
description, decide which of the statements following it would be the best<br>
solution, and place a check mark before it.<br>
Case One<br>
A counselor and his Path finders make plans for a short hike and<br>
cookout. They plan the menu and divide the responsibilities. At the<br>
campsite, Jerry and Ben go to get firewood while the other boys cook<br>
the meal and tend to their duties. In the space of a few minutes there is<br>
a scream and Ben yells for help. The counselor hurriedly makes his way<br>
to Ben and finds that Jerry has badly cut his leg with the axe. He<br>
administers first aid, and the unit makes its way home with the<br>
wounded boy, their fun spoiled by an accident. What would have been<br>
the best method of preventing this misfortune?<br>
Case Two<br>
The boys should not have been permitted to use the axe.<br>
2. The counselor should have accompanied the boys who<br>
were getting the wood.<br>
3. A project that would have been safer should have been<br>
planned.<br>
4. The boys should have been given better training in the<br>
use of the axe.<br>
The Pathfinder unit decides to go horseback riding with thir<br>
counselor, Anne. All of them have ridden horses before. Anne asks<br>
each of them to walk the horse whenever footing is unsure. All goes<br>
well until they start back to the stables. A short distance from the<br>
stables, on a rocky, downhill trail, Susie, who is riding at the head of<br>
the group, lets her horse break into a trot. The other Path finders follow<br>
Susie's example, but Anne who is the last rider, holds her horse to a<br>
walk and brings up the rear. When Anne arrives at the stables, she<br>
reprimands Susie and tells her she cannot ride with the group again. What<br>
would you have done?<br>
1. Ignored the incident, since no one was injured.<br>
136<br>
2. Ridden at the head of the group.<br>
3. Made the same decision that Anne made.<br>
4. Reprimanded all the Pathfinders and deprived<br>
them of future riding.<br>
Discussed the situation, explaining the reason for the<br>
safety precaution and warn that the infraction should not<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Case Three<br>
Occur again.<br>
A Pathfinder Club is having an overnight camp out by the lake. When the<br>
campfire is over, a movement starts among the group to go for a<br>
moonlight swim.<br>
What should the counselor do?<br>
1. Tell them moonlight swimming is against the rules.<br>
Lecture the group on the dangers, then let them decide.<br>
3. Tell them you wish it were possible, but the hazards<br>
outweigh the pleasure.<br>
4. Say nothing, allow the group to swim, and do your best to<br>
ensure safety.<br>
Case Four<br>
Comments on case: In case three, a situation is presented in which on the<br>
impulse of the moment, Pathfinders suggest an activity having some<br>
grave safety problems. It should be assumed here that the leadership<br>
has decided that the dangers outweigh the advantages. It is a question<br>
of the Club director and staff bcing able to pres<br>
esent convincing and<br>
sound reasons for refusing the request. It would also be wise to<br>
substitute some other safe activity in place of the moonlight swim. It is<br>
a case in which the staff should carefully canvas the possibilities and<br>
anticipate such a tum of events, getting the group to agree to a program that<br>
John is the counselor of a unit that has asked for an overnight hike, which will<br>
mean the preparation of two meals out-of-doors. Although most of the<br>
members have been on similar trips before, John does not feel that he is<br>
qualified to lead his group on the proposed trip.<br>
What should he do?<br>
1. Aska more experienced counselor in campcraft to accompany him<br>
and his group?<br>
2. Persuade his unit to take a less extensive trip that he is more<br>
capable of leading?<br>
3. Refuse to consider the trip?<br>
_4. Go with the group and learn as he goes?<br>
Comments on Case: Counselors need to have had experience in outdoor skills<br>
before leading a unit. In this case, John is unfortunate to have been caught in a<br>
situation in which he feels unquali fied to lead his group on a proposed trip. A<br>
counselor's influence with his group is enhanced when he demonstrates skills<br>
that are applauded by the group. It would be well for him to go out into his<br>
138<br>
own backyard and cook a meal or two, and then go with the group and learn<br>
as he goes.<br>
did not include a oonlight swim.<br>

Planning a Camp<br>
In Pathfinder Clubs, camping and outdoor activities are a necessity and are<br>
highly beneficial to both body and mind.<br>
It is our aim to give you a sample of what is required of each leader in<br>
planning a campout. These suggestions will prove beneficial to all who<br>
plan and those who participate, making your camp not only successful<br>

As leaders, you may think the above suggestions are too organized, but<br>
remember that young people like to be active; if they are not active they<br>
will get into mischief. Also remember that Satan finds something for idle<br>
hands to do.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
Guidelines for a Good Campout<br>
1. General rules for running the campout<br>
a, Insist on absolute consideration for the other person, As a result there<br>
will be no practical jokes, the person and property of each will be out<br>
of bounds for all others; all camp chores will be shared; the nights will<br>
be quiet; sanitation and personal cleanliness are a must. Tents are not<br>
disturbed.<br>
b. Everyone will take part in all the activities, including discussions,<br>
worship, instruction, and practical learning. Teaming up is half the fun.<br>
C. Be sure that all campers and staff recognize that God is camped with<br>
us. This will show in our words and attitudes. Any Sabbath kept during<br>
the campout will show our loyalty to God. We will all join in thoughtful<br>
worship, morning and evening. The natural surro undings will be cared<br>
for as His contribution to our pleasure.<br>
2. What to bring<br>
a. Hiking clothes, including boots and rain gear, suitable to enjoy<br>
water, mud, sun, rain, without worry of ruining them<br>
b. Change of clothing for night wear or emergency; including an extra<br>
warm sweater<br>
c. Food as listed, eating and cooking gear, cleaning up needs<br>
d. Sleeping bag, ground cover, compass, flashlight (able to throwa<br>
good beam for several hours)<br>
e. Bible, pamphlet, notebook, ball point pen, personal First-aid kit<br>
f. Personal cleanliness needs, including toilet paper<br>
g. Humor, patience, helpfulness, determination to make it a good<br>
trip for all<br>
3. Cooking arrangements<br>
a. Most easily done on a portable stove that may be used in a tent or<br>
under wet conditions.<br>
b. Cook in pairs, sharing some utensils but campers should pack own<br>
food supplies<br>
4. On the go<br>
a. Time your hiking to arrive at suitable campsites (water, shelter, level<br>
ground) by Haismi th's Rule.<br>
Easy going<br>
Easy scrambling<br>
Rough country, deep sand,<br>
soft snow, thick bush<br>
4.8 km/hr (3 mph/hr)<br>
3 km/hr (2 mph/hr)<br>
141<br>
1.6 km/hr (1 mph/hr)<br>
For every hour over five hours allow one hour for fatigue. For<br>
very fit and experienced walkers reduce time by one-third.<br>
b. Train yourself mentally and physically to enjoy all types of weather and<br>
terrain. Practice coping safely with night walking, river crossing,<br>
exposure conditions, vertical dimbs, and sleeping on the ground. Learn<br>
all you can from experienced hikers.<br>
C. Keep a clear personal log, making your own map and compass<br>
readings to be responsible for your own safety. Do your own<br>
mapping where neces sary. If conditions limit accuracy, state<br>
approximately how accurate your information is.<br>
d. Fill in log books in huts you pass to facilitate any Search and<br>
Rescue operation, should such be necessary.<br>
e. Notice the thrill of overcoming the unreasonable dislike of<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
f. Get used to the weight of boots, the feel of wool next to the skin,<br>
the full pack on your back, and the sense of responsibility that<br>
goes with such freedom.<br>
g. Develop the attitude that you are an invited visitor into God's world.<br>
He made it for you. Enjoy it!<br>
5. When you come back<br>
discomfort, wet clothes, muddy skins, darkness, solitude. You're<br>
tougher than you think.<br>
a. Sort out your pack into:<br>
C.<br>
b. Next time look after the ounces (grams) and the pounds<br>
(kilos) will look after themselves.<br>
(1) What you actually used<br>
FOOD<br>
(2) What you could use from your observations<br>
(3) What you now know you'll never use (discard it)<br>
d. The benefits of such an experience will be felt long after the scars<br>
have healed!<br>
Be thankful.<br>

Country Code<br>
When on a hike, participants should observe the following<br>
&quot;Country Code.&quot;<br>
1. Contact the local police station if undertaking an expedition in<br>
unpopulated areas or for a lengthy period of time.<br>
2. Guard against all risks of fire. Check on fire bans with local<br>
police.<br>
3. Leave gates the same way you found them.<br>
4. Keep dogs and/or horses under proper control.<br>
5. Leave no litter. What goes out full can return empty.<br>
6. Avoid damaging fences, gates, etc.<br>
7. Ask permission to use private property BEFORE the<br>
expedition.<br>
8. Check and safeguard water supplies.<br>
9. Travel carefully on country roads.<br>
10. Protect wildlife, plants, and trees.<br>
11. Respect life of the countryside.<br>
NOTE: Permission must be obtained from the owner BEFORE<br>
the expedition to camp on private property.<br>
A Good Pathfinder Will<br>
Be conservation-minded<br>
I will help when and where I can to conserve our forests, waters,<br>
minerals, soil, grasslands, and wildlife.<br>
Be careful with fire<br>
I will build my fire in a safe place and keep it under control, and<br>
will be sure my fire is out before leaving it.<br>
Be clean in the out-of-doors<br>
I will not disturb the natural beauty by leaving my trash and<br>
garbage. I will not pollute rivers or streams.<br>
Be considerate of property<br>
144<br>
I will respect public and private property and do no damage. I<br>
will take nothing but photographs. I will leave nothing but<br>
footprints.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
3. Types of Camping<br>
Let's look now at two basic types of camping.<br>
a. Site camps<br>
b. Trave ling camps<br>
It is said, &quot;Variety is the spice of life.&quot; While this is not always true, it is<br>
fairly true of camping. To do the same thing over and over becomes<br>
monotonous and boring. Path finders, while they enjoy camping and will<br>
stick with the program, like adventure, challenge, and development of new<br>
skills. This is especially applicable to the older age group. The harder the<br>
challenge the more enjoyment they seem to get, especially when the<br>
challenge can be accomplished. It is damaging to set before a young person<br>
a goal that you know cannot be achieved. Always set realistic goals.<br>
&quot;Static&quot;<br>
The goals you set are determined by the type of camp you have. If you plan<br>
to teach your group abseiling or rappeling, then don't wear them out by<br>
having hiking, biking, canoeing, or other types of physically exhausting<br>
camps. Plan to concentrate your efforts in both theory and practice on<br>
achieving the goal. A site camp would be preferable for this goal, with<br>
transport readily available in an emergency. Try to achieve ONE major goal<br>
in a campout with subsidiary goals that point to the major goal.<br>
Remember that your site must be che cked out beforehand so that the goal<br>
you hope to achieve will be realized. Goals determine the site.<br>
Don't always find a nice site then work your campouts around that site.<br>
Good sites are hard to come by and it is easy to plan a camp once you have<br>
a site, but invariably you will find that the type of camp you offer will<br>
become stereotyped. This is all right for a new Club or for new Pathfinders,<br>
but it is not satisfactory for older members or for you as a leader to<br>
continue to do this. Both your older Pathfinders and your own initiative will<br>
soon be in a rut and the excitement of new horizons will become lost. Have<br>
you ever wondered, &quot;Why do kids enjoy camping so much when it seems<br>
such a lot of hard work and inconvenience?&quot; It just might be that you are<br>
already experiencing this syndrome. Plan to do something exciting,<br>
something different, and your enthusiasm will challenge the older Path-<br>
finders.<br>
a. Site Camp<br>
Let us list some of the types of camps that you could organize.<br>
It is good to have at least one each year. A site camp is simply a camp to<br>
which you drive your vehicles, erect your tents, camp at the samne place,<br>
then drive home at the conclusion of the camp. All activities focus<br>
around the site.<br>
These campouts are really good in that they help you to achieve a<br>
whole variety of things such as:<br>
Pathfinder classwork<br>
Swimming Honors<br>
Rock Climbing<br>
Hiking<br>
Fire building<br>
...20 (min.)<br>
Nature Honors<br>
(trees, ferns, flowers, etc.)<br>
Signaling<br>
Camperaft Honors<br>
Bible camps<br>
Axemanship<br>
Track and trail<br>
Lashings/knots<br>
Fire Building<br>
Orienteering<br>
146<br>
Make sure that there is a purpose to each campout you have, and that<br>
people are there with sufficient knowledge in particular areas to help<br>
you realize that purpose. Don't make your goal &quot;to have a good time.&quot;<br>
This must be a by-product of your camp, rather than an end in itself.<br>
Meeting new challenges, seeing new horizons, and developing new skills<br>
(which is cducation) providcs advcnturc that will cnsurc that cverybody<br>
has a good time. The balance betwveen what is done in 1) the theoretical<br>
way, and 2) a practical way, will largely determine the &quot;great time&quot; that<br>
was had.<br>
Don't overburden with theory, but make sure that sufficient has been<br>
learned to avoid pitfalls. They say &quot;a fool learns by his own mistakes<br>
but a wise man learns from the mistakes of fools.&quot;<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
b. Traveling Camps<br>
These camps move from one location to another and are designed to<br>
bring out initiative, reso urcefulness, courage, strength, and ability while<br>
putting into practice the things a Pathfinder has learned. Site camps can<br>
do this, too, but there is a challenge and a sense of achievement and<br>
adventure that can be gained on a traveling campout that cannot be<br>
achieved on a site campout. A Pathfinder has to learn to depend on his<br>
or her physical well being, knowledge and equipment to a far greater<br>
capacity, and in all these things sees the hand of God more clearly<br>
revealed. When you are halfway between point A and B, and are<br>
exhausted and feel that one more step will be your last, it is then that :<br>
person realizes his or her extremity and reaches out for help. At the<br>
conclusion of the campout that person has achieved the seemingly<br>
impossible but is determined to be more physically fit, have better<br>
equipment, and know more of what is to be done the next time.<br>
It is important to encourage the ones who drift to the rear and slow<br>
those who race to the front. The first hour or two will usually indicate<br>
what the general pattern will be, and it is important to check it before it<br>
gets out of control. It is wise to make an announcement that &quot;someone<br>
(who knows the way) will lead and &quot;'someone will bring up the rear. All<br>
Pathfinders must then be contained between these two leaders. This<br>
must be strictly enforced for the first day or two, depending on how long<br>
the group is going to travel. Nothing is more psychologically devastating<br>
to a traveling camper than to be always at the end of the line, and who<br>
knows what trouble they could be in if left to struggle while everyone<br>
else tears ahead. Sometimes these campers need to be put to the front.<br>
It is amazing how much faster they travel when they take the lead. It is<br>
not wise to scold, for that will cause even more disco uragement. It is<br>
better to play psychological games with everyone, thus encouraging all<br>
to be more helpful.<br>
The person who consistently barges ahead in the lead must be held back. He<br>
or she can get into all sorts of difficulty, and may be involved in an<br>
accident or get lost by such foolhardiness. That person also needs<br>
encouragement in being helpful to the group. Maybe he or she could carry a<br>
bit of extra weight from the slower ones or help the slower ones by walking<br>
with them and thus encouraging them or ministering to their needs.<br>
Whatever happens, it is essential that the group be contained and move<br>
forward as a group.<br>
It is important that all equipment taken on a travel campout be of good<br>
quality. Repairs along the way often make the poor quality article worse.<br>
Sometimes something can be rendered irreparable on the first day and<br>
you are then stuck without<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">An induction ceremony is a ceremony where Adventist Youth are admitted into the local Youth clubs and into the fellowship of the world wide Youth clubs. <br>
Youths and staff have the opportunity to publicly show their commitment to the principles and objectives of Youth clubs.<br>
                           <br>
Promises are made and principles are recited, at the end – Youths, staff and church members, leave with a sense of commitment and purpose<em>.</em><br>
                           <br>
After the recitations, anthems and devotion the induction starts:<br>
The Inducting Officer shall match smartly to the front and gives the brief introduction of the program and also declares the induction ceremony in order as he lights the Spirit of Adventist Youth Ministry The Inducting officer says the following words as he lights the Spirit, “For the light of our program we turn to the Spirit of Adventist Youth Ministry. It is the Spirit of Fellowship, Worship, Learning, Discipleship, Togetherness, and above all it is the Spirit of Service for God and man from which all the four Ministries get their power. <br>
                           <br>
Therefore, I will now be calling the Directors to come and start conducting the Induction ceremonies for their Clubs.<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Place a table in front of the Church. Put a large Pathfinder Emblem directly behind the table, with a Pathfinder Pledge banner on the right of the emblem and a Pathfinder Law banner to the left of the emblem. <br>
                           <br>
In the center of the table directly in front of the Pathfinder emblem place a White big candle to represent the spirit of Pathfinder Club. In front of this candle put six (06) candles–blue, red, green, silver (black), burgundy, and gold, which represent the six Pathfinder Classes. <br>
                           <br>
On the right of the Spirit candle place Seven (07) candles to represent the Pathfinder Pledge and Eight (08) candles on the left to represent the Pathfinder Law.<br>
                           <br>
Display the National Flag to the right (as you face the audience) of the table and a Pathfinder Flag to the left of the table.<br>
                           <br>
As the program starts, the Director, the Deputy and the Pathfinders match to the front in two files smartly. Then halt at least five (05) meters away from the table. The Director will advance and gets permission to conduct the induction from the Chief Marshal (Inducting Officer). <br>
                           <br>
Note: The Pathfinders for Pledge will be to the right and those for the Law will be to left as they face the table.<br>
                           <br>
The Director stands to the right of the table and the Deputy Director stands to the left of the table as they face the Pathfinders<br>
(The Deputy Director and the Pathfinders get permission from the Director)<br>
The Inducting Officer Sir, permission to conduct the induction ceremony for the Pathfinder Sir!<br>
                           <br>
After permission has be granted, and the director gives a brief on the pathfinder Club, and pronounces the induction ceremony in order for the club:<br>
“I hereby declare the induction ceremony of the ______________ Pathfinder Club now in order.”<br>
                           <br>
The director lights the “Spirit of Pathfinder Club” candle while saying:<br>
“For the light of our program we turn to the Spirit of Pathfinder Club. The candle that I now light represent this spirit. It is the spirit of Adventure, Fun, Learning, Comradeship Awareness, and Awakening, and above all, a spirit of Reverence and a Spirit of Service to God and man. This light is of itself not complete or sufficient. To introduce the complementary lights, we call on our Deputy Director.” (If possible mention his/her name)<br>

                           <br>
(Six (06) Pathfinders may present the following as well.)<br>
                           <br>
The Candle I now light represents:<br>
                           <strong>1. Friend Class</strong> is a course of study in learning, skills, and physical fitness that will help one to be a better neighbor now and a friend of God throughout eternity.<br>

                           <strong>6. Guide Class</strong> is a course of study that emphasizes personal growth and spiritual discoveries and prepares the Pathfinder for development of new skills in leadership and survival techniques.<br>
                           <br>
When the six Pathfinder Class candles have been lit, the director then explains to the candidate that the large candle is symbolic of the Pathfinder program, emphasizing the high ideals for which the club stands and the growth that the Pathfinder will make as a club member.<br>

                        </span><span style="color:#000000;">He then calls upon the Eight (08) Pathfinders one by one to proceed with the ceremony of lighting the Pathfinder Law candles.<br>
                           <br>
In turn, each of the eight Pathfinders marches smartly to the front, salutes the director with a hand salute, and lights one of the Pathfinder Law candles.<br>
                           <br>
After the Pathfinder lights the candle he again salutes the director and repeats, “Sir, I represent the candidate who hereby vows to: (repeats one of the following definitions according to the candle he has lit.”<br>

                           <strong>“Keep a level eye,”</strong> meaning I will not lie, cheat or deceive, and will despise dirty talk or evil thinking.<br>
                           <br>

                           <br>
When the Pathfinder Law candles have all been lit, the Deputy Director declares, “On behalf of the worldwide Pathfinder Club I accept the candidate’s vow to observe the Pathfinder Law.”<br>

After each candle is lit, the Pathfinder repeats to the director, <br>
“Sir, I represent the candidate, who pledges (repeats one of the following points according to the candle he has lit).”<br>
                           <br>
“<strong>By the grace of God,</strong>” meaning that only as I rely on God to help me, can I do His will.<br>
                           <br>
“<strong>I will be pure,</strong>” meaning I will not only be considerate and kind to my fellow men but also to all of God’s creation.<br>
                           <br>
“<strong>I will be kind</strong>” meaning that I will rise above the wicked world in which I live and keep my life clean with words and actions that will make others happy.<br>

“On behalf of the worldwide Pathfinder Club I accept the candidate’s vow to live by the Pathfinder Pledge.”<br>
                           <br>

I hereby declare the Induction Ceremony of the _________Ambassador Club now in order.<br>
                           <br>
For the light of our program, we turn to the Spirit of Adventist Youth. The candle which I now light represent this Spirit. It is the Spirit of adventure, fun, learning, comradely, awareness, and awakening, and above all, a spirit of reverence and a spirit of service to God and man. This light is of itself not complete or sufficient. To introduce the complimentary lights, we call on the Ambassador Deputy Leader.<br>

                           <br>
The Ambassador Deputy Director says the following:<br>
The Ambassador Club is an organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church dedicated to meeting the Spiritual, Social and lifestyle needs of the youths between the age of 16 and 21.<br>
                           <br>
The name ambassador itself suggests that they are representative of the Heavenly Kingdom. Therefore, the Ambassador program gives the Youths opportunity to learn, experience and share the relationship they have with Jesus to the world.<br>
To accomplish the Club’s objectives, the Ambassador program is based on Seven (07) foundations each presented into modules whose focus is based on Four (04) Elements.<br>

It represents the extension of the divine mandate of our Lord Jesus in a universal scope. It is a challenge to the youth to understand the divine command. Adventist youth can help in four different ways to finish the ask: Living consecrated lives, making themselves available for every opportunity to serve, praying for the Lord’s work both locally and worldwide, and giving sacrificially of their own financial means to spread the gospel and finish the Lord’s work. Thus they enter into true stewardship, giving their time, their talents, their means, and themselves.<br>

The Spirit of Adventist Youth candle represents the good things in the Adventist Youth program. It represents the high ideals for which the club stands and the growth that each Young Adult will make as a club member.<br>
We will now call on the candidate to come and light the candle which represents Adventist Youth Aim<br>
                           <br>
Sir/Madam, I represent the candidates whose Aim is, <br>
“To take the Advent message to all the world in my generation”.<br>
How universal and at the same time how definite is this Aim!<br>
                           <br>
“<strong>The message</strong>” is that which the youth will take.<br>
“<strong>To all the world</strong>” is where the youth will take the message.<br>
“<strong>In this generation</strong>” tells us when it will be taken.<br>
                           <br>
Adventist youth should not only know the Adventist message, they must know that Jesus will soon return and their lives must also give evidence that they really believe this aim.<br>

“The love of Christ compels us.”<br>
                           <br>
Inspired by this motto, Adventist youth all over the world, in harmony with the marvelous aim, move forward in the conquest of souls for the kingdom of God. <br>
The motto, based on 2 Cor. 5:14, is the motivating force in the Adventist youth movement. Without love there is only formation and certain failure. With the love of Christ success is sure, because it is a love that never deceives us. This is the love that always triumphs. It advances in the face of any difficulty, until the task is done, the conflict won, and the victory achieved.<br>
