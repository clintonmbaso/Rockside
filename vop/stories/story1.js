            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p><b>Jim</b> once asked an <i>atheist</i> if he had ever wrestled, even for a few moments, with the thought that maybe God does exist.</p>
                <p>“Absolutely!” the atheist said, to Jim’s surprise.</p>
            <blockquote>
            “Years ago when our first child was born I almost became a believer in God. 
                As I looked down at that miniature-but-perfect little human being in the crib, as I watched the flexing of those tiny fingers and saw the 
                dawning of recognition in those little eyes, I went through a period of several months during which I almost ceased to be an atheist. 
                Looking at that child almost convinced me there had to be a God.”

                <h2>EVERYTHING DESIGNED HAS A DESIGNER</h2>
<p>The design of the human body demands the existence of a designer. Scientists tell us 
that the brain stores and remembers thousands of mental images, integrates and solves 
problems, appreciates beauty, comprehends self, and desires to develop the best in each 
person. Electrical charges originating from the brain control all the muscular activity of our 
bodies.</p>
<p>Computers also function through electrical impulses. But it took a human mind to 
invent the computer and a human being to build the computer and tell it what to do.
No wonder the psalmist concluded that the human body speaks loud and clear of a 
wonderful Creator:
<blockquote>“I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are 
wonderful, I know that full well.”-Psalms 139:14.</blockquote>
<em class="em">(Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)</em>
<p>We don’t have to go far to find the “works” of God. The intricate design of the human 
brain and the other organs of our body are the “works” of God, and point to an infinitely 
skillful designer.</p>
<p>No pump built by man can compare with the human heart. No computer network can 
equal our nervous system. No television system is as efficient as the human voice, ear, and 
eye. No central air conditioning and heating system can match the work done by our nose, 
lungs, and skin. The complexity of the human body suggests that someone designed it, and 
that Someone is God.</p>
<p>The human body is a complete system of organs-all are interrelated, all thoroughly 
designed. The lungs and heart, nerves and muscles, all perform incredibly complicated tasks 
that depend on other incredibly complicated tasks.</p>
<p>If you were to mark ten coins from one to ten, put them in your pocket, shake them
around, and then pull them out and put them back in your pocket one by one, what is the 
likelihood you could do so in exact numerical sequence? By mathematical law you have 
only one chance in ten billion of taking them out in order from one to ten.</p>
<p>Now consider the chances of a stomach, brain, heart, liver, arteries, veins, kidneys, ears, 
eyes, and teeth all developing together and beginning to function at the same moment in 
time.</p>
<p>What is the most reasonable explanation for the design of the human body?<p>
<blockquote>“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,’… SO GOD 
CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE,… male and female he created them.”-Genesis 
1:26, 27.</blockquote>
<p>The first man and woman could not just have happened. The Bible affirms that God 
designed us in His image. He thought us up and brought us into being.</p>

                <h2>EVERYTHING MADE HAS A MAKER</h2>
                <p>But evidence for God is not confined to the design of our bodies; it’s also spread across 
the heavens. Leave the lights of the city, and look up into the night sky. That milky cloud 
beyond the stars that we call the Milky Way is really a galaxy of billions of blazing suns 
similar to our sun. In fact our sun and its planets are a part of the Milky Way. And our Milky 
Way is but one of an estimated more than one hundred billion galaxies that can be seen 
through giant telescopes on earth and through the Hubble telescope in space.</p>
<p>No wonder the psalmist concluded that the stars speak of a glorious Maker:</p>
<blockquote>
            “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.”-
Psalms 19:1-3.
</blockquote>
<p>What may we reasonably conclude by looking at the intricate design and vast size of 
the universe?</p>
<blockquote>
            “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”-Genesis 1:1 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
            “[God] is before all things, and in him all things hold together.”-Colossians 1:17.
</blockquote>
<p>All creation testifies about God the Master Designer and Infinite Creator. In the simple 
words, “in the beginning God”, we find the answer to the mystery of life. There is a God 
who created everything.</p>
<p>Many great scientific minds today believe in God. Dr. Arthur Compton, Nobel Prizewinning physicist, commenting on this verse of Scripture, once said:</p>
<blockquote>
            “For myself, faith begins with a realization that a supreme intelligence brought the 
universe into being and created man. It is not difficult for me to have this faith, for it is plain 
that where there is a plan there is a divine intelligence. An orderly, unfolding universe 
testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered-‘In the beginning God.’”
</blockquote>
            
<p>The Bible does not attempt to prove God-it declares His existence. Dr. Arthur Conklin, 
a noted biologist, once wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
            “The probability of life originating from an accident is 
comparable to the probability of an unabridged dictionary resulting from an explosion in a 
print shop.”
</blockquote>
<p>We know that human beings can’t make something from nothing. We may build things, 
invent things, put things together, but we have never brought into being from scratch even 
the tiniest frog or the simplest flower. The things about us cry out that God designed, God 
created, God sustains. The only believable answer to the origin of the universe, this world, 
and human beings-is God.</p>

                <h2>GOD COMES INTO PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE</h2>
                <p>The God who designed the starry heavens, who created the universe, seeks a personal 
relationship with us. He had a personal relationship with Moses:</p>
<blockquote>
            “The Lord would speak to Moses…as a man speaks with his friends” (Exodus 33:11).
</blockquote>
            <p>And God wants to enter into a personal relationship with you and become your friend.</p>
            <p>Jesus promised those who follow Him:</p>
<blockquote>“You are my friends” (John 15:14)</blockquote>
            <p>We have all wrestled with the idea of God, for humans are naturally religious. No animal 
ever builds an altar for worship. Yet everywhere you find men and women, you find them 
worshiping. Deep within every human heart is a natural desire to worship, an awareness of 
God, a desire to become a friend of God. When we respond to our longing and find God, 
there is no longer a doubt about His existence and our need.</p>
<p>During the 1990s millions of atheists in Russia renounced atheism and turned to God. 
A university professor in St. Petersburg made a statement that typifies the comments made 
by many transformed atheists in the former Soviet Union:</p>
<blockquote>
            “I have searched for a meaning to life in my scientific research, but found nothing to 
have confidence in. The scientists around me have the same empty feeling. As I looked at 
the vastness of the universe in my study of astronomy, and the emptiness of my soul, I felt 
there must be some meaning. Then, when I received the Bible you gave me and began 
reading it, the vacuum in my life was filled. I have found the Bible to be the only source of 
confidence to my soul. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior and have found true peace and 
satisfaction in life.”</blockquote>
<p>A Christian believes in God because he or she has met Him and discovers that He 
satisfies the heart’s deepest needs. The God whom Christians have joyfully found to exist, 
gives us a new perspective, new meaning, new motives, and new joys.
God doesn’t promise a life free from trouble and conflict, but He does assure us that He 
will guide and sustain us if we come into a personal relationship with Him. And millions of 
Christians will testify that they would give up everything rather than go back to a life without 
God</p>

            <p>This is the greatest wonder of all-that the Almighty God who designed, created, and 
sustains the universe also desires a personal relationship with every man and woman, boy 
and girl. David marveled at this, when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
            “When I consider heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which 
you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of Him?”-Psalms 8:3, 4.</blockquote>
<p>Our Creator is “mindful” of each one of us. He takes a personal interest in you as if you 
were the only one being He had created.</p>
<p>So we can believe in God:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because of the intricate design in everything He created 
about us.</li>
<li>Because of the longing for God within us that leaves us restless till we find our 
rest in Him. And,</li>
<li>Because when we seek and find Him, God satisfies our every need and 
longing-to the full!</li>

by telling wonderful bedtime stories.</p>
<p>Our loving Father wanted to do more than reveal Himself through the words of 
Scripture. He knew that a person we live with is much more real to us than someone we 
only hear about or read about in a book. So He came to our world as a real person-the person 
of Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>“[Jesus] is the image of the invisible God.”-Colossians 1:15.</blockquote>
<p>So if you have seen Jesus, you have seen God. He came down on our level-He became 
like us-so He could teach us how to live and be happy, and so we could see what God is 
really like. Jesus is God made visible. He Himself said, </p>
<blockquote>“Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father” (John 14:9).</blockquote>
<p>As you read the story of Jesus in the four Gospels, the first four books of the New 
Testament, you will discover a fascinating portrait of our heavenly Father. Rough Fishermen 
dropped their nets to follow Christ, and small children flocked to receive His blessings. He 
could comfort the most devastated sinner and disarm the most self-righteous hypocrite. He 
healed everything from blindness to leprosy. In all His actions Jesus demonstrated that God 
is love! He met human need in a way no one had ever done before Him-or has since!
Jesus’ final glorious revelation of what God is like happened at the cross.</p>
<blockquote>“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes 
in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”-John 3:16.</blockquote>
<p>Jesus died not only to give us a happier life now, but also to give us eternal life. For 
long ages people wondered, and hoped, and dreamed about God. They saw His handiwork 
in the sky and in the beauties of nature. Then at the cross, Jesus broke the silence of the ages, 
and people found themselves looking into the very face of God, seeing Him as He really islove, eternal and immortal love!
You can discover God right now as Jesus reveals Him. That discovery will lead you to 
make a very personal affirmation:</p>
<blockquote>“Father, I love you!”
