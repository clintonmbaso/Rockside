        <p><strong>Read for This Week’s Study:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 15:42-47">Mark 15:42-47</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Colossians 2:10-12">Colossians 2:10-12</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 15:1-8">1 Corinthians 15:1-8</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Daniel 9:24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            “But he said to them, ‘Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:6">Mark 16:6</span></strong>, NKJV).
        </blockquote>
        <p>The crucifixion of Jesus destroyed the hopes and faith of His disciples. It was a dark weekend for them as they not only grappled with their Master’s death but feared for their own lives, as well (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:19">John 20:19</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>In <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong>, the final chapter in this Gospel, we will look at what followed His death.</p>
        <p>First, we will examine the timing of Jesus’ resurrection and why the women came to the tomb on that Sunday morning. Adventists have sometimes shied away from resurrection morning because of the way it is misused to support Sunday sacredness. We will instead see how we can rejoice in the Sunday resurrection, despite the false theology that has, unfortunately, arisen from it.</p>
        <p>Second, the lesson explains the first verses of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong>, linking these words to a theme that runs through the entire book. Our studies on Monday and Tuesday will look at these concepts.</p>
        <p>Third, Wednesday and Thursday will examine the rest of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong> and consider the mission it sets before us. This study will close with a challenge to the reader of Mark to take the gospel throughout the world.</p>

    title: "Rejoicing in the Resurrection",
    text: `
        <p>All the Gospel writers agree that Jesus died on the day that they identify as the “preparation” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 27:62">Matthew 27:62</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 15:42">Mark 15:42</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 23:54">Luke 23:54</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:14, 31, 42">John 19:14, 31, 42</span></strong>). Most commentators understand this as a reference to sunset Thursday through sunset Friday. Jesus died late on Friday afternoon and was then quickly buried before sunset.</p>
        <p>During the Sabbath, the Lord rested in the grave, and all of Jesus’ disciples rested as well. “And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 23:56">Luke 23:56</span></strong>, NKJV), a rather strange action if, in fact, Jesus had lessened, at least in their minds, the obligation to keep the fourth commandment.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, the women bought spices, and on Sunday morning, they went to the tomb with the desire to complete the typical burial process. Of course, Jesus was not there!</p>
        <p>As early as the second century, Christians saw significance in the fact that Jesus rose on Sunday. This became the basis for Sunday sacredness. But is that what the New Testament teaches?</p>
        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Colossians 2:10-12">Colossians 2:10-12</span></strong>. What is the New Testament memorial of Jesus’ resurrection?</p>
        <p>Not a word in the Bible hints at Sunday sacredness as a memorial of the Resurrection. That memorial is baptism. “Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 6:4">Romans 6:4</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>
        <p>Regardless of the false theology regarding Sunday worship, as Adventists we must rejoice in the Sunday morning resurrection of Jesus. Jesus has triumphed over death, and in His resurrection, we have the surety of ours.</p>
        <p>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Peter 1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span></strong>, NKJV). Look at the certainty Paul had about the resurrection of Jesus. How can we have that certainty, as well?</p>

    title: "The Stone Was Rolled Away",
    text: `
        <p>The story of the resurrection appears in each of the Gospels. Each Gospel writer presents the story from a different perspective, but they all contain the core concepts that appear also in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 15:1-8">1 Corinthians 15:1-8</span></strong>.</p>
        <p>Four ideas appear again and again—died, buried, risen, seen. In Mark, “died” and “buried” are in chapter 15. The “risen” and “seen” appear in chapter 16, but with a twist. <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:7">Mark 16:7</span></strong> speaks of a meeting in Galilee, and there you will see Him (see <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 21">John 21</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>Some people find it incredible that Christians believe in a risen Lord. But the evidence for His resurrection is substantial and consistent with reason.</p>
        <p>For starters, all one has to do is believe in God as the Creator (see <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span></strong>) and the idea of the resurrection, of a miracle, becomes reasonable. The God who created the universe, and then life on earth, certainly had the power, if He chose, to resurrect Jesus. The existence of God doesn’t make the resurrection of Jesus inevitable, only reasonable.</p>
        <p>Next, the tomb was definitely empty. Even atheist historians accept that fact. If it were not, the claim about His resurrection would fail right from the start because the existence of His body there would destroy any claims of His having risen.</p>
        <p>Next, the explanation that His disciples stole the body does not work. The disciples surely couldn’t have gotten past the guards. And even if they had done so and got the body, why were the disciples never arrested for stealing it? The answer is that the religious leaders knew that the disciples had not done it.</p>
        <p>Also, numerous people testified that they saw the risen Christ. Many, including the disciples, did not at first believe. And one very solid enemy, Paul, not only claims to have seen the risen Lord but that this experience changed the whole trajectory of his life—in very radical ways, too.</p>
        <p>Finally (though there are many other reasons), how does one explain the rise of the Christian church, founded by people who claimed to have seen the risen Lord? Why would these people have been willing to die for what they knew was a lie? Their consistent testimony, both right after His death (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 3:15">Acts 3:15</span></strong>) and years later (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Peter 1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span></strong>), provides powerful evidence for His resurrection.</p>
        <p>If someone were to ask you, What evidence do you have for Christ’s resurrection, what would you say?</p>

    title: "The Women at the Tomb",
    text: `
        <p>“The women who had stood by the cross of Christ waited and watched for the hours of the Sabbath to pass. On the first day of the week, very early, they made their way to the tomb, taking with them precious spices to anoint the Saviour’s body. They did not think about His rising from the dead. The sun of their hope had set, and night had settled down on their hearts. As they walked, they recounted Christ's works of mercy and His words of comfort. But they remembered not His words, ‘I will see you again.’” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 16:22">John 16:22</span></strong>) — Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 788.</p>
        <p><strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:1-8">Mark 16:1-8</span></strong> recounts that the women came to the tomb to anoint Jesus’ body. They found the stone rolled away and were told by an angel that Jesus had risen. At first, they were frightened and fled, telling no one of what they had seen.</p>
        <p>From the beginning of Mark’s Gospel, the reader knows that Jesus is the Messiah. However, the first non-demon-possessed person to proclaim Him the Messiah is Peter in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 8:29">Mark 8:29</span></strong>, which happens halfway through the book.</p>
        <p>Throughout Mark, Jesus tells people to keep quiet about His identity and miracles. He tells a leper to stay silent in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 1:44">Mark 1:44</span></strong>, Jairus and his wife after their daughter's resurrection in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 5:43">Mark 5:43</span></strong>, and those present at the healing of the deaf and mute man in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 7:36">Mark 7:36</span></strong>. He even commands His disciples not to reveal He is the Messiah (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 8:30">Mark 8:30</span></strong>; see also <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 9:9">Mark 9:9</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>The reason for this was likely to ensure that Jesus completed His ministry according to the time prophecies in Daniel 9:24-27. But after the Resurrection, even though the women were initially afraid to speak, their silence did not last long.</p>
        <p>By the end of Mark’s Gospel, we read, “And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:20">Mark 16:20</span></strong>, ESV).</p>
        <p>The motif of silence about Jesus is shattered. The book concludes with the disciples spreading the good news of His resurrection and what He has done.</p>
        <p>Why must we not keep silent about Jesus and what He has done? Who can you tell today about Jesus and the plan of salvation?</p>

    title: "Appearing to Mary and Others",
    text: `
        <p>Almost all of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:9-20">Mark 16:9-20</span></strong> has parallels to other passages in the New Testament—Mary Magdalene at the tomb seeing Jesus (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:1, 9, 10">Matthew 28:1, 9, 10</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span></strong>; compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 8:2">Luke 8:2</span></strong>); two disciples see Him in the countryside (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 24:13-35">Luke 24:13-35</span></strong>); the 11 disciples are commissioned (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:16-20">Matthew 28:16-20</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 24:36-49">Luke 24:36-49</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:19-23">John 20:19-23</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>The first person to see Jesus alive was Mary Magdalene (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span></strong>). Other women saw Him as well (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:8-10">Matthew 28:8-10</span></strong>). It is significant that the first people to see the risen Lord were women. In the ancient world, women did not have high status as witnesses. If the story were fabricated, it would have been much more likely to name men as the first witnesses. But it is not men, not the 11, but a woman who first sees Jesus. She goes to tell the good news to the disciples, but, not surprisingly, they do not believe her testimony, most likely because it seemed fantastic and also, unfortunately, because Mary was a woman.</p>
        <p>Apologists for the resurrection story of Jesus have used this fact—that women were the first to see Jesus—as powerful evidence for the veracity of the story.</p>
        <p>In <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:14">Mark 16:14</span></strong>, Jesus rebukes the 11 disciples for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen. This makes no sense if the story were a fabrication. Why rebuke the disciples for something the author could have easily written differently?</p>

    title: "Go Into All the World",
    text: `
        <p>The first words of Jesus to His disciples are recorded only in indirect discourse in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:14">Mark 16:14</span></strong>. He rebukes them for their unbelief and hardheartedness. This question of unbelief is not simply a modern problem. As we already have seen, the original disciples of Jesus struggled with belief (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:17">Matthew 28:17</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:24-29">John 20:24-29</span></strong>), and they were with Jesus in the flesh and saw, again and again, the miracles.</p>
        <p>But by various proofs, He demonstrated to them the reality of His resurrection. Their testimony, combined with the evidence summarized earlier, forms a firm foundation for faith.</p>
        <p>Jesus then commissions His disciples to take the gospel to the world. His command is expansive: they are to go to the entire world and proclaim the gospel to all creation. Jesus explains the outcome of their work—believers will be saved, unbelievers condemned.</p>
        <p>Jesus also describes signs that will accompany the disciples’ work—casting out demons, speaking new languages, protection from harm, and healing the sick. Some have mistakenly interpreted <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:18">Mark 16:18</span></strong> as a call for Christians to prove their faith by handling venomous snakes. However, no such action is authorized here. Jesus describes protection in mission, as shown in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 28:3-6">Acts 28:3-6</span></strong> when Paul was unharmed after a snake bite.</p>
        <p>The Bible does not teach that Christians will always be protected from harm. Sometimes God works miracles to further the gospel, while other times Christians may suffer for their witness. In such moments, their endurance becomes a testimony of faith to unbelievers.</p>
        <p>After His words, “He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:19">Mark 16:19</span></strong>, NKJV). Jesus ascended to the place of supreme power, having defeated all the forces of evil.</p>
        <p>Notice the final verse: though the disciples went “everywhere,” preaching the gospel, they did not go alone. “The Lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying signs. Amen” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:20">Mark 16:20</span></strong>, NKJV). He was with them then, and He promises to be with us as we continue their work.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I am with you always, even to the end of the age’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:20">Matthew 28:20</span></strong>, NKJV). What comfort can we take from this promise as we, too, seek to proclaim the gospel everywhere?</p>

    text: `
        <p>Read Ellen G. White, <em>‘The Lord Is Risen,’</em> pp. 779–787; <em>‘Go Teach All Nations,’</em> pp. 818–828, in <em>The Desire of Ages</em>.</p>
        <p>“To the believer, Christ is the resurrection and the life. In our Saviour the life that was lost through sin is restored; for He has life in Himself to quicken whom He will. He is invested with the right to give immortality. The life that He laid down in humanity, He takes up again, and gives to humanity. ‘I am come,’ He said, ‘that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.’ ‘Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.’ ‘Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.’ <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:10">John 10:10</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:14">John 4:14</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:54">John 6:54</span></strong>.</p>
        <p>“To the believer, death is but a small matter. Christ speaks of it as if it were of little moment. ‘If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death,’ ‘he shall never taste of death.’ To the Christian, death is but a sleep, a moment of silence and darkness. The life is hid with Christ in God, and ‘when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.’ <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:51-52">John 8:51, 52</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Colossians 3:4">Colossians 3:4</span></strong>.”—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, pp. 786, 787.</p>
        <p>Even atheist historians, those who cannot accept the reality of the Resurrection, admit not only that Jesus had been killed but that after His death many people claimed to have seen the resurrected Christ, and as a result they began the nucleus of what became the Christian church. Some, in an attempt to explain why they claimed this, said that Jesus had a twin brother or that the early disciples hallucinated, thinking that they saw Jesus. Others said that Jesus never really died but only swooned and then, later, revived. Another person claimed that aliens came down and took the body. For a look at all these arguments and how they don’t work, see Clifford Goldstein, <em>Risen: Finding Hope in the Empty Tomb</em> (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press, 2021).</p>
        <h3>Discussion Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Why would the disciples have lied about the resurrection of Jesus? From all that we know, they faced nothing but hatred, alienation, and persecution for their belief. What would they have gained by making this story up?</li>

            <li>Dwell more on the great hope that Jesus’ resurrection offers us. Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 15">1 Corinthians 15</span></strong>. How much importance does Paul put on the resurrection of Jesus?</li>
