<h2>First Overseas Missionary</h2>

<p>For several years, <strong>"Macedonian"</strong> calls had been coming to the General Conference from <strong>Switzerland</strong>. M. B. Czechowski, a converted Catholic priest, had traveled on his own under another sponsorship, spreading the message of the second advent along with other beliefs held by our church, including the <strong>seventh-day Sabbath</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, at the General Conference session of <strong>1874</strong>, a significant official forward action was taken. <strong>John Nevins Andrews</strong> was appointed the <strong>first official overseas missionary</strong> and was sent to <strong>Switzerland</strong>. His son <strong>Charles</strong>, 17, and daughter <strong>Mary</strong>, 13, sailed with him; his wife had passed away in <strong>1872</strong>.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival, the <strong>European Mission</strong> was organized. Andrews also reached <strong>Prussia</strong> in <strong>1875</strong> and reported having found a group of <strong>46 Sabbathkeepers</strong> there.</p>

<h2>Work Spreads Across Europe</h2>

<p><strong>Scandinavia</strong> was entered in <strong>1877</strong> by <strong>John Matteson</strong>, and a publishing house was opened two years later. <strong>D. T. Bourdeau</strong> was assigned to consolidate the work in <strong>France</strong>. His brother, <strong>A. C. Bourdeau</strong>, worked in <strong>Italy</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, and <strong>Romania</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Philipp Reiswig</strong>, a man who was uneducated and with a speech impediment, was used in a special way by God to carry the message into <strong>Russia</strong>.</p>

<h2>Work Established in Great Britain</h2>

<p><strong>William Ings</strong> went to <strong>England</strong> in <strong>1878</strong> and in only <strong>16 weeks</strong> had ten people keeping the Sabbath. Later that same year, <strong>Elder Loughborough</strong> arrived to lead out, and in time the <strong>Stanborough Press</strong> and <strong>Newbold College</strong> were established.</p>

<p>These countries each in turn became a home base, sending out missionaries to other lands.</p>
