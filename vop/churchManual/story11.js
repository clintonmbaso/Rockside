                <h2>General Principles</h2>
                <p>The apostle John declared that “true worshipers will worship the Father 
in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him” (John 4:23).
“Although God dwells not in temples made with hands, yet He honors 
with His presence the assemblies of His people. He has promised that when 
they come together to seek Him, to acknowledge their sins, and to pray for 
one another, He will meet with them by His Spirit. But those who assemble 
to worship Him should put away every evil thing. Unless they worship Him 
in spirit and truth and in the beauty of holiness, their coming together will be 
of no avail.”—PK 50.
Purpose of Services and Meetings—The purpose of all services and 
meetings is to worship God for His creative work and for the benefits of His 
salvation; to understand His Word, His teachings, and His purposes; to 
fellowship in faith and love; to witness about our personal faith in Christ’s 
atoning sacrifice at the cross; and to learn how to fulfill the gospel 
commission of making disciples in all the world (Matt. 28:19, 20).
Reverence for the House of Worship—“To the humble, believing 
soul, the house of God on earth is the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the 
prayer, the words spoken by Christ’s representatives, are God’s appointed 
agencies to prepare a people for the church above, for that loftier worship into 
which there can enter nothing that defileth.
“From the sacredness which was attached to the earthly sanctuary, 
Christians may learn how they should regard the place where the Lord meets 
with His people. . . . God Himself gave the order of His service, exalting it 
high above everything of a temporal nature.
“The house is the sanctuary for the family, and the closet or the grove 
the most retired place for individual worship; but the church is the sanctuary 
for the congregation. There should be rules in regard to the time, the place,
and the manner of worshiping. Nothing that is sacred, nothing that pertains 
to the worship of God, should be treated with carelessness or indifference.”—
5T 491.
Teach Children Reverence—“Parents, elevate the standard of 
Christianity in the minds of your children; help them to weave Jesus into their 
experience; teach them to have the highest reverence for the house of God 
and to understand that when they enter the Lord’s house it should be with 
hearts that are softened and subdued by such thoughts as these: ‘God is here; 
this is His house. I must have pure thoughts and the holiest motives. I must 
have no pride, envy, jealousy, evil surmising, hatred, or deception in my 
heart, for I am coming into the presence of the holy God. This is the place 
where God meets with and blesses His people. The high and holy One who 
inhabiteth eternity looks upon me, searches my heart, and reads the most 
secret thoughts and acts of my life.’ ”—5T 494.
Decorum and Quietness in the Place of Worship—“When the 
worshipers enter the place of meeting, they should do so with decorum, 
passing quietly to their seats. . . . Common talking, whispering, and laughing 
should not be permitted in the house of worship, either before or after the 
service. Ardent, active piety should characterize the worshipers.
“If some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting begins, let them 
maintain a true spirit of devotion by silent meditation, keeping the heart 
uplifted to God in prayer that the service may be of special benefit to their 
own hearts and lead to the conviction and conversion of other souls. They 
should remember that heavenly messengers are in the house. . . . If when the 
people come into the house of worship, they have genuine reverence for the 
Lord and bear in mind that they are in His presence, there will be a sweet 
eloquence in silence. The whispering and laughing and talking which might 
be without sin in a common business place should find no sanction in the 
house where God is worshiped. The mind should be prepared to hear the 
Word of God, that it may have due weight and suitably impress the heart.”—
5T 492.
Hospitality—“Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some 
have unwittingly entertained angels” (Heb. 13:2). Every church should 
cultivate a spirit of hospitality, an essential element of Christian life and 
experience. Nothing is so deadening to the spiritual life of a church as a cold, 
formal atmosphere that drives out hospitality and Christian fellowship. 
Especially selected greeters should cordially welcome visitors, who also may 
be welcomed at the time of the worship service.

                <h2>Place of Music in Worship</h2>
                <p>Power of Music—“Music can be a great power for good, yet we do not 
make the most of this branch of worship. The singing is generally done from 
impulse or to meet special cases, and at other times those who sing are left to 
blunder along, and the music loses its proper effect upon the minds of those 
present. Music should have beauty, pathos, and power. Let the voices be lifted 
in songs of praise and devotion. Call to your aid, if practicable, instrumental 
music, and let the glorious harmony ascend to God, an acceptable 
offering.”—4T 71.
            
Sing With Spirit and Understanding—“In their efforts to reach the 
people, the Lord’s messengers are not to follow the ways of the world. In the 
meetings that are held, they are not to depend on worldly singers and 
theatrical display to awaken an interest. How can those who have no interest 
in the Word of God, who have never read His Word with a sincere desire to 
understand its truths, be expected to sing with the spirit and the 
understanding? . . . How can the heavenly choir join in music that is only a 
form? . . . “The singing is not always to be done by a few. As often as possible, 
let the entire congregation join.”—9T 143, 144.

                <h2>Pulpit Not a Forum</h2>
                <p>The Church confers no right to any pastor, elder, or other person to make 
the pulpit a forum for advocating disputed points of doctrine or church 
procedure.
Testing New Light—Members who think they have new light contrary 
to the established views of the Church should seek counsel from responsible 
leaders.
“There are a thousand temptations in disguise prepared for those who 
have the light of truth; and the only safety for any of us is in receiving no new 
doctrine, no new interpretation of the Scriptures, without first submitting it 
to brethren of experience. Lay it before them in a humble, teachable spirit, 
with earnest prayer; and if they see no light in it, yield to their judgment; for 
‘in the multitude of counselors there is safety.’ ”—5T 293. (See also Acts 
15:1-32.)
This plan was followed in the early church. When a difference of opinion 
arose at Antioch over an important question, the believers sent 
representatives to Jerusalem to submit the question to the apostles and elders
The believers in Antioch joyfully accepted the decision of the Jerusalem 
Council, thus preserving unity and brotherly love.
The counsel to test new light must not be regarded as deterring anyone 
from diligently studying the Scriptures, but rather as a protection against the 
infiltration of false theories and erroneous doctrines into the Church. God 
wants His children faithfully to search His Word for light and truth, but He 
does not want them to be led astray by false teachings.
“We have seen only the glimmering of divine glory and of the infinitude 
of knowledge and wisdom; we have, as it were, been working on the surface 
of the mine, when rich golden ore is beneath the surface, to reward the one 
who will dig for it. The shaft must be sunk deeper and yet deeper in the mine, 
and the result will be glorious treasure. Through a correct faith, divine 
knowledge will become human knowledge.”—COL 113.
“New light will ever be revealed on the Word of God to him who is in 
living connection with the Sun of Righteousness. Let no one come to the 
conclusion that there is no more truth to be revealed. The diligent, prayerful 
seeker for truth will find precious rays of light yet to shine forth from the 
Word of God. Many gems are yet scattered that are to be gathered together 
to become the property of the remnant people of God.”—CSW 34.
When new light shines forth from the sacred page to reward the earnest 
seeker after truth, it does not make void the old. Instead it merges with the 
old, causing it to grow brighter with added luster. Therefore, “the path of the 
just is like the shining sun, that shines ever brighter unto the perfect day” 
(Prov. 4:18).
Although the child of God must stand ready to accept advancing light, 
one must never give heed to any voice, however pious and plausible, that 
would lead away from the fundamental doctrines of the Bible.
“We are not to receive the words of those who come with a message that 
contradicts the special points of our faith. They gather together a mass of 
Scripture, and pile it as proof around their asserted theories. This has been 
done over and over again during the past fifty years. And while the Scriptures 
are God’s Word, and are to be respected, the application of them, if such 
application moves one pillar from the foundation that God has sustained these 
fifty years, is a great mistake. He who makes such an application knows not 
the wonderful demonstration of the Holy Spirit that gave power and force to 
the past messages that have come to the people of God.”—CW 32.

                <h2>Importance of Maintaining Unity</h2>
                <p>It is important that we maintain “the unity of the faith” (Eph. 4:13), and 
just as important that we seek to “keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of 
peace” (verse 3). Such unity requires caution and counsel with church 
leadership.
“God is leading a people out from the world upon the exalted platform 
of eternal truth, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. He will 
discipline and fit up His people. They will not be at variance, one believing 
one thing and another having faith and views entirely opposite, each moving 
independently of the body. Through the diversity of the gifts and 
governments that He has placed in the church, they will all come to the unity 
of the faith. If one man takes his views of Bible truth without regard to the 
opinion of his brethren, and justifies his course, alleging that he has a right to 
his own peculiar views, and then presses them upon others, how can he be 
fulfilling the prayer of Christ? . . .
“Though we have an individual work and an individual responsibility 
before God, we are not to follow our own independent judgment, regardless 
of the opinions and feelings of our brethren; for this course would lead to 
disorder in the church. It is the duty of ministers to respect the judgment of 
their brethren; but their relations to one another, as well as the doctrines they 
teach, should be brought to the test of the law and the testimony; then, if 
hearts are teachable, there will be no divisions among us. Some are inclined 
to be disorderly, and are drifting away from the great landmarks of the faith; 
but God is moving upon His ministers to be one in doctrine and in spirit.”—
TM 29, 30.
In view of these considerations, it is evident that the pulpit must be 
reserved for the preaching of the truths of the Divine Word and the 
presentation of denominational plans and policies for the advancement of the 
work of God, not personal views and opinions. (See pp. 34, 124-125.)
Authorized Speakers—Only speakers worthy of confidence will be 
invited to the pulpit by the local church pastor, in harmony with guidelines 
given by the conference. (See “Terms Used in the Church Manual,” pp. 19-
20.) The local elders or church board may also invite speakers, in consultation 
with the pastor, and in harmony with conference guidelines. Individuals who 
are no longer members, or who are under discipline, should not be given 
access to the pulpit.
            
At times it is acceptable for government officials or civic leaders to 
address a congregation, but all others should be excluded from the pulpit 
unless permission is granted by the conference. Every pastor, elder, and 
conference president must enforce this rule. (See pp. 34, 124-125.)

                <h2>Sabbath School and Worship Services</h2>
                <p>Sabbath School—The Sabbath School, one of our most important 
services, is the church at study. Every Sabbath our members and thousands 
of interested friends meet in Sabbath School to study God’s Word 
systematically. All members of the church should be encouraged to attend 
Sabbath School and bring visitors.
Each Sabbath School should endeavor to provide appropriate age-level 
programs. Materials and resources are available from the conference, union, 
and division.
Sabbath School should promote local and worldwide mission activities, 
the mission offering, and significant time for Bible study. (See Notes, #1, 
pp. 185-186.)
Announcements and Departmental Promotions—Thoughtful 
consideration should be given to the length and character of the 
announcements and departmental promotions during Sabbath services. If 
they deal with matters not specifically related to Sabbath worship or the work 
of the church, pastors and officers should exclude them, maintaining even in 
this respect a proper spirit of worship and Sabbath observance.
Many churches issue printed bulletins giving the order of service and 
also the announcements for the week. Where this is done, there is little or no 
need for oral announcements. Where no such printed provision is made, many 
churches make the announcements before the worship service begins. (See 
Notes, #2, p. 186.)
Proper consideration also should be given for the various departments to 
promote their programs, but great care should be exercised to safeguard the 
time needed for studying and preaching the Word of God.
Worship Service—The Sabbath worship service is the most important 
church meeting. Here members gather weekly to unite in worshipping God 
in a spirit of praise and thanksgiving, to hear the Word of God, to gather 
strength and grace to fight the battles of life, and to learn God’s will for them 
in soul-winning service. Reverence, simplicity, and promptness should 
characterize the service.
Skill, Study, and Planning Required—“Is it not your duty to put some 
skill and study and planning into the matter of conducting religious 
meetings—how they shall be conducted so as to do the greatest amount of 
good, and leave the very best impression upon all who attend?”—RH, 
Apr. 14, 1885.
“Our God is a tender, merciful Father. His service should not be looked 
upon as a heart-saddening, distressing exercise. It should be a pleasure to
worship the Lord and to take part in His work. . . . Christ and Him crucified 
should be the theme of contemplation, of conversation, and of our most joyful 
emotion. . . . As we express our gratitude we are approximating to the worship 
of the heavenly hosts. ‘Whoso offereth praise glorifieth’ God. Psalm 50:23. 
Let us with reverent joy come before our Creator, with ‘thanksgiving, and the 
voice of melody.’ Isaiah 51:3.”—SC 103, 104.
Form of Service—The Sabbath morning service has two main 
divisions: the congregational response in praise and adoration, expressed in 
song, prayer, and gifts, and the message from the Word of God. (See Notes, 
#3, pp. 186-187.)
There is no set form or order for public worship. A short order of service 
is usually better suited to the real spirit of worship. Long preliminaries should 
be avoided. The opening exercises should not consume time required for the 
preaching of the Word of God. (For suggested forms of service, see Notes, 
#2, p. 186.)
Church Outreach (Missionary) Service—The first Sabbath of each 
month is the Church Outreach (Missionary) Sabbath. This worship service 
focuses on lay evangelism and may feature plans and activities of various 
departments. “God has committed to our hands a most sacred work, and we 
need to meet together to receive instruction, that we may be fitted to perform 
this work.”—6T 32. (See Notes, #4, pp. 187-198.)
Public Prayer—“Christ impressed upon His disciples the idea that their 
prayers should be short, expressing just what they wanted, and no more. . . . 
One or two minutes is long enough for any ordinary prayer.”—2T 581.
“Let those who pray and those who speak pronounce their words 
properly and speak in clear, distinct, even tones. Prayer, if properly offered, 
is a power for good. It is one of the means used by the Lord to communicate 
to the people the precious treasures of truth. . . . Let God’s people learn how 
to speak and pray in a way that will properly represent the great truths they
possess. Let the testimonies borne and the prayers offered be clear and 
distinct. Thus God will be glorified.”—6T 382.
Supplying Literature on Sabbath—Generally Sabbath is the 
opportune time for the personal ministries secretary to place literature in the 
hands of members. Objectionable methods that divert the attention from true 
worship and reverence should be avoided.

                <h2>Communion Service</h2>
                <p>The communion service customarily is celebrated once per quarter. The 
service includes the ordinance of foot-washing followed by the Lord’s 
Supper. It should be a most sacred and joyous occasion to the congregation, 
pastor, and elders. The service usually takes place during the worship service 
but may be scheduled at other times.
Ordinance of Foot-Washing—“Now, having washed the disciples’ 
feet, He said, ‘I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done 
to you.’ In these words Christ was not merely enjoining the practice of 
hospitality. More was meant than the washing of the feet of guests to remove 
the dust of travel. Christ was here instituting a religious service. By the act of 
our Lord this . . . ceremony was made a consecrated ordinance. It was to be 
observed by the disciples, that they might ever keep in mind His lessons of 
humility and service.
“This ordinance is Christ’s appointed preparation for the sacramental 
service. While pride, variance, and strife for supremacy are cherished, the 
heart cannot enter into fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared to receive 
the communion of His body and His blood. Therefore it was that Jesus 
appointed the memorial of His humiliation to be first observed.”—DA 650.
In the act of washing the disciples’ feet, Christ performed a deeper 
cleansing, that of washing from the heart the stain of sin. The communicants 
sense an unworthiness to accept the sacred emblems before experiencing the 
cleansing that makes them “completely clean” (John 13:10). Jesus desired to 
wash away “alienation, jealousy, and pride from their hearts. . . . Pride and 
self-seeking create dissension and hatred, but all this Jesus washed away. . . . 
Looking upon them, Jesus could say, ‘Ye are clean.’ ”—DA 646.
The spiritual experience that lies at the heart of foot-washing lifts it from 
being a common custom to being a sacred ordinance. It conveys a message 
of forgiveness, acceptance, assurance, and solidarity, primarily from Christ 
to the believer, but also between the believers themselves. This message is 
expressed in an atmosphere of humility.
The Lord’s Supper—Angels declare that Jesus, the Redeemer of this 
world, is holy. Likewise, the symbols representing His body and His blood 
are holy. Since the Lord Himself selected the deeply meaningful symbols of 
the unleavened bread and unfermented fruit of the vine and used the simplest 
of means for washing the disciples’ feet, there should be great reluctance to 
introduce alternative symbols and means, except under emergency 
conditions, lest the original significance of the service be lost. Likewise in 
the order of service and the traditional roles played by the pastor, elders, 
deacons, and deaconesses, there should be caution lest substitution and 
innovation tend to make common that which is sacred.
The service of the Lord’s Supper is just as holy today as it was when 
instituted by Jesus Christ. Jesus is still present when this sacred ordinance is 
celebrated. “It is at these, His own appointments, that Christ meets His 
people, and energizes them by His presence.”—DA 656.
Unleavened Bread and Unfermented Wine (Grape Juice)—“Christ 
is still at the table on which the paschal supper has been spread. The 
unleavened cakes used at the Passover season are before Him. The Passover 
wine, untouched by fermentation, is on the table. These emblems Christ 
employs to represent His own unblemished sacrifice. Nothing corrupted by 
fermentation, the symbol of sin and death, could represent the ‘Lamb without 
blemish and without spot.’ 1 Peter 1:19.”—DA 653.
Neither the wine nor the bread contained elements of fermentation 
because on the evening of the first day of the Hebrew Passover all leaven, or 
fermentation, had been removed from their dwellings (Ex. 12:15, 19; 13:7). 
Therefore, only unfermented grape juice and unleavened bread are 
appropriate for use in the communion service, and great care must be 
exercised in providing these elements. In isolated areas where grape or raisin 
juice or concentrate is unavailable, the conference office will advise or assist.
A Memorial of the Crucifixion—“As we receive the bread and wine 
symbolizing Christ’s broken body and spilled blood, we in imagination join 
in the scene of Communion in the upper chamber. We seem to be passing 
through the garden consecrated by the agony of Him who bore the sins of the 
world. We witness the struggle by which our reconciliation with God was 
obtained. Christ is set forth crucified among us.”—DA 661
A Proclamation of the Second Coming—“The Communion service 
points to Christ’s second coming. It was designed to keep this hope vivid in 
the minds of the disciples. Whenever they met together to commemorate His 
death, they recounted how ‘he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to 
them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new testament, 
which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will 
not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it 
new with you in my Father’s kingdom.’ In their tribulation they found 
comfort in the hope of their Lord’s return. Unspeakably precious to them was 
the thought, ‘As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the 
Lord’s death till he come.’ 1 Cor. 11:26.”—DA 659.
Announcing the Communion Service—The communion service may 
appropriately be included as part of any Christian worship service. However, 
to give proper emphasis and make communion available to the greatest 
number of members, usually it is part of the worship service on the next to 
the last Sabbath of each quarter.
On the preceding Sabbath an announcement should be made of the 
service calling attention to the importance of the forthcoming communion, so 
that all members may prepare their hearts and put aright any unresolved 
differences they have with one another. When they come to the table of the 
Lord the following Sabbath, they then can receive the intended blessing. 
Those absent for the announcement also should be invited to attend.
Conducting the Communion Service—Length of Service—Time is 
not the most significant factor in the communion service. However, 
attendance can be improved and the spiritual impact increased by 
(1) eliminating extraneous items from the worship service on this high day, 
(2) avoiding delays before and after foot-washing, and (3) having the 
deaconesses arrange the emblems on the communion table well beforehand.
Preliminaries—The introductory portion of the service should be brief, 
including only short announcements, a hymn, prayer, offering, and a short 
sermon before separating for the foot-washing and returning for the Lord’s 
Supper.
Foot-Washing—Each church should have a plan for meeting the needs 
of its members for the foot-washing service. (See Notes, #5, p. 188.)
Bread and Wine—Following the foot-washing, the congregation comes 
together once again to partake of the bread and the wine. (See Notes, #6, 
pp. 188-189.)
Celebration—Communion should always be a solemn, never somber, 
experience. Wrongs have been righted, sins have been forgiven, and faith has 
been reaffirmed. It is a time for celebration. Let the music be bright and 
joyous. The service should end on a high note, such as with a musical feature 
or congregational singing, followed by dismissal.
An offering for the poor is often taken as the congregation leaves.
After the service the deacons and deaconesses clear the table, collect the 
utensils, and respectfully dispose of any remaining emblems. In no case 
should these emblems be consumed or returned to common use.
Who May Participate—The Church practices open communion. All 
who have committed their lives to the Savior may participate. Children learn 
the significance of the service by observing others participating. After 
receiving formal instruction in baptismal classes and making their 
commitment to Jesus in baptism, they are thereby prepared to partake in the 
service themselves.
“Christ’s example forbids exclusiveness at the Lord’s Supper. It is true 
that open sin excludes the guilty. This the Holy Spirit plainly teaches. 1 Cor. 
5:11. But beyond this none are to pass judgment. God has not left it with men 
to say who shall present themselves on these occasions. For who can read the 
heart? Who can distinguish the tares from the wheat? ‘Let a man examine 
himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.’ For
‘whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, 
shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.’ ‘He that eateth and drinketh 
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the 
Lord’s body.’ 1 Cor. 11:28, 27, 29. . . . There may come into the company 
persons who are not in heart servants of truth and holiness, but who may wish 
to take part in the service. They should not be forbidden. There are witnesses 
present who were present when Jesus washed the feet of the disciples and of 
Judas. More than human eyes beheld the scene.”—DA 656.
Every Member Should Attend—“None should exclude themselves 
from the Communion because some who are unworthy may be present. Every 
disciple is called upon to participate publicly, and thus bear witness that he 
accepts Christ as a personal Savior. It is at these, His own appointments, that 
Christ meets His people, and energizes them by His presence. Hearts and 
hands that are unworthy may even administer the ordinance, yet Christ is 
there to minister to His children. All who come with their faith fixed upon 
Him will be greatly blessed. All who neglect these seasons of divine privilege
will suffer loss. Of them it may appropriately be said, ‘Ye are not all clean.’ 
”—DA 656.
Who May Conduct the Communion Service—The communion 
service is to be conducted by an ordained/commissioned pastor or an 
ordained elder. Deacons or deaconesses are not permitted to conduct the 
service.
Communion for Those Who Cannot Attend—If members are ill or 
cannot for other reasons attend the communion service, the pastor or elder, 
possibly accompanied and assisted by a deacon or deaconess, may conduct a 
special service in their homes.

                <h2>Prayer Meeting</h2>
                <p>Prayer Meetings Should Be Interesting—“The prayer meetings 
should be the most interesting gatherings that are held, but these are
frequently poorly managed. Many attend preaching, but neglect the prayer 
meeting. Here, again, thought is required. Wisdom should be sought of God, 
and plans should be laid to conduct the meetings so that they will be 
interesting and attractive. The people hunger for the bread of life. If they find 
it at the prayer meeting they will go there to receive it.
“Long, prosy talks and prayers are out of place anywhere, and especially 
in the social [prayer] meeting. Those who are forward and ever ready to speak
are allowed to crowd out the testimony of the timid and retiring. Those who 
are most superficial generally have the most to say. Their prayers are long 
and mechanical. They weary the angels and the people who listen to them. 
Our prayers should be short and right to the point. Let the long, tiresome 
petitions be left for the closet, if any have such to offer. Let the Spirit of God 
into your hearts, and it will sweep away all dry formality.”—4T 70, 71.
More than ordinary efforts should be made to assure the success of the 
prayer meeting. The meeting should begin on time, even if only two or three 
persons are present. There should be a short, 15- to 20-minute Scripture study
or presentation from the Spirit of Prophecy, followed by prayer, testimonies, 
and a benediction.
Vary the plan of the service from week to week.
If members are unable to assemble at the usual place for prayer meeting, 
home meetings may be of great benefit.

                <p>The local church operates within defined roles in Seventh-day Adventist 
Church structure. Within the context of those roles, the business meeting is
the constituency meeting of the local church. (See pp. 28-29.) Members in 
regular standing are encouraged to attend and are entitled to vote. A member 
under censure has no right to participate by voice or vote.
            
Business meetings shall be held at least once a year. The pastor, or the 
board in consultation with and support of the pastor, calls the meeting. 
Business meetings should be announced a week or two in advance at the 
regular Sabbath worship service, with detail as to time and place. The pastor, 
an elder chosen by the pastor, or, in some cases, the conference president, or 
his designee, serves as chairperson of the business meeting.
            
Each church decides what the quorum will be for future meetings.
Votes by proxy or letter are not permitted.
            
Major items should be decided at a regular or specially called business 
meeting.
            
The business meeting has authority over the board and may delegate 
responsibilities to the board in addition to those already assigned by the 
Church Manual. (See pp. 134-138.)
            
The business meeting agenda should include reports about the work of 
the church. At least once a year the agenda should include reports covering 
church activities. Based on those reports, a proposed plan of action for the 
next year, including an annual budget, should be presented for approval. 
When possible, reports and plans for the next year should be presented in 
writing. (See Notes, #7, pp. 189-190.)
            
In order to maintain a spirit of cooperation between the church and 
conference, the church shall secure counsel from conference officers on all 
major matters.
            
Conference and union officers (president, secretary, treasurer) or their 
designee may attend without vote (unless granted by the church) any business 
meeting of any church in their territory. An action to allow voting is not 
required if the officer is currently a member of that congregation.

                <h2>Church Board and Its Meetings</h2>
                <p>Definition and Function—Every church must have a functioning 
board whose members have been elected during a church business meeting. 
Its chief concern is having an active discipleship plan in place, which includes 
both the spiritual nurture of the church and the work of planning and fostering
evangelism.
Included in church board responsibilities are:
1. An active discipleship plan.
2. Evangelism in all of its phases.
3. Spiritual nurturing and mentoring of members.
4. Maintenance of doctrinal purity.
5. Upholding of Christian standards.
6. Recommending changes in church membership.
7. Oversight of church finances.
8. Protection and care of church properties.
9. Coordination of church departments.
The gospel commission of Jesus tells us that making disciples, which 
includes baptizing and teaching, is the primary function of the church 
(Matt. 28:18-20). It is, therefore, also the primary function of the board, 
which serves as the chief committee of the church. When the board devotes 
its first interests and highest energies to involving every member in 
proclaiming the good news and making disciples, most problems are 
alleviated or prevented, and a strong, positive influence is felt in the spiritual 
life and growth of members.
Spiritual Nurture—Christ’s love for the Church needs to be 
manifested within the Church by His followers. True discipleship entails not 
only Biblical teaching (Matt. 28:20), but also a passionate commitment to 
loving our fellow believers unconditionally. This was the heart of Christ’s 
message to His disciples as He faced the cross (John 15:9-13). Christ’s 
command to them applies to us: that we “love one another.” Ellen G. White’s 
powerful insight into this historical scene is still vital for us: “This love is the 
evidence of their discipleship.”—DA 677, 678.
Therefore, it is one of the primary functions of the board to ensure that 
members are nurtured and mentored in a personal, dynamic relationship with 
Jesus Christ. 
Making Disciples—The mission of the Church is to make disciples of 
Jesus Christ, who live as His loving witnesses and proclaim to all people the 
everlasting gospel of the Three Angels’ Messages in preparation for His soon 
return (Matt. 28:18-20, Acts 1:8, Rev. 14:6-12). The purpose of the Church 
as the body of Christ is to intentionally make disciples so that they continue 
in an active and fruitful relationship with Christ and His Church.
Disciple-making is based on an ongoing, lifelong relationship with Jesus. 
The believer commits to “abiding in Christ” (John 15:8), to being trained for 
fruitful discipleship by sharing Jesus with others, as well as to leading other 
members to also be faithful disciples.
The Church, individually and collectively, shares responsibility for 
ensuring that every church member remains part of the body of Christ.
Membership—The board is elected by the members at the time of the 
regular election officers. (See pp. 76-77.) In addition to conference-appointed 
pastors, the church should elect a representative board that includes the 
following officers:
Elders
Head deacon 
Head deaconess 
Treasurer
Clerk
Interest coordinator 
Adventist Community Services leader or Dorcas Society leader 
Adventist Men’s coordinator 
Adventist Possibility Ministries leader
Adventist Youth Ministries
Adventurer Club director
Ambassador Club leader
Pathfinder Club director
Public Campus Ministries leader/coordinator
Young Adults leader
Bible school coordinator 
Children’s ministries leader 
Church music coordinator
Communication committee chairperson or communication secretary
Education secretary/church school principal or head teacher
Family ministries leader 
Health ministries leader
Home and School Association leader
Personal ministries leader and secretary 
Publishing ministries coordinator 
Religious liberty leader
Sabbath School superintendent 
Stewardship ministries leader 
Women’s ministries leader
In some cases, depending on the size of the membership, the board may 
not include all of this list or may add additional members. The pastor 
appointed by the conference to serve the church always is a member of the 
board.
Officers—The chairperson of the board is the conference-appointed
pastor. If the pastor prefers not to act in this capacity or is unable to be 
present, he/she may arrange for an elder to preside as chairperson.
The clerk serves as secretary of the board and is responsible for 
recording, presenting, and preserving the minutes of the meetings.
Meetings—Because the work of the board is vital to the life, health, and 
growth of the church, it is recommended that it meet at least once each month, 
more frequently if needed. It is well to fix the monthly meeting time for the 
same week and the same day each month.
The board meeting is announced at the regular Sabbath worship service, 
and all board members are urged to attend.
Each church should determine at a business meeting the number of board 
members who must be present to constitute a quorum at future meetings.
Where allowed by local law, board members may participate in meetings by 
means of an electronic conference or similar communication by which all 
persons participating can communicate with each other at the same time, and 
participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at such a 
meeting.
Votes by proxy or letter are not permitted.
Work of the Board—The board is responsible to: 1. Ensure that there 
is an active, ongoing discipleship plan in place, which includes both spiritual 
nurture and outreach ministries. This is the most important item for the 
board’s attention.
2. Study membership lists and initiate plans for reconnecting 
(reclaiming) members who have separated from the church.
3. Train local church leadership in how to encourage intentional 
spiritual growth in themselves and others.
4. Evangelize the outreach (missionary) territory of the church. Once
each quarter an entire meeting should be devoted to plans for evangelism. 
The board will study conference recommendations for evangelistic programs
and methods and how they can be implemented locally. The pastor and the 
board will initiate and develop plans for public evangelistic meetings.
5. Coordinate outreach programs for all church departments, although 
each department develops its plans for outreach within its own sphere. To 
avoid conflict in timing, competition in securing volunteers, and to achieve 
maximum beneficial results, coordination is essential. Before completing and 
announcing plans for any program, each department should submit its plans 
to the board for approval. The departments also report to the board on the 
progress and results of their outreach programs. The board may suggest how 
departmental programs can contribute to the preparation, conduct, and 
follow-up of a public evangelistic campaign.
6. Encourage the personal ministries department to enlist all members 
and children in some form of personal outreach (missionary) service. 
Training classes should be conducted in various lines of outreach ministry.
7. Encourage the interest coordinator to ensure that every interest is 
personally and promptly followed up by assigned laypersons. 
8. Encourage each department to report at least quarterly to the board 
and to members at business meetings or in Sabbath meetings in regards to 
spiritual nurture and evangelism. 
9. Receive regular reports. The board should consider details of church 
business and receive regular reports of the treasurer on the church’s finances. 
The board should study the membership record and inquire into the spiritual 
standing of all members and provide for visits to sick, discouraged, or 
backslidden members. Other officers should periodically report.
10. Promote Adventist education.
Committees of the Board—The board should permit no other business 
to interfere with planning for evangelism. Should other business be too timeconsuming, the board should appoint committees to care for specific areas of 
church business, such as finance or church building projects. Such 
committees will then make recommendations to the board. (See Notes, #8, p. 
190.)

                <h2>Finance Committee</h2>
                <p>Each church should have a mission-driven, broadly-based 
consultative financial planning and budgeting process with a committee 
structure that can give detailed review to the ongoing financial planning and 
budgeting. In some cases, this may take the form of a finance committee. In 
other cases, in smaller churches, this process may be handled directly by the 
church board. If the church establishes a separate committee for this purpose, 
the responsibilities should include reviewing budget requests and the review 
of the annual operating budget as well as a review of the financial position of 
the church as reflected in the financial statements. The approval of the budget 
and the review of the financial statement shall then be recommended to the 
church board and onward to the business meeting of the church for action.

                <h2>School Board Meetings</h2>
                <p>The church school is usually supervised by a church school board. The 
church elects a chairperson to preside over meetings and a secretary to keep 
records of meetings and actions. This board should meet at regular times. 
Special meetings may be called by the chairperson. Some churches prefer to 
have the church board, or a subcommittee of the church board, also serve as 
the school board. (See also pp. 97-98.)

                <p>The Home and School Association should meet monthly and coordinate 
the activities of home, school, and church. Attention should be given to the 
education of parents, as well as to assisting the school to obtain needed 
resources, such as room parents, books, teaching materials, and equipment. 
Materials to assist Home and School leaders are available through the 
conference education department. (See also pp. 96-97.)

                <h2>Youth Meetings</h2>
                <p>Leaders of the church’s various youth groups should schedule regular 
meetings that involve the church’s young people in meaningful activities that 
will tie them closer to the church and train them for useful service. (See also 
pp. 110-115.)
            
Senior Youth Ministries Meetings (Ambassadors and Young 
Adults)—Senior Youth Ministries meetings should convene on a regular 
schedule and focus on developing the spiritual, mental, emotional, and 
physical characteristics of the church’s youth. Meetings also provide 
Christian social interaction and witnessing programs supporting the soulwinning plans of the church. For resources, see Notes #9, p. 190.

            Public Campus Ministries Meetings—Where the church has 
appointed a Public Campus Ministries director/coordinator, meetings should 
be organized to care for the special needs of public college/university 
students in consultation with and support of the Adventist Youth Ministries 
Committee.
            
Junior Youth Ministries Meetings (Adventurers and 
Pathfinders)—Junior Youth Ministries meetings are similar in purpose to 
Senior Youth Ministries, but involve junior youth. Adventurer Club meetings 
provide specialized programs for primary/early school-age children designed 
to complement and strengthen parental involvement in early childhood 
development, while Pathfinder Club meetings provide specialized indoor and 
outdoor activities for the holistic development of children from 10 to 15 years 
old. Meetings and other activities are to be carried out according to 
conference policies as outlined in the club manuals and in coordination with 
other youth-related and family-related organizations of the church.
