                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Ambassadors is a new level of youth ministry designed to equip leaders with resources to train a new generation of youths to be the hands, feet, and voice of Jesus in their local churches and communities.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">An ambassador generally represents a country or a cause. A Christian ambassador is a representative of another kind; they represent the values, principles, culture, and laws of the kingdom of God. They stand for the character and purpose of the King of this kingdom— Jesus Christ, Himself.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">This Youth Department resource is based on seven foundations that are considered as essential to meet the developmental needs of our young people between the ages of 16-21. They include:</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">A Christ-centered discipleship plan</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Leadership development</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">A personal, public, and small group based mission lifestyle</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Character and personality development, including outdoor, high adventure programming</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Lifestyle and vocational training</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Nurturing godly relationships</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Community outreach development through service projects and emergency preparedness training</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Each of these seven foundations will be presented in modules, with participants gaining certification for each module completed. While each module has a specific focus, there are FOUR elements that will be common throughout the curriculum. Leaders MUST ensure that all these elements are embraced to make the experience meaningful, attractive, and challenging.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">First, the concept of a spiritual companion. At the beginning of each module, each participant will choose a friend who will be their companion for the duration of the module. They will meet during each session to encourage and support each other in their role and growth as an Ambassador. Groups of spiritual companions will also come together for specific activities. This builds the concept of interdependence and accountability into the Ambassador experience.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Second, an Individual Discipleship Plan (IDP). At the beginning of every module, each participant will make a simple plan of how they would like to grow spiritually and acquire practical competency in the area of the upcoming module. Their spiritual companion will be there throughout the module to help and encourage them to accomplish their plan. The IDP helps to emphasize the continuing nature of discipleship and that learning is a continual part of life. By linking spiritual companions together for this work, it stresses the need for interdependence on each other as we learn, grow, and work for God. (See guidelines for creating the IDP on page 11. Participants have their IDP pages in their Guidebook.)</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Third, projects. Each module will have a project that will integrate the core concepts from the module into a service learning activity focused on helping others. This will be an opportunity for the Ambassador class to work together as a whole. You will </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">find INSTRUCTIONS for setting up your project in the back pages of this Leader’s Guide. You might have to plan for multiple projects, depending on the size of your group.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">The main objective is to incorporate service as a way of life, rather than an occasional activity.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Aim for projects that would call for regular involvement over a period of time.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Make contact with your Volunteer Service organizations, the local Council, and other entities that could assist you.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">If your group settles on a particular medium/long term project, there is no need to change the project when the time comes to engage with a new module. Use your discretion.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Fourth, social activities. Ensure that you plan for a social activity at least once a month. Make sure that you always provide opportunities for good and wholesome fun for that age group. </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">You do not have to conduct all your sessions in a building. As appropriate, conduct some in nature, in the context of a camp, in someone’s home, etc.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">In the back pages of your Leader’s Guide you will find a list of websites where you can access ‘Ice Breakers’ or brief fun activities that you can inject into all your sessions. </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Of course, CONDUCT ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES PRAYERFULLY.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">It is highly recommended that you set aside your first meeting as a fun ORIENTATION to share the Ambassadors concept, share the Participant’s Guides, give an overview of the first module, discuss the FOUR elements and their implementation, discuss the frequency of meetings, organize calendars, etc.<br>

A participant’s guide for each module has been prepared for each participant. </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">The Participant’s Guide is essentially the workbook containing all the sessions of each module that the participant will engage with.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">In the back pages of each module there is a page for creating the IDP. There is also a list of the sessions for that module that the leader will date and sign upon the participant’s completion.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Each participant will be required to complete 75 percent attendance and participation to receive the certification or award at the end of each module. Participants can make-up for missed lessons to achieve the required 75 percent at the discretion of their leader. Fostering togetherness is at the heart of a model for discipleship, which the General Conference is focusing on; it is known as “Together </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Growing Fruitful Disciples.” This model emphasizes understanding, connecting, equipping, and ministering—but doing all of this “together.” For God did not design us to grow or minister alone, but in community. Paul writes that growing in Christ is achieved as everyone uses the gifts God has given to them, “until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13).</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>

As a human being with a nature that naturally tends to move away from God, growing to reflect Jesus as an Ambassador will rarely happen by chance or without much thought. That’s why for each of the Ambassador’s modules, you will be creating your own IDP. The focus of each IDP will relate to the theme of your current module and last for the duration of that module.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Here is an example of what an IDP will look like. Fill in your own IDP on the form provided.<br>

At the beginning of e</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ch module in the curriculum, participants will develop an individual discipleship plan (IDP) that will guide their personal spiritual journey during that section. Each IDP will focus on the theme of that section. “Next Steps” is a time for participants to reflect on how their IDP is working and to pray for each other in what they aim to do next. This will be done with their spiritual companion. A spiritual companion is a friend who prays for and encourages their own companion over a set period of time.<br>

The Bible is God’s book to</span><span style="color:#000000;"> sh</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>ow His Ambassado</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">rs </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">how to live on earth while representing His kingdom in heaven. It explains who God is, who we are, and where we are going. At the heart of this book is the revelation of Jesus, and that only through His Holy Spirit can His Ambassadors make an eternal impact in the world. Before sin, we would have known how to live without having it written down because God’s laws and principles would have been written on our hearts and minds. But while we live with very forgetful memories, God has chosen to write everything down for us.<br>
As Ambassadors we use words to encourage people</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">to turn to Jesus. But who we are—our characters—demonstrate the truth and power of our words. In other words, who we are makes our words believable. In Ezekiel 36:23-26, God promises to reveal His holiness to the nations “through” His people. In these verses, what is the most important thing that will enable you to reveal to others the truth about God?<br>

 he refreshes my soul.<br>

Read the “did you kno</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>w?” section. Psa</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">lms</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> 23 and 27 help us to understand the journey Ambassadors are on and why they take it. As this journey to the Shepherd’s house is not always easy, here are six encouragements as to why Ambassadors should keep going.<br>
No matter how unprepared and weak we mi</span><span style="color:#000000;">g</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ht feel on our journey, the Shepherd promises to provide everything we need: “The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not be in want” (23:1).<br>
No matter how bewildering or confusing </span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ur journey might be, walking in the Shepherd’s paths will always accomplish the Shepherd’s purposes for our lives, “He guides me in paths of righteousness for His name’s sake” (Verse 3). Notice how these paths are all called “paths of righteousness” (NIV) or “right paths” (NRSV). But why are they called right or righteous paths? First, they are right paths because they lead to the right place, the Shepherd’s home. Second, they are right paths because they keep us on a journey in the company of the right person, the Shepherd. Third, they are right paths because they shape us into the right people. Notice how we travel the paths of righteousness “for His name’s sake” (23:3). “For His name’s sake” means for the honor and glory of the Shepherd.<br>
No matter how frightening our journey m</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ght be, the darkness is not a place to be feared, for it is a place the Shepherd uses to mature us—whether we have gone there on our own, or whether He has led us there: “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me” (23:4). It is in the darkness, like no other place, that we see God deliver us from attack with the rod and rescue us with His staff.<br>
No matter how easy we expect our journe</span><span style="color:#000000;">y</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> to be, the Shepherd may allow our enemies to surround us in order for us to gain a deeper understanding of His love for us: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows” (23:5). We may be tempted to think that our enemies will steal God’s blessings for us, but they cannot. No one can take what God gives to us.<br>
No matter how lonely our journey may ap</span><span style="color:#000000;">p</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ear to be, the Shepherd is always present. “Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life” (23:6).<br>
The end of the journey enables the Psal</span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ist to “dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” The journey of Psalm 23 finishes at the house of the Lord, but the Psalmist does not explain why he is going there—but in Psalm 27 he does. The “one thing” he wants in His life is to “gaze upon the beauty of the Lord” (27:4). The beauty of Christ, the perfection of His character, is something that motivates the Psalmist’s whole being when the valley is dark and enemies surround him. Nothing is more precious to the Psalmist than the beauty of Jesus. Most importantly, it is as he gazes upon Jesus that he is changed to become like Him.<br>

Welcome a</strong>nd opening</span><span style="color:#000000;"> prayer (2 min).<br>
Explain what participants can expect to learn in this lesson (2 min).<br>
On sheets of A4 or larger, ask everyone in the group to draw a picture of something they value highly (2 min).<br>
Depending on the size of the group, ask participants to get into groups of two to four.<br>
In their small groups, ask each person to share what they drew and why it is so valuable to them (2 min).<br>
Ask for volunteers to share their pictures and explanations with the whole group.<br>
Ask for volunteers from the whole group to describe how it felt to share something that is valuable to them with other people.<br>
Comment on the reality that when we share things that are important to us, one of the consequences is that it can deepen the relationships between people.<br>
Complete the “mission briefing” handout for participants to discuss in groups of two or three (10 min).<br>
Leaders should move around the room to listen to conversations to ensure participants are going in the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
Before moving on, summarize the question and answers in this section and ask for any final comments or questions (5 min).<br>
Once finished, participants can move immediately into the next section, “thinking it through.”<br>
Give participants five minutes to write down their own answers by themselves.<br>
Next, ask participants to share their reflections with the others they studied with in the “mission briefing” section.<br>
Ask the group to divide into groups of two.<br>
Ask them to describe a time when someone betrayed their confidence. What happened to their friendship as a result? (2 min each)<br>
Explain that betraying a confidence can be very painful and break relationships. On the other hand, a trustworthy relationship can be encouraging to others (1 min).<br>

R</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>ead Ephesians 4:</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">11-</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">13. Why do you think Paul places “attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” in the context of the community working together? Why don’t we become like Jesus on our own?<br>
___________________</span><span style="color:#000000;">_</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
___________________</span><span style="color:#000000;">_</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
___________________</span><span style="color:#000000;">_</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
In Paul’s mind, exp</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">riencing the fullness of Christ was not a private matter, but was designed to happen best in the context of the church community—a community where the gifts of the Holy Spirit were being used. Paul teaches that as a church we are the body of Jesus. We are all different, but we are united together and, most importantly, united with the Head, Jesus.<br>
Jesus suggests that</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">something special happens when we are united. Read John 17:20-23. What does Jesus identify as the purpose of unity for: a ) Christians? _________________________________________________________________________________<br>
b) The world? _____</span><span style="color:#000000;">_</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">___________________________________________________________________________<br>
Growing together is</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">important for two further reasons. The first is our deep sinfulness. Ever since Adam and Eve sinned, each of us is born into the world with a natural tendency to live in opposition to God and the ways of His kingdom. As David laments, “Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me” (Psalm 51:5). So by the time we begin to choose to follow Christ, we already have many sinful habits that are deeply ingrained within us and are difficult to undo all at once. The second challenge is our supernatural enemy. As Paul clearly identifies, “our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” (Ephesians 6:12). We cannot survive against such a supernatural enemy with human power. We are continually in need of supernatural power from outside of ourselves that only God provides. And when we work together, we can encourage each other so that we don’t become discouraged. 52&nbsp;&nbsp; 1: I am an amba</span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ssad</strong>or for another world<br>

Solomon gives some </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">h</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">elpful and practical counsel:<br>
“Two people are bet</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">er off than one, for they can help each other succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble” (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10).<br>
While having suppor</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> from others is important in all areas of life, it is particularly important in our spiritual lives. This is why God created us to live as Christians in the community of the church, so that we will be continually surrounded by others to encourage and support us. This encouragement and support is also why Jesus sent the disciples out to minister two by two.<br>
Each time you creat</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> an individual discipleship plan (IDP), you will choose someone to share your spiritual journey with for the duration of the module. Spend a moment praying for God’s guidance, then consider the following questions:<br>
Who might God want </span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">e to spiritually encourage and support?<br>
Who might God want </span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">o be a spiritual encouragement and support to me?<br>
Who do I feel comfo</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">table with? Who will keep my trust?<br>
What do Spiritual C</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>mpanions do each week?—Next Steps<br>
From now on, every </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">l</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">esson will have a time for Spiritual Companions to come together to discuss where each one is in working through their IDP. Each time you come together, you will ask each other three simple questions:<br>
How is your spiritu</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">l life going?<br>
How are things goin</span><span style="color:#000000;">g</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> with your IDP?<br>

Welcome a</strong>nd opening</span><span style="color:#000000;"> prayer (2 min).<br>
Explain what participants can expect to learn in this lesson (2 min).<br>
Ask the group: Who do you know who is worthy of being honored for something? Why should they be honored, and how would you do it?<br>
Read the “did you know?” section together.<br>
Briefly ask people what they think of the idea that the call to come out of Babylon is a call to come into something—into a community dedicated to restoring broken people back into the image of God.<br>
Complete the “mission briefing” handout for participants to discuss in groups of two or three (10 min).<br>
Leaders should move around the room to listen to conversations to ensure participants are going in the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
Before moving on, summarize the question and answers in this section and ask for any final comments or questions (5 min).<br>
Once finished, participants can move immediately into the next section, “thinking it through.”<br>
Give participants five minutes to write down their own answers by themselves.<br>
Next, ask participants to share their reflections with the others they studied with in the “mission briefing” section.<br>
Explain to the participants what is in the short introduction for this section in the handout.<br>
Next, ask participants to read through the seven parts of “reflecting Jesus in the great controversy.”<br>
Ask everyone to put the handout out of sight and get into groups of two.<br>
Before class, on seven small pieces of paper, write the following titles—one on each piece: fall of satan, creation, the fall, salvation, judgement, second coming, re-creation of the world. Prepare as many sets of these papers as you will have small groups.<br>
Roleplay: Ask each person in the group to arrange the papers in their chronological order as given in the handout. Ask each one to explain to the other how each event relates to the theme of reflecting Jesus.<br>
Continue with this exercise until participants feel comfortable that they know these seven events and what they mean. Be aware that there may be many questions arising throughout this exercise.<br>

So far, we have loo</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">k</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ed at honoring in two ways. First, we honor Jesus as we prepare the world to meet Him, calling people to come out of spiritual Babylon and into communities devoted to rebuilding His image in broken human hearts. Second, like Paul, we honor Jesus on a personal level as we reveal Jesus within our own lives and make the restoration of the image of Jesus the purpose of our own ministry.<br>
Now, let’s look at </span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">his from a cosmic perspective.<br>
The Bible is a stor</span><span style="color:#000000;">y</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">. If you look at the handout, “Reflecting Jesus in the Great Controversy,” you will see seven main events in this story— like scenes in a play. Each of these seven scenes brings new information, and each scene is important to understand the play as a whole. We could say that every part of the Bible relates to one or more of these seven events in some way.<br>
Notice that the sto</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">y is wrapped inside a cosmic supernatural battle. This is the environment in which the Ambassador lives. Our world, and our work, is like a theatre in the cosmos, with heaven and untold numbers of other worlds watching.<br>
The Lord Jesus is m</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">king experiments on human hearts through the exhibition of <br>
His mercy and abund</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">nt grace. He is effecting transformations so amazing that <br>
Satan, with all His</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">triumphant boasting, with all His confederacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government, stands viewing them as a fortress <br>
impregnable to His </span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ophistries and delusions. They are to him an incomprehensible <br>
mystery. The angels</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">of God, seraphim and cherubim, the powers commissioned to cooperate with human agencies, look on with astonishment and joy, that <br>
fallen men, once ch</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ldren of wrath, are through the training of Christ developing <br>
characters after th</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> divine similitude, to be sons and daughters of God, to act an important part in the occupations and pleasures of heaven.<br>

Reflecting Jesus in</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> the Great Controversy<br>
Fall of Satan and hi<strong>s angels from heaven<br>
Satan wanted to be l</strong>ike God. Because of His pride, Satan started a war in heaven against Jesus and the kingdom of heaven. As a result, Satan and one third of the angels were expelled from heaven. Satan’s pride and anger increased as he later began trying to destroy the people Jesus made in His own image. As a fallen angel, Satan and his angels work invisibly to human eyes. Isaiah 14:12-15; Eze<strong>kiel 28:14-17; Revelation 12:7-9; Ephesians 6:10-12.<br>
Creation—in God’s p</strong>e<strong>rfect image<br>
Jesus created us in </strong>His image— His character. Everything He made was beautiful and caused great joy for Him and all in the universe. Genesis 1:26-27; Gen<strong>esis 1:31; Job 38:4-7; Colossians 1:15-17.<br>
The Fall—God’s imag</strong>e<strong> de-formed<br>
Soon after creation,</strong> Eve went to the tree of good and evil—the very place God told her not to go. It was there that Satan was able to tempt her. Once she and Adam disobeyed God, they suddenly realized that they were without clothes. This sin had broken God’s character within them. It appears that bright glory had clothed them, representing God’s glorious character within them. So now that Christ’s character in them was broken, the glory around them vanished. But more than that, they were beginning to experience the consequences of their disobedience—they were beginning to die.<br>
How could they, and all their children who would follow, be rescued from the consequences of their sin? Genesis 3:1-12.<br>
Salv<strong>ation—Re-format</strong>i<strong>on of God’s image<br>
Sin always leads to </strong>death. As sinners we are condemned to die eternally, but Jesus came and died in our place. He took the punishment for sin that we should have taken. So when I trust that Jesus has died for me, God considers that I am saved from the consequence of my sin in the future—eternal death. But He also saves from sin in the present. As I put my faith in the re-creative work of Jesus through the Holy Spirit, Jesus restores His own character back into me—the character that became de-formed in Adam and Eve in Eden. When the Holy Spirit continues to work in us, we begin to reflect Jesus in increasing ways. Isaiah 53:4-6; Roman<strong>s 3:21-24; 6:23; Romans 8:29; Galatians 4:19; 2 Corinthians 3:18.<br>
Pre-Advent Judgemen</strong>t<strong><br>
Satan has always acc</strong>used God of being unfair and unjust. So before Jesus returns, God holds a judgement that records how His decisions about our future are actually based on our own choices—for or against Him. This is an open judgement, where the whole universe will ultimately be able to see that God has been right, good, and fair. We are saved by our faith—our resting trust—in Jesus. Such a faith always <br>
66&nbsp; 1: I am an amba<strong>ssad</strong>or for another world<br>
results in good works. So the type of people we become and the sorts of things we do are the evidence that Jesus looks at to see if our faith is genuine. Romans 14:10-12; Dan<strong>iel 7:9-10; Matthew 25:31-46; Galatians 5:22-23; Revelation 20.<br>
Second Coming<br>
Jesus</strong> <strong>promised He wo</strong>uld return and will do so physically—just as when He came the first time. This will not be a secret, but a visible, cosmic event for all to see. At this time, in “the twinkling of an eye,” those who died in Christ will be resurrected. With the faithful who are alive we will be reunited and all be clothed with the same glory that Adam and Eve wore in Eden. John 14:1-3; Acts 1:<strong>9-10; Matthew 24:2427; 1 Corinthians 15:35-55.<br>
Destruction of evil</strong> <strong>and eternal re-creation<br>
After 1000 years wit</strong>h Jesus in heaven, we will judge Satan, His angels, and the wicked. After this judgement has been announced, God will destroy the world by fire and recreate it as He intended at the beginning. We will then live on the earth, growing more and more in the character of Jesus for the rest of eternity.<br>

Welcome a</strong>nd opening</span><span style="color:#000000;"> prayer (2 min).<br>
Explain what participants can expect to learn in this lesson (2 min).<br>
Ask for volunteers to share a time when they refused to listen to another person. Why did they choose not to listen, and what were the consequences of that? (3 min)<br>
Explain that many times, if we refuse to listen, we can suffer all sorts of problems.<br>
Read / explain “did you know?”<br>
Check that everyone understands the basic process of spiritual growth shown in the diagram, and that the starting point for us is openness (8 min).<br>
Complete the “mission briefing” handout for participants to discuss in groups of two or three (10 min). <br>
There is a lot in this section so participants will need to work quickly.<br>
2.Leaders should move around the room to listen to conversations to ensure participants are going in the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
3.Before moving on, summarize the question and answers in this section and ask for any final comments or questions (5 min).<br>
4.Once finished, participants can move immediately into the next section, “thinking it through.”<br>
Give participants five minutes to write down their own answers by themselves.<br>
Next, ask participants to share their reflections with the others they studied with in the “mission briefing” section.<br>
Ask the participants to get into groups of three or four.<br>
Provide each group an A4 size piece of paper and a pen.<br>
Tell each group they have one minute to list as many ways as they can think of that cause people to become closed to the voice of the Holy Spirit.<br>
When the time is up, ask each group to report back. Create a combined list at the front for everyone to see.<br>
When the list is complete, ask the group for their observations.<br>
                                       <br>
72&nbsp; 1: I am an amba<strong>ssad</strong>or for another world<br>
Ask them if they think it is easier or harder for Christians to be closed to the Holy Spirit or non-Christians.<br>
Ask them if the combined list on the board relates more to Christians or non- Christians.<br>
With the whole group, go through part 1 of this section in the handout “Becoming aware of being closed.”<br>
Ask them to compare and contrast the list the group created earlier to this list. 10. Summarize this section by noting there are many ways we can be closed to God.<br>
Discuss how non-Christians might become open to the gospel if they are currently closed (5 min).<br>
Finally, ask participants to write an individual prayer of reflection in the second part of this section. There are two parts of this prayer. First, a prayer to ask God to reveal how they may be closed. Second, as they think about how they are closed to God, to write a prayer of response (5 min).<br>
next steps1. Have </span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>the Spiritu</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">al Companions discuss the following questions with each other and pray:<br>

How is your spiritual life going and your IDP?<br>
How can I pray for you—for your spiritual life and your IDP?<br>
2. Remind everyone to keep bringing their IDPs to class each week.<br>

This diagram helps u</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">s to understand the ways God <br>
works in our lives.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">This is important to remember <br>
because ambassadors</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">serve primarily out of who they <br>
are, not just what </span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">hey say.<br>
The arrows relate t</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> what God does. He initiates <br>
communication with </span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">e, He gives me understanding, <br>
He brings assurance</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">that I am His child, He baptizes me <br>
with His Holy Spiri</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">, and He draws me continually into <br>
deeper relationship</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">with the Trinity.<br>
The four outer circ</span><span style="color:#000000;">l</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">es relate to what I do in response <br>
to God’s work. If I</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">am open to God’s revelation, He will <br>
give me understandi</span><span style="color:#000000;">n</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">g. If I place my faith in what he <br>
shows me, He will b</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ing assurance. If I am willing to <br>
sacrifice everythin</span><span style="color:#000000;">g</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> for Him and empty myself like <br>
this, He will fill </span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">e with His Holy Spirit. If I devote <br>
myself to ministry,</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">God will bring me deeper into His <br>
presence.<br>
So there </span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">re four t</span><span style="color:#000000;">h</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ings that are important for me to <br>

mission briefing<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
A</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">t the beginning </span><span style="color:#000000;">of </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">the New Testament, Matthew quotes the prophet Isaiah to explain that the Saviour would be called “Emmanuel—which means ‘God with us’” (Matthew 1:23). The Bible makes it clear that we are not left alone on earth, but God had to take the initiative to come to us because “no one seeks God” (Romans 3:11). God took the initiative, first in Eden (Genesis 3:8-9), and later when He designed the tabernacle, saying, “Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8).<br>
Now imagine it is t</span><span style="color:#000000;">h</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">e time for the morning offerings at the tabernacle. As an Israelite, you call your family together and stand at the entrance of your tent, facing the sanctuary where the offerings will be made. They are made by the priests on behalf of the whole of Israel, symbolizing the consecration of your family and the rest of Israel to God. But wait. You don’t have to go to the front of your tent. You can ignore everything and keep eating your breakfast. So what is the difference between the person who recognizes his/her need to consecrate himself/herself to God, and the one who doesn’t care?<br>
What do the followi</span><span style="color:#000000;">n</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">g Bible verses teach about the meaning of a hard heart? Exodus 7:13, 22; 8:15, 19; 9:12; Mark 6:52; 8:17.<br>

2. The opposite of </span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> hard heart is a soft “heart of flesh.” What does the Bible teach about the characteristics of a heart of flesh in Ezekiel 11:19; 36:26?<br>

A person with a har</span><span style="color:#000000;">d</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> heart is closed to God, while the one with a heart of flesh is open to the impressions of the Holy Spirit. God may be speaking, but unless someone is actually open to listening, God’s voice will not be heard or understood. An Ambassador’s heart will begin to be re-formed to reflect Christ to others as we learn to be increasingly open to God and respond to what He longs to share with us.<br>

Explain what participants can expect to learn in this lesson (2 min).<br>
Read through the quotations from “did you know?” with the whole group. <br>
Ask volunteers to share which is their favorite quote and why.<br>
Discuss with the group, “In what sense do these quotations represent a biblical perspective on faith?”<br>
Explain that in “mission briefing,” we will now look more closely at biblical faith and why it is so important for Christian maturity.<br>
Complete the “mission briefing” handout for participants to discuss in groups of two or three (10 min).<br>
Leaders should move around the room to listen to conversations to ensure participants are going in the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
Before moving on, summarize the question and answers in this section and ask for any final comments or questions (5 min).<br>
Once finished, participants can move immediately into the next section, “thinking it through.”<br>
Give participants five minutes to write down their own answers by themselves.<br>
Next, ask participants to share their reflections with the others they studied with in the “mission briefing” section.<br>
Go through this section with your participants.<br>
Take at least five minutes at the end for participants to get into small groups and share what they have been learning about trusting God’s promises.<br>
Have the Spiritual Companions discuss the following questions with each other and pray:<br>
What have you learned today that can help with your IDP and spiritual growth as an Ambassador?<br>
How is your spiritual life going and your IDP?<br>
How can I pray for you—for your spiritual life and your IDP?<br>
Remind everyone to keep bringing their IDPs to class each week.<br>

I</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>n the last study</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> on</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> openness, we saw how the Old Testament uses the symbols of a hard and soft heart. However, the Bible also describes the heart as being circumcised or uncircumcised. While the meanings overlap, the idea of a circumcised heart is slightly different and illustrates another important spiritual principle.<br>
1. Read Genesis 17</span><span style="color:#000000;">:</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">10-26 and Exodus 12:44, 48. What does the Bible teach about the meaning of circumcision?<br>

At the time of the </span><span style="color:#000000;">I</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">sraelites, circumcision indicated belief in God’s covenant and membership to God’s community. However, it was still possible to be physically circumcised, but not believe God’s words. This was dangerous for the people. It could be easy for them to think that just because they were circumcised, then they were loyal members of God’s family. However, God was not merely looking for an external sign, but an internal commitment of faith.<br>
As the Bible makes </span><span style="color:#000000;">c</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">lear, “without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him” (Hebrews 11:6). Later in the Gospels, Jesus makes it continually clear that miracles are only possible if faith is present. And just as faith in Jesus was required for physical healing, so faith is required for the miracle of a life reformed in the character of Jesus.<br>
2. Read Jesus’ com</span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ents on faith in Matthew 8:10; 9:2, 29-30; 15:28. What do you think enabled these people to take Jesus seriously while many others did not?<br>

reflecting Jesus </span><span style="color:#000000;">&amp; H</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>is kingdom<br>
Have you ever prayed</strong> to be different inside, but ended up staying just the same? If so, what can we do about this lack of power? Here’s a promise from God to you that can help:<br>
“His divine power h</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">s given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by His own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us His very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.” (2 Peter 1:3-4)<br>
Someone calculated </span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">hat there are 1260 promises in the Bible. And did you know that God’s promises are all ultimately focused on what Peter is describing—for us to reflect the character of Jesus and avoid being hurt by sin? For these promises to work, however, James tells us bluntly that when we come to God, we must believe that God will do what He has promised. “But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does” (James 1:6-8).<br>
But how can we ask </span><span style="color:#000000;">G</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">od and be confident that we are asking for the right things? We could ask God for a Ferrari sports car, but there is no power in that prayer! Why? Because nowhere in the Bible does God promise to give any of us a sports car! However, when we know what God does promise us, then we can pray with complete confidence that God will answer. There is power in such prayers.<br>
So when we pray acc</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">rding to God’s words, our faith grows, and this faith brings God’s power into our lives for change. As you may know, Jesus performed miracles in the gospel stories that brought change into people’s lives because of their faith in His words.<br>
So where can we fin</span><span style="color:#000000;">d</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> God’s promises that bring the promise of His power to us?<br>
First, there are pr</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">mises where God promises to do something or give us something. Look at some of these in the box below.<br>

Second, descriptions of God Himself are also promises. Paul tells us that it was God’s plan that we become like His Son: “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son...” (Romans 8:29). So when we read descriptions of Jesus, these can become promises for our prayers to become like Him. (This does not include descriptions of God that belong to God alone; for example, that He is all powerful, all knowing, or everywhere at the same time, etc.)<br>

I</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>n the last lesso</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">n, </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">we looked at faith. When we trust God, what does the Holy Spirit do in us (Ephesians 1:13 and Romans 8:16)?<br>
___________________</span><span style="color:#000000;">_</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
When we have the as</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">urance that we are God’s children, we will be willing to give God everything we have and are—because we know we are safe in His hands. However, doing this—sometimes called dying to self—is hard. This is because when sin entered the world it corrupted our human nature. Our challenge is not simply to stop doing wrong things (which we normally call sins), but to deal with a corrupted human nature that instinctively craves what is opposed to God.<br>
The tabernacle begi</span><span style="color:#000000;">n</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">s to explain how to address this problem. At the heart of the morning and evening services in the tabernacle were the sacrifices. At each service, a one-year-old male lamb was killed, symbolizing the death of Jesus who would die in the place of sinners. As this service took place twice a day, every day of the year, it symbolized that the consecration of God’s people was continually dependent on the sacrifice of Jesus.<br>
2.What does Jesus </span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ay we are to do if we are to be His disciples (Luke 9:23-24)?<br>
___________________</span><span style="color:#000000;">_</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
3.Paul explained H</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">s own practice when he wrote, “I die daily” (1 Corinthians 15:31). According to what Paul writes in Romans 12:1-2, what is the purpose of becoming a living sacrifice? Why is death necessary to achieve this purpose?<br>
___________________</span><span style="color:#000000;">_</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
The cross had only </span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ne purpose—death. Like the daily tabernacle sacrifices, Jesus’ call—that Paul obeyed—is nothing less than a daily call to give everything we have and are to Him. Without the continual putting to death of our sinful natures, the Holy Spirit will have difficulty revealing Christ in us. This is important, because without the ability to reveal Jesus, Ambassadors will not be able to witness.<br>

2.The disciples ha</span><span style="color:#000000;">d</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> given up their livelihoods and friends to follow Jesus. They probably imagined they had given up everything. But when Jesus discusses that He is going to die, they became angry (Mark 8:31-33). It appears that death was not part of their understanding of the call to discipleship. What parts of your life do you have difficulty giving up completely to God?<br>

dying to self in th</span><span style="color:#000000;">e writings of Ellen White<br>
                                       <br>
Death to self symb</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">o</span><span style="color:#000000;">l<strong>ized by Jesus before His ministry begins. Then Jesus came fro</strong>m Galilee to the Jordan to be baptised by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented (Matthew 3:13-15).<br>
Death to self the do<strong>orway into discipleship. Then he said to the</strong>m all: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it (Luke 9:23-24).<br>
Death to self requir<strong>es a choice. Put to death, there</strong>fore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming (Colossians 3:5-6).<br>
Death to self so sin<strong> will not master us. In the same way, co</strong>unt yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace (Romans 6:11- 14).<br>
Death to self goes b<strong>efore life in Christ. Now if we died with</strong> Christ, we believe that we will also live with him (Romans 6:8).<br>
Death to self every <strong>day. I die daily (1 Cori</strong>nthians 15:31).<br>
Dying to reflect Jes<strong>us. Until self is laid </strong>upon the altar of sacrifice, Christ will not be reflected in the character. When self is buried, and Christ occupies the throne of the heart, there will be a revelation of principles that will clear the moral atmosphere surrounding the soul (Letter 108, 1899, MS 1903).<br>
Death provides space<strong> for Jesus. We must be emptied </strong>of self in order to give room to Jesus, but how many have their hearts so filled with idols that they have no room for the Redeemer of the world. The world holds the hearts of men in captivity. They center their thoughts and affections upon their business, their position, their family. They hold to their opinions and ways, and cherish them as idols in the soul; but we cannot afford to yield ourselves to the ervice of self, holding to our own ways and ideas, and excluding the truth of God. We must be emptied of self. But this is not all that is required; for when we have renounced our idols, the vacuum must be supplied. If the heart is left desolate, and the vacuum not supplied, it will be in the condition of him whose house was “empty, swept, and garnished,” garnished,” but without a guest to occupy it. The evil spirit took unto himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they entered in and dwelt there; and the last state of that man was worse than the first (RH, February 23, 1892).<br>
Complete death. God <strong>will breathe th</strong>is life into every soul who dies to self and lives to Christ. But entire self-renunciation is required. Unless this takes place, we carry with us the evil that destroys our happiness. I wish we could be what God would have us,--all light in the Lord. We need to reach a higher standard. But we can never do this until self is laid on the altar, until we let the Holy Spirit control us, molding and fashioning us according to the divine similitude (ST, October 11, 1899).<br>
Daily death. Those w<strong>ho work for </strong>God are daily to empty the heart of self, that they may be cleansed of their hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong. They are to depend wholly upon Him who taught as never man taught. Unless the soultemple is daily emptied of self, and prepared for the reception of the Holy Spirit, self will rule the entire being. The words and acts will be tarnished with selfishness. Christ will not appear in the life; but there will be seen a self-confidence that is wholly different from His character (SW January 29, 1903).<br>
Easy living after de<strong>ath. Why is it so hard t</strong>o lead a selfdenying, humble life? Because professed Christians are not dead to the world. It is easy living after we are dead (Messages to Young People 127 Testimony for the Church January 6, 1863).<br>
No Chrisitianity wit<strong>hout death. Self is prominent. </strong>When self is crucified, then this sensitiveness, or pride, will die; until then you are not a Christian (2T 572).<br>
Surrender of the wil<strong>l. It is necessary tha</strong>t the will should be sanctified. In surrendering the will, the root of the matter is reached. When the will is surrendered, the streams that flow from the fountain will not be bitter, but will be as pure as crystal. The flowers and fruit of Christian life will bloom and ripen to perfection (ST, October 29, 1894).<br>
Dead people cannot f<strong>eel. You have repeatedly</strong> said: “I can’t keep my temper.” “I have to speak.” You lack a meek, humble spirit. Self is all alive, and you stand guard continually to preserve it from mortification or insult. Says the apostle: “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.” Those who are dead to self will not feel so readily and will not be prepared to resist everything which may irritate. Dead men cannot feel. You are not dead. If you were, and your life were hid in Christ, a thousand things which you now notice, and which afflict you, would be passed by as unworthy of notice; you would then be grasping the eternal and would be above the petty trials of this life (2T 425).<br>
Death through suffer<strong>ing. We are forming char</strong>acters for heaven. No character can be complete without trial and suffering. We must be tested, we must be tried. Christ bore the test of character in our behalf that we might bear this test in our own behalf through the divine strength He has brought to us. Christ is our example in patience, in forbearance, in meekness and lowliness of mind. He was at variance and at war with the whole ungodly world, yet He did not give way to passion and violence manifested in words and actions, although receiving shameful abuse in return for good works. He was afflicted, He was rejected and despitefully treated, yet He retaliated not. He possessed self-control, dignity, and majesty. He suffered with calmness and for abuse gave only compassion, pity, and love (3MR 427).<br>
Death and God’s disc<strong>ipline. “As many as I love,</strong>” God says, “I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent,” In order that we may die to self, we are called upon to endure trial, and when the chastening hand of the Lord is laid upon us, we are not to fret and complain, not to rebel, not to worry ourselves out of the hand of Christ. We are to humble ourselves before God, pleading with him to give us rest and peace. We enter the furnace of affliction with our hearts darkened by selfishness; but if patient under the crucial test, we shall come forth reflecting the divine image, as gold tried in the fire (ST, December 10, 1896).<br>
Death and trials. Th<strong>e Lord permits tr</strong>ials to come to us in order that we may be cleansed from earthliness, from selfishness, from sharp, unchristlike traits of character; that we may be led to look to him as the source of all strength. He suffers the deep waves of affliction to pass over our souls in order that we may have deep heart-longings to be cleansed from all defilement, and come forth from the trial purer and holier, with a deeper knowledge of him (ST, December 10, 1896 par. 8).<br>
Death—the greatest b<strong>attle. The Christian life </strong>is a battle and a march. But the victory to be gained is not won by human power. The field of conflict is the domain of the heart. The battle which we have to fight--the greatest battle that was ever fought by man--is the surrender of self to the will of God, the yielding of the heart to the sovereignty of love. The old nature, born of blood and of the will of the flesh, cannot inherit the kingdom of God. The hereditary tendencies, the former habits, must be given up (MB 141.2).<br>
Without dying we are<strong> helpless. He who determines t</strong>o enter the spiritual kingdom will find that all the powers and passions of an unregenerate nature, backed by the forces of the kingdom of darkness, are arrayed against him. Selfishness and pride will make a stand against anything that would show them to be sinful. We cannot, of ourselves, conquer the evil desires and habits that strive for the mastery. We cannot overcome the mighty foe who holds us in His thrall. God alone can give us the victory. He desires us to have the mastery over ourselves, our own will and ways. But He cannot work in us without our consent and co-operation. The divine Spirit works through the faculties and powers given to man. Our energies are required to co-operate with God (MB 141.3).<br>
Voluntary death. The<strong> victory is not w</strong>on without much earnest prayer, without the humbling of self at every step. Our will is not to be forced into co-operation with divine agencies, but it must be voluntarily submitted. Were it possible to force upon you with a hundredfold greater intensity the influence of the Spirit of God, it would not make you a Christian, a fit subject for heaven. The stronghold of Satan would not be broken. The will must be placed on the side of God’s will. You are not able, of yourself, to bring your purposes and desires and inclinations into submission to the will of God; but if you are “willing to be made willing,” God will accomplish the work for you, even “casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” 2 Corinthians 10:5. <br>
Then you will “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” Philippians 2:12, 13 (MB 142).<br>
21.Death now! You n<strong>eed not be worr</strong>ied. You need not be thinking that there is a special time coming when you are to be crucified. The time to be crucified is just now. Every day, every hour, self is to die; self is to be crucified; and then, when the time comes that the test shall come to God’s people in earnest, the everlasting arms are around you. The angels of God make a wall of fire around about and deliver you (UL 283).<br>
22.Death as prepara<strong>tion for the second coming. In a view given Jun</strong>e 27, 1850, my accompanying angel said, “Time is almost finished. Do you reflect the lovely image of Jesus as you should?” Then I was pointed to the earth and saw that there would have to be a getting ready among those who have of late embraced the third angel’s message. Said the angel, “Get ready, get ready, get ready.

The term “baptism of the Holy Spirit” may be new to some people. Others may be cautious as it is a term that some have filled with unbiblical meaning. The purpose of this lesson is to consider a clearly biblical understanding and application of this important work of the Holy Spirit and place it in the context of an Ambassador’s life.<br>

Welcome a</strong>nd opening</span><span style="color:#000000;"> prayer (1 min).<br>
Explain what participants can expect to learn in this lesson (1 min).<br>
Explain that the group is going to think about consequences for a few minutes. For example, if you throw a stone into the air, it will always fall down. That is the consequence of living in a world where gravity exists.<br>
Ask the group to divide into groups. Give each group a large sheet of paper and markers. Ask them to draw a picture entitled “inevitable consequences” (5 minutes).<br>
Ask each group to share their picture with the rest of the group.<br>
Explain that the filling or baptism of the Holy Spirit is a consequence of dying to self—as we will see further explained later in this lesson.<br>
Complete the “mission briefing” handout for participants to discuss in groups of two or three (10 min).<br>
Leaders should move around the room to listen to conversations to ensure participants are going in the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
Before moving on, summarize the question and answers in this section and ask for any final comments or questions (5 min).<br>
Once finished, participants can move immediately into the next section, “thinking it through.”<br>
Give participants five minutes to write down their own answers by themselves.<br>
Next, ask participants to share their reflections with the others they studied with in the “mission briefing” section.<br>
As with last week, ask the group to divide into small groups to discuss the Bible texts and quotations by Ellen White on the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<br>
Ask each group to find one striking quote to share with the group (15 min).<br>
Discuss: Why do you think there is a link between prayer and the coming of the Holy Spirit? (See quote 2). If the disciples were working miracles under the power of the Holy Spirit during their ministry with Jesus, why do you think Ellen White says that they still needed to wait for the baptism of the Holy Spirit? What are the implications for us? (see quote 12) (10 min).<br>
                                       <br>
112&nbsp; 1: I am an amb<strong>assad</strong>or for another world<br>
Summary: explain to the group that many of the quotations reveal the same principle that was seen in the Bible—that divine fire falls once there is a waiting sacrifice. To become a sacrifice—and therefore to be filled with the Holy Spirit—does not come by accident, but by a personal choice to live utterly for God.<br>
Note: this principle about the relationship between sacrifice and the Holy Spirit helps to guard us against false outpourings of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit only comes when there is genuine confession of sin and death to self.<br>
Ask participants to spend a moment of personal reflection on the baptism of the Holy Spirit and write any observations in the space provided.<br>

A</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>t the beginning </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">of </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">the tabernacle and temple services, where did the fire that was used for the sanctuary services come from (Leviticus 9:24; 2 Chronicles 7:1)?<br>

There is an importa</span><span style="color:#000000;">n</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">t principle to understand. Divine fire fell from heaven because a sacrifice was waiting. If a sacrifice had not been placed on the altar, God would not have sent any fire because the fire needed a sacrifice to consume.<br>
God repeated to His</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">priests that the fire “must not go out” (Leviticus 6:8-9, 12-13). This was because the fire was divine fire and only holy fire could be used in the holy sanctuary. But how was this divine fire to be kept burning? While the priests could use branches of wood, it was really the continual placing of sacrifices on the altar that kept the fire alight. Without continual sacrifice, the divine fire would die.<br>
2.Read Matthew 3:1</span><span style="color:#000000;">6</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">. When does the Holy Spirit descend on Jesus?<br>

Baptism symbolizes </span><span style="color:#000000;">d</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">eath to the old life. When someone is baptized, they go completely under the water to show that their old life has been put in the grave. However, they then rise to a new life. This is a life that is empowered by the Holy Spirit. It is after Jesus has come up from the watery grave of the Jordan river that the divine fire of the Holy Spirit came down out of heaven.<br>
Later, Paul used th</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> language of the sanctuary services when he urged His readers to offer themselves as “living sacrifices” (Romans 12:1). He also uses similar sanctuary language that echos God’s instruction to the priests that the fire should not go out. He counsels Timothy to “fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you” (2 Timothy 1:6), and urges, “do not quench the Spirit” (1 Thessalonians 5:19).<br>
Becoming a sacrific</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> and receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit are two sides of the same coin. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a consequence of becoming a sacrifice. As Jesus says that a disciple must go to death daily (Luke 9:23), so being baptized by the Holy Spirit happens afresh each day. In this way, Ambassadors serve with divine power, not merely by their own efforts.<br>

Jesus as an exampl</span><span style="color:#961933;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <strong>of death to self and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. As soon as Jesus wa</strong>s baptised, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:16-17).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit after prayer. They all joined tog</strong>ether constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers... All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them (Acts 1:14; 2:4).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit for service. Then the LORD said </strong>to Moses, “See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts (Exodus 31:1-5).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit to proclaim Jesus. Then Peter, filled </strong>with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked howvhe was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. Jesus is “ ‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.’ Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:8-12).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit and joy in the middle of problems. The word of the Lor</strong>d spread through the whole region. But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region. So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit (Acts 14:49-52).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit leads to joy. The Be very careful</strong>, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (Ephesians 5:15-20).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit comes from Jesus. I baptise you with </strong>water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit (Mark 1:8).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit enables unity in diversity. For we were all bap</strong>tised by one Spirit so as to form one body— whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many (1 Corinthians 12:13-14).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit enables obedience. I will give you a n</strong>ew heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws (Ezekiel 36:26-27).<br>
Preparation for the <strong>baptism of the Holy Spirit. When the heart is e</strong>mptied of self, it will be ready for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and then you will be fitted to strengthen the sheep and lambs of the flock of Christ; for self will be hid with Christ in God (ST, August 1, 1892).<br>
Jesus received a dai<strong>ly baptism of the Holy Spirit. From hours spent wi</strong>th God He came forth morning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. Daily He received a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. In the early hours of the new day the Lord awakened Him from His slumbers, and His soul and His lips were anointed with grace, that He might impart to others (RH Aug. 11, 1910).<br>
Counsel to parents f<strong>or teaching their children about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Teach your children</strong> that it is their privilege to receive every day the baptism of the Holy Spirit... By prayer you may gain an experience that will make your ministry for your children a perfect success (CT 131).<br>
Necessity of the bap<strong>tism of the Holy Spirit. What we need is the</strong> baptism of the Holy Spirit. Without this, we are no more fitted to go forth to the world than were the disciples after the crucifixion of their Lord. Jesus knew their destitution, and told them to tarry in Jerusalem until they should be endowed with power from on high (1 Selected Messages, 411).<br>
Our need for the bap<strong>tism of the Holy Spirit. O how we need the d</strong>ivine Presence! For the baptism of the Holy Spirit, every worker should be breathing out His prayers to God. Companies should be gathered together to call upon God for special help, for heavenly wisdom, that the people of God may know how to plan and devise and execute the work. Especially should men pray that the Lord will choose His agents, and baptize His missionaries with the Holy Spirit. For ten days the disciples prayed before the Pentecostal blessing prayed before the Pentecostal blessing came. It needed all that time to bring them to an understanding of what it meant to offer effectual prayer, drawing nearer and nearer to God, confessing their sins, humbling their hearts before God, and by faith beholding Jesus, and becoming changed into His image. When the blessing did come, it filled all the place where they were assembled; and endowed with power, they went forth to do effectual work for the Master (HM, November 1, 1893 par. 2).<br>
Baptized by the Holy<strong> Spirit and sharing with friends. The atmosphere of t</strong>he church is so frigid, its spirit is of such an order, that men and women cannot sustain or endure the example of primitive and heaven-born piety. The warmth of their first love is frozen up, and unless they are watered over by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, their candlestick will be removed out of its place, except they repent and do their first works. The first works of the church were seen when the believers sought out friends, relatives, and acquaintances, and with hearts overflowing with love, told the story of what Jesus was to them and what they were to Jesus (TM 167).<br>
Baptism of the Holy <strong>Spirit leads to humility. The baptism of the </strong>Holy Spirit will dispel human imaginings, will break down self-erected barriers, and will cause to cease the feeling that “I am holier than thou.” There will be a humble spirit with all, more faith and love; self will not be exalted. . . . Christ’s spirit, Christ’s example, will be exemplified in His people. We shall follow more closely the ways and works of Jesus. . . . The love of Jesus will pervade our hearts (TMK 114).<br>
The baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit leads to revival. The baptism of the </strong>Holy Ghost as on the day of Pentecost will lead to a revival of true religion and to the performance of many wonderful works. Heavenly intelligences will come among us, and men will speak <br>
as they are moved upon by the Holy Spirit of God. But should the Lord work upon men as He did on and after the day of Pentecost, many who now claim to believe the truth would know so very little of the operation of the Holy Spirit that they would cry, “Beware of fanaticism.” They would say of those who were filled with the Spirit, “These men are full of new wine” (CT, 371.4).<br>
18.A deeper longing<strong> for God and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The time is not far</strong> off now when men will want a much closer relation to Christ, a much closer union with His Holy Spirit, than ever they have had, or will have, unless they give up their will and their way, and submit to God’s will and God’s way. The great sin of those who profess to be Christians is that they do not open the heart to receive the Holy Spirit. When souls long after Christ, and seek to become one with Him, then those who are content with the form of godliness, exclaim “Be careful, do not go to extremes.” When the angels of heaven come among us, and work through human agents, there will be solid, substantial conversions, after the order of the conversions after the day of Pentecost (2SM 57.2).<br>
19.Baptism of the H<strong>oly Spirit and a knowledge of the truth. An intellectual kno</strong>wledge of the truth is not enough; we must know its power upon our own hearts and lives. Ministers need to come to Christ as little children. Seek Jesus, brethren, confess your sins, plead with God day and night, until you know that for Christ’s sake you are pardoned and accepted. Then will you love much because you have been forgiven much. Then you can point others to Christ as a sin-pardoning Redeemer. Then you can present the truth from the fullness of a heart that feels its sanctifying power. I fear for you, my brethren. I counsel you to tarry at Jerusalem, as did the early disciples, until, like them, you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Never feel at liberty to go into the desk until you have by faith grasped the arm of your strength (5T 159).<br>
20.Longing for a fr<strong>esh baptism of the Spirit. Oh, that we might b</strong>e children of God! Oh, that we might every one be humble sons and daughters of God! Oh, that we might have another touch of the Holy Spirit, and every heart be moved before we leave this house. Oh, that we might have a baptism of the Holy Ghost before we separate. Oh, that the love of Jesus might gladden our hearts with sweet music like a song of heaven, because the wickedness of our hearts is broken down and it may be truly said, “See how these brethren love one another” (2 SAT 15).<br>
21.False baptism of<strong> the Spirit. Some of these have </strong>much to say upon the gifts and are often especially exercised. They give themselves up to wild, excitable feelings and make unintelligible sounds which they call the gift of tongues, and a certain class seem to be charmed with these strange manifestations. A strange spirit rules with this class, which would bear down and run over anyone who would reprove them. God’s Spirit is not in the work and does not attend such workmen. They have another spirit (1T 414).<br>
22.Fresh baptism of<strong> the Holy Spirit leads to witness. The very first impu</strong>lse of the renewed heart is to bring others also to the Savior. Those who do not possess this desire give evidence that they have lost their first love; they should closely examine their own hearts in the light of God’s Word, and earnestly seek a fresh baptism of the Spirit of Christ; they should pray for a deeper comprehension of that wondrous love which Jesus manifested for us in leaving the realms of glory and coming to a fallen world to save the perishing (Welfare Ministry, 55).<br>

Welcome a</strong>nd opening</span><span style="color:#000000;"> prayer (1 min).<br>
Explain what participants can expect to learn in this lesson (1 min).<br>
Ask everyone to get into groups of two or three.<br>
Group question: Have you ever tried to do something for God but you hadn’t prayed before you did it? What was it like? What differences are there between ministering for God with and without being spiritually prepared first? How does this affect the way you think and feel? (3 min)<br>
Group feedback (3 min). If you have a board, divide it into two. Give one column the title, “working for God without His power,” and the second, “working for God with His power.” List the group reflections in these categories.<br>
Go over the content of this section in the handout (2 min).<br>
Complete the “mission briefing” handout for participants to discuss in groups of two or three (10 min).<br>
Leaders should move around the room to listen to conversations to ensure participants are going in the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
Before moving on, summarize the question and answers in this section and ask for any final comments or questions (5 min).<br>
Once finished, participants can move immediately into the next section, “thinking it through.”<br>
Give participants five minutes to write down their own answers by themselves.<br>
Next, ask participants to share their reflections with the others they studied with in the “mission briefing” section.<br>
Exercise 1<br>
1. Expla<strong>in: the thr</strong>ee offerings in the Holy Place of the sanctuary provide us with a helpful way to think about our priorities as Ambassadors (see summary diagram of the sanctuary in the handout). These three priorities are holding out the Word of God (bread), revealing Christlike character (light), and intercession (incense). While these three things are important to us personally, these three priorities were performed by the priests on behalf of others. In other words, what happened each day in the Holy Place is about how we as God’s priests minister to other people.<br>

126&nbsp; 1: I am an amb<strong>assad</strong>or for another world<br>
Ask participants to do the exercise individually for this section in the handout (10 min).<br>
Ask partipants to share their reflections in small groups (5 min).<br>
Exercise 2<br>
In the ha<strong>ndout, ther</strong>e are five summary diagrams. Diagram 1 is a summary of the sanctuary.<br>
Diagram 2 is the cycle of the continuous re-formation of our lives that is based on the dynamics of Diagram 1. This is a diagram that you will have seen during the last few lessons.<br>
Diagram 3 rearranges diagram 2 so we can clearly see God’s role in transformation and ours.<br>
Diagram 4 looks at what might happen if our spiritual lives stop at any of these points. If we are not open, we don’t really trust God and refuse to die to self.<br>
Diagram 5 makes some suggestions of what to think about if we find ourselves spiritually stuck in one of these areas.<br>
Go through the first three diagrams to check that people understand them.<br>
Ask the group to look at Diagram 4. Ask them if they agree with the suggested consequences of being stuck in each of those areas. Is there anything they would add to each of the lists?<br>
Go through Diagram 5 and ask the same—how would they help another person who has become spiritually stuck in a) their openness to God, b) their faith, c) dying to self?<br>
This section could take a lot of time, so do check that you keep within the overall time allocation.<br>
next steps1. Have </span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>the Spiritu</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">al Companions discuss the following questions with each other and pray:<br>

How is your spiritual life going and your IDP?<br>
How can I pray for you—for your spiritual life and your IDP? <br>

Jesus says that He is the vine and we are branches attached to Him (John 15). When we are connected, the sap—<br>
His nature—is able to flow from Him into us. Then we will automatically bear fruit because His own nature—His <br>
character—is now inside us through the presence of His Spirit (Galatians 5:22-24). But we have to be connected at all <br>
times, because the moment we are disconnected from Him, we are disconnected from His nature. When this happens, <br>
we are exposed to the temptation of trying to live like Christians, but without divine power!<br>

                                       </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
W</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>hen we become “l</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">ivi</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ng sacrifices” (Romans 12:1) and God fills us with Himself through His Spirit, our hearts naturally reflect who God is and what God does. But what is God doing?<br>
God’s priorities fo</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> His kingdom are highlighted in the morning and evening services of the Sanctuary. Every day, three offerings were tended by the priests in the Holy Place—the offering of bread, symbolizing God’s words, light that symbolized God’s character, and incense that symbolized God’s intercession.<br>
It is critical to n</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">tice that if the sacrifices stopped, the holy fire would die out. If the holy fire died, the priests would not be able to continue their daily ministry in the Holy Place because the three offerings required holy fire. Only holy fire could be used in the Holy Place.<br>
The daily work of t</span><span style="color:#000000;">h</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">e priests in the Holy Place represents the continual work of Christ on our behalf. Jesus became a sacrifice and was filled with the divine fire of the Holy Spirit. His ministry highlighted the three priorities of the Holy Place because He is the light of the world (John 8:12), the bread of life (John 6:51), and our intercessor (Hebrews 7:25).<br>
1. Read 1 Peter 2:</span><span style="color:#000000;">9</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">, Matthew 5:14, Acts 4:31, and Ephesians 6:18. Why do you think reflecting the light of God’s character, preaching His words, and interceding for others all need to be consequences of a daily death and baptism of the Holy Spirit?<br>

As holy fire was ne</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ded for the priests every day to tend the three sacrifices, so the holy fire of the Holy Spirit is needed by us every day so we can be the light of the world, hold out the word of God to others, and intercede for them. We can try and do these things in our own strength, but the results will be insignificant. Only when we reflect Christ by becoming living sacrifices and being baptized daily with the fire of His Holy Spirit can God accomplish holy work through us.<br>

DRAWGive everyone a piece of paper and a pencil. Allow fiv</span><span style="color:#000000;">e m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>inut</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">s to draw a picture that conveys who they are without writing any words or numbers. At the end of five minutes the leader collects the pictures. Show the pictures to the group, one at a time, and have them try to guess who drew it. Each artist can then explain how their work expresses who they are.<br>
FREEZE FRAMEInvite the young people to quietly move around t</span><span style="color:#000000;">he ro</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>om and await</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">your instructions. As they are walking the leader calls out the name of a sport, for example, golf, soccer, rugby, swimming, parachuting, polo, basketball, horse racing etc. When they hear the name they must stop immediately and hold a still ‘freeze frame’ illustrating or acting out the sport. You can play variations to the game by shouting out emotions, job titles, or even animals.<br>
WORD LINKThis is a word association game. Ask the group to sit i</span><span style="color:#000000;">n a c</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>ircle. Th</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> first person starts with any word they wish, i.e. “red.” The next person repeats the first word and adds another word that links to the first, i.e.” tomato.” The next person repeats the previous word and adds another word link, i.e. “soup,” and so on. To keep this moving, only allow five seconds for each word link. See how many linking words your group can get.<br>
TWENTY QUESTIONSTwenty questions is an old party game that encourage</span><span style="color:#000000;">s ded</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>uctive reasoning</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">and creativity. One player is selected to think of an item. The rest of the group tries to guess the item by asking a question that can only be answered with a simple “Yes” or “No.” Truthful answers only please, as anything else will ruin the game.<br>
BACKWARD CLUMPSDivide into pairs. Ask each pair to sit on the floor with</span><span style="color:#000000;"> thei</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>r partner, back</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> together, feet out in front and arms linked. Their task is to stand up together. Once everyone has done this, two pairs join together and the group of four try to repeat the task. After they succeed, add another two and try again. Keep adding people until your whole group is trying to stand together. A sight to behold!<br>
ONE MINUTE PLEASE!The aim of the game is to talk for one minute on a given s</span><span style="color:#000000;">ubjec</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>t. You announce th</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> topic and a member of the group is randomly selected to speak for one minute. Use a pack of cards to randomly select, i.e. person who draws the lowest number. Choose subjects to stimulate the imagination and which may be amusing. Put a stopwatch on each person to see how long they last before drying up! Subjects might include my earliest memories, my favorite computer game, why beans are good for you, 10 things you can do with potatoes, Alligator wrestling, pre-millennialism (no, not really!)<br>

SHOE TALKSplit the group into two halves. Get each half of the group to line up against op</span><span style="color:#000000;">pos</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>ite sides</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">of the room or hall. Then get each person to take off one shoe and make a pile of their team’s shoes. Get each person from one team to select a random shoe from the other team’s pile and then find the person that shoe belongs to. Once they have found their match, have a question ready so each person in the pair can ask and get to know each other a little bit better. Get the other team to do the same process with the first team’s pile of shoes.<br>
TEAM ARCHITECTTeam Architect is basically a game where you get each team to build something </span><span style="color:#000000;">with </span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>very little am</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">unts of strange materials. For example, you could give each team a packet of pop sticks and a roll of sticky tape and get them to build a bridge that will support a heavy book.<br>
Another example is to give each team a few sheets of newspaper and some string and then get them </span><span style="color:#000000;">to </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">make an egg support. Each team’s egg support has to stop the egg from breaking when dropped from a certain height.<br>
After the allocated building time is up, all the groups come together and the structures or inventi</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ns are tested.<br>

community service project planning module 1: DISCIPLE</span><span style="color:#000000;">S<strong>HIP<br>
i</strong>ntroductionThe goal is to identify a nee</span><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">dy cause and devise a medium/long-term plan to meet that </span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>need in the co</strong>mmunity. The emphasis is on the project being local and the participation being sustained over a period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Introduce the idea of an Ambassadors’ community service project. Describe it as an integral part of</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">the Ambassadors’ experience that begins now.<br>
It would be advisable to do some prior research before approaching your group with the following ta</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ks or you can choose to begin the process with the participants. <br>
Identify a needy cause in the community that would benefit from the Ambassador’s help. You might co</span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">e prepared with a list of services offered in your community that need volunteer help or start brainstorming with the group. At some stage, this will require some research and consultation with volunteer services and the city/village council. Examples might include:<br>
Health services<br>
Mentoring<br>
Community clean-up<br>
Vulnerable citizen help (e.g. children of prison inmat</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">s)<br>
Vulnerable f</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">milies su</span><span style="color:#000000;">p</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">port<br>
Food services</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">Seminars and classes<br>
Community events<br>
Fundraising<br>
Explore</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">as many options as possible</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">and do a real</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">stic evaluation of e</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ch one on the ba</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">is of your </span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">esources, time, and personnel. <br>
Choosing the Project<br>
Vote/decide on a short list of three or four for closer evaluation.<br>
It would b</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> advisable to do a s</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">te visit of the short list.<br>
Have a feed-back session after the visi</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">.<br>
Prayerfully, choose the final project.<br>
Get ready to parti</span><span style="color:#000000;">c</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ipate in the community service project.<br>
P</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">esent the idea that serving others wit</span><span style="color:#000000;">h</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> a loving heart and without any conditions requires some s</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">lf-assessment and re-consecration to God.<br>
Take some minutes to lead the participants in the following: In the participant guide, write down y</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ur reaction to the idea that you will give away your time and effort for free. Write down what you really feel about it, not what you think you should feel. If you find any objections in your mind to giving time and effort to others, write those down too. Apply the Golden Rule to the plans the group has made. Write down your reaction to giving to others what you’d like to receive if you were in their “shoes” (their situation). Write a commitment statement that expresses what you pledge to do for God through serving the chosen group in the community.<br>
Plan a field trip to the final project site.<br>
Sign up participants so that all have a commitment to </span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> time and place for the visit.<br>
Make the visi</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"> a combination of learning the details of the organization’s work and some time that </span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">he participants spend doing a sample of the work.<br>
At the visit itself, ask participants to think about their experience and prepare to debrief at the</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">next session when you will ask them to share their reactions to the community service visit.<br>
Assuming that the response is positive and the group seems ready to proceed, ask participants to as</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ist you in planning the following: a. Decide on overall goal<br>
Define tasks involved<br>
Determine time commitment and schedule<br>
Assign volunteer positions and duties </span><span style="color:#000000;">(</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">a mix of leaders and </span><span style="color:#000000;">p</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">articipants)<br>
Seek permissions if neede</span><span style="color:#000000;">d</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><br>
Work on budget if applicable<br>
Obtain insurance if applicable<br>
Plan for equ</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">pment and supplies if appl</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">cable<br>
Plan for regular evalu</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">tion of goals<br>

Get a clear list from the organi</span><span style="color:#000000;">z</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ation’s representative that states expectations and requirements.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#000000;">I</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">n situations that require background clearance, arrange for background checks.<br>
Take time to coordi</span><span style="color:#000000;">n</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ate participants and sign them up for particular times and dates of service.<br>
Cr</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ate and show a record in which you will log the main activities of the group.<br>
Record the plans a</span><span style="color:#000000;">n</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">d share aspects of it and progress at each session.<br>
                                       <br>
At the end of the module<br>
Take a careful look at how t</span><span style="color:#000000;">h<strong>e act</strong>ivity is developing. Is the group truly m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>eeting the needs identif</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>i</strong></span><span style="color:#221F1F;">ed at the beginning of the module? Does the activity seem to fit the group? What is God telling you about what has happened so far?<br>
mid-way through the module1. <br>
2. It’s time for a formal review of the initial community service e</span><span style="color:#000000;">ffo</span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><strong>rts.<br>
You can prepare a for</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">al </span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">evi</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">w form or simply record in the log the responses given by participants.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;">4.Take the participants through some minutes of free-flowing discussion of their experience.<br>
5.Stee</span><span style="color:#000000;">r t</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">hem toward the goals of serving the community without condition and for no reason but to give</span><span style="color:#000000;">.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#221F1F;"><br>
Celebrate what has been accomplished thus far.<br>
Decide if the group will continue with the same project </span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">r choose a new one for the next module.<br>
The de</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#221F1F;">igners of the Ambassador program would encourage continuity as much as possible.<br>

                                       <strong>Welcome to Ambassadors</strong><br>
                                       <br>
Ambassadors is a new level of youth ministry designed to equip leaders with resources to train a new generation of youths to be the hands, feet, and voice of Jesus in their local churches and communities.<br>
                                       <br>
An ambassador generally represents a country or a cause. A Christian ambassador is a representative of another kind; they represent the values, principles, culture, and laws of the kingdom of God. They stand for the character and purpose of the King of this kingdom—Jesus Christ, Himself.<br>
                                       <br>
This Youth Department resource is based on seven foundations that are considered as essential to meet the developmental needs of our young people between the ages of 16-21. <br>
                                       <br>
They include:<br>
                                       <br>
1. A Christ-centered discipleship plan<br>
2. Leadership development<br>
3. A personal, public, and small group based mission lifestyle<br>
4. Character and personality development, including outdoor, high adventure programming<br>
5. Lifestyle and vocational training<br>
6. Nurturing godly relationships<br>
7. Community outreach development through service projects and emergency preparedness training<br>
                                       <br>
Each of these seven foundations will be presented in modules, with participants gaining certification for each module completed. While<br>
each module has a specific focus, there are FOUR elements that will be common throughout the curriculum. Leaders MUST ensure that all these elements are embraced to make the experience meaningful, attractive, and challenging.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>1. First - The concept of a spiritual companion</strong><br>
At the beginning of each module, each participant will choose a friend who will be their companion for the duration of the module. They will meet during each session to encourage and support each other in their role and growth as an Ambassador. Groups of spiritual companions will also come together for specific activities. This builds the concept of interdependence and accountability into the Ambassador experience.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>2. Second - An Individual Discipleship Plan (IDP)</strong><br>
At the beginning of every module, each participant will make a simple plan of how they would like to grow spiritually and acquire practical competency in the area of the upcoming module. Their spiritual companion will be there throughout the module to help and encourage them to accomplish their plan. The IDP helps to emphasize the continuing nature of discipleship and that learning is a continual part of life. By linking spiritual companions together for this work, it stresses the need for interdependence on each other as we learn, grow, and work for God.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>3. Third - Projects<br>
                                       </strong>Each module will have a project that will integrate the core concepts from the module into a service learning activity focused on helping others. This will be an opportunity for the Ambassador class to work together as a whole. You will find INSTRUCTIONS for setting up your project in the back pages of this Leader’s Guide. You might have to plan for multiple projects, depending on the size of your group.<br>
                                       <br>
• The main objective is to incorporate service as a way of life, rather than an occasional activity.<br>
• Aim for projects that would call for regular involvement over a period of time.<br>
• Make contact with your Volunteer Service organizations, the local Council, and other entities that could assist you.<br>
• If your group settles on a particular medium/long term project, there is no need to change the project when the time comes to engage with a new module. Use your discretion.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>4. Fourth - Social Activities </strong><br>
Ensure that you plan for a social activity at least once a month. Make sure that you always provide opportunities for good and wholesome fun for that age group.<br>
• You do not have to conduct all your sessions in a building. As appropriate, conduct some in nature, in the context of a camp, in<br>
someone’s home, etc.<br>
• In the back pages of your Leader’s Guide you will find a list of websites where you can access ‘Ice Breakers’ or brief fun activities that you can inject into all your sessions.<br>
                                       <br>
Of course, CONDUCT ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES PRAYERFULLY.<br>
RECOMMENDATION<br>
                                       <br>
It is highly recommended that you set aside your first meeting as a fun ORIENTATION to share the Ambassadors concept, share the Participant’s Guides, give an overview of the first module, discuss the FOUR elements and their implementation, discuss the frequency of meetings, organize calendars, etc.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <em>Participant’s Guide</em><br>
A participant’s guide for each module has been prepared for each participant.<br>
• The Participant’s Guide is essentially the workbook containing all the sessions of each module that the participant will engage with.<br>
• In the back pages of each module there is a page for creating the IDP. There is also a list of the sessions for that module that the leader will date and sign upon the participant’s completion.<br>
• Each participant will be required to complete 75 percent attendance and participation to receive the certification or award at the end of each module. Participants can make-up for missed lessons to achieve the required 75 percent at the discretion of their leader.<br>
                                       <br>
Fostering togetherness is at the heart of a model for discipleship, which the General Conference is focusing on; it is known as “Together<br>
Growing Fruitful Disciples.” This model emphasizes understanding, connecting, equipping, and ministering—but doing all of this<br>
“together.” For God did not design us to grow or minister alone, but in community. Paul writes that growing in Christ is achieved as<br>
everyone uses the gifts God has given to them, “until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become<br>
mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13).<br>
                                       <br>
Thank you for helping to educate our young people to become Ambassadors of Jesus Christ and His kingdom.<br>

1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
As a human being with a nature that naturally tends to move away from God, growing to reflect Jesus as an Ambassador will rarely happen by chance or without much thought. That’s why for each of the Ambassador’s modules, you will be creating your own IDP. The focus of each IDP will relate to the theme of your current module and last for the duration of that module. Here is an example of what an IDP will look like. Fill in your own IDP on the form provided.<br>
                                       <br>
1. IDP Module Name:<br>
CHRIST-CENTERED DISCIPLESHIP<br>
                                       <br>
2. Spiritual Companion: Who is the spiritual companion who will encourage and support you in the next stage of your spiritual journey of<br>
growing as an Ambassador of Jesus? They will remain your spiritual companion throughout the current module. JOHN WILCOX (Your choice of spiritual companion is added in session Leave blank for now.)<br>
                                       <br>
3. Personal vision statement: This includes two parts: <br>
(a) What do you see in your life today that you would like to change in order to become more effective as an Ambassador for Jesus? <br>
(b) Describe how you would like to see yourself in the future. Before you start writing, take a moment to pray for God to guide your thoughts.<br>
                                       <br>
• CURRENTLY, I DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR OR VERY MEANINGFUL DEVOTIONAL LIFE.<br>
• I WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP A DEVOTIONAL LIFE THAT CAN EQUIP ME SPIRITUALLY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR FOR JESUS.<br>
                                       <br>
4. Expected evidence of change: After looking at your personal vision statement, list the evidence you might expect to see that reveals you are<br>
growing in Christ.<br>
• I THINK AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR IS SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS PRAYING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO REVEAL THE CHARACTER OF JESUS<br>
WHEREVER THEY GO. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR MY LIFE.<br>
                                       <br>
5. Next steps: List the practical steps you will take to accomplish your personal discipleship vision. Think about how these steps will also<br>
shape your daily devotions with God.<br>
• SET MY ALARM CLOCK FOR 7AM TO START MY DEVOTIONS<br>
• SPEND 30 MINUTES IN PRAYER AND BIBLE READING<br>
• REPEAT BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP<br>
• FIND A BOOK TO READ THAT TEACHES DIFFERENT WAYS TO STUDY THE BIBLE<br>
• PRAY EACH DAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME AS HIS AMBASSADOR<br>

6. Reflection: How did I do? This is completed at the end of the module. It gives you a chance to reflect on what worked well and what you<br>
would like to improve in the future. You can compare your expected evidences of change to what actually happened.<br>

• I REALLY ENJOYED THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. THE MORE I READ AND UNDERSTOOD, THE MORE CONFIDENT I BECAME TO PRAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME. I THINK I WILL EXPAND THE TIME FOR DEVOTIONS I HAVE IN THE EVENING, AND NOW THAT I HAVE READ A BOOK ON BIBLE STUDY, I WOULD LIKE TO READ ANOTHER ON INTERCESSORY PRAYER. I HAVE FOUND THAT I REALLY ENJOY PRAYING FOR OTHERS.<br>

An activity that introduces the theme for the day.<br>
mission briefing<br>
10 minutes<br>
A simple Bible study that gives the biblical foundation for the theme done in groups of two or three. It will be<br>
helpful for leaders to circulate around the room to listen in on conversations to see that participants are going in<br>
the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
thinking it through<br>
5 minutes<br>
A personal reflection time where each participant writes down what they have personally learned from the Bible<br>
study and how this applies to their own life as an Ambassador. To be shared briefly with their spiritual companion<br>
who will be a spiritual encourager during the curriculum.<br>
reflecting Jesus &amp;<br>
His kingdom<br>
40 minutes<br>
An activity that expands on the main theme for the lesson. This section is called “reflecting Jesus and His kingdom”<br>
because an Ambassador’s main task is to represent who Jesus is to others, as well as what the kingdom of heaven<br>
stands for.<br>
next steps<br>
15 minutes<br>
An Ambassador for Jesus will grow spiritually and will witnesses in everyday life beyond the training sessions.<br>
Therefore, each participant will develop an individual discipleship plan that will help them grow as an Ambassador<br>
for Jesus when they are outside of the learning environment.<br>
At the beginning of each module in the curriculum, participants will develop an individual discipleship plan (IDP)<br>
that will guide their personal spiritual journey during that section. Each IDP will focus on the theme of that section.<br>
“Next Steps” is a time for participants to reflect on how their IDP is working and to pray for each other in what they<br>
aim to do next. This will be done with their spiritual companion. A spiritual companion is a friend who prays for and<br>
encourages their own companion over a set period of time.<br>
summary<br>
5 minutes<br>
As a whole group, this is an opportunity to summarize what participants have learned during the session. It is a time<br>
for the leader to generally review what has been done and to ask for volunteers to briefly share what they have<br>
learned.<br>
basic template for teaching sessions<br>
This template will be used during most in-house teaching sessions. There will be variations in the format<br>

God has called me to be His Ambassador<br>
“So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making His appeal through us.<br>
We speak for Christ when we plead, ‘Come back to God!’”<br>
2 Corinthians 5:20, NLT<br>
An Ambassador is a diplomatic agent of the highest rank<br>
accredited to a foreign government or sovereign as the<br>
resident representative of his own government<br>
or sovereign or appointed for a special<br>
and often temporary diplomatic assignment<br>
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition<br>
24 1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
mission briefing<br>
The Bible is God’s book to show His Ambassadors how to live on earth while representing His kingdom in heaven. It explains who God is,<br>
who we are, and where we are going. At the heart of this book is the revelation of Jesus, and that only through His Holy Spirit can His<br>
Ambassadors make an eternal impact in the world. Before sin, we would have known how to live without having it written down because<br>
God’s laws and principles would have been written on our hearts and minds. But while we live with very forgetful memories, God has chosen<br>
to write everything down for us.<br>
1. As Ambassadors we use words to encourage people to turn to Jesus. But who we are—our characters—demonstrate the truth and<br>
power of our words. In other words, who we are makes our words believable. In Ezekiel 36:23-26, God promises to reveal His holiness to<br>
the nations “through” His people. In these verses, what is the most important thing that will enable you to reveal to others the truth<br>
about God?<br>
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
2. Ellen White wrote that character is defined as our “thoughts and feelings combined.” From Matthew 5:1-12, what do you think are the<br>
thoughts and feelings that will shape an ambassador’s mind and heart as they live out these qualities of the kingdom of God on earth?<br>

                                       <strong>Welcome to Ambassadors</strong><br>
                                       <br>
Ambassadors is a new level of youth ministry designed to equip leaders with resources to train a new generation of youths to be the hands, feet, and voice of Jesus in their local churches and communities.<br>
                                       <br>
An ambassador generally represents a country or a cause. A Christian ambassador is a representative of another kind; they represent the values, principles, culture, and laws of the kingdom of God. They stand for the character and purpose of the King of this kingdom—Jesus Christ, Himself.<br>
                                       <br>
This Youth Department resource is based on seven foundations that are considered as essential to meet the developmental needs of our young people between the ages of 16-21. <br>
                                       <br>
They include:<br>
                                       <br>
1. A Christ-centered discipleship plan<br>
2. Leadership development<br>
3. A personal, public, and small group based mission lifestyle<br>
4. Character and personality development, including outdoor, high adventure programming<br>
5. Lifestyle and vocational training<br>
6. Nurturing godly relationships<br>
7. Community outreach development through service projects and emergency preparedness training<br>
                                       <br>
Each of these seven foundations will be presented in modules, with participants gaining certification for each module completed. While<br>
each module has a specific focus, there are FOUR elements that will be common throughout the curriculum. Leaders MUST ensure that all these elements are embraced to make the experience meaningful, attractive, and challenging.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>1. First - The concept of a spiritual companion</strong><br>
At the beginning of each module, each participant will choose a friend who will be their companion for the duration of the module. They will meet during each session to encourage and support each other in their role and growth as an Ambassador. Groups of spiritual companions will also come together for specific activities. This builds the concept of interdependence and accountability into the Ambassador experience.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>2. Second - An Individual Discipleship Plan (IDP)</strong><br>
At the beginning of every module, each participant will make a simple plan of how they would like to grow spiritually and acquire practical competency in the area of the upcoming module. Their spiritual companion will be there throughout the module to help and encourage them to accomplish their plan. The IDP helps to emphasize the continuing nature of discipleship and that learning is a continual part of life. By linking spiritual companions together for this work, it stresses the need for interdependence on each other as we learn, grow, and work for God.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>3. Third - Projects<br>
                                       </strong>Each module will have a project that will integrate the core concepts from the module into a service learning activity focused on helping others. This will be an opportunity for the Ambassador class to work together as a whole. You will find INSTRUCTIONS for setting up your project in the back pages of this Leader’s Guide. You might have to plan for multiple projects, depending on the size of your group.<br>
                                       <br>
• The main objective is to incorporate service as a way of life, rather than an occasional activity.<br>
• Aim for projects that would call for regular involvement over a period of time.<br>
• Make contact with your Volunteer Service organizations, the local Council, and other entities that could assist you.<br>
• If your group settles on a particular medium/long term project, there is no need to change the project when the time comes to engage with a new module. Use your discretion.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>4. Fourth - Social Activities </strong><br>
Ensure that you plan for a social activity at least once a month. Make sure that you always provide opportunities for good and wholesome fun for that age group.<br>
• You do not have to conduct all your sessions in a building. As appropriate, conduct some in nature, in the context of a camp, in<br>
someone’s home, etc.<br>
• In the back pages of your Leader’s Guide you will find a list of websites where you can access ‘Ice Breakers’ or brief fun activities that you can inject into all your sessions.<br>
                                       <br>
Of course, CONDUCT ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES PRAYERFULLY.<br>
RECOMMENDATION<br>
                                       <br>
It is highly recommended that you set aside your first meeting as a fun ORIENTATION to share the Ambassadors concept, share the Participant’s Guides, give an overview of the first module, discuss the FOUR elements and their implementation, discuss the frequency of meetings, organize calendars, etc.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <em>Participant’s Guide</em><br>
A participant’s guide for each module has been prepared for each participant.<br>
• The Participant’s Guide is essentially the workbook containing all the sessions of each module that the participant will engage with.<br>
• In the back pages of each module there is a page for creating the IDP. There is also a list of the sessions for that module that the leader will date and sign upon the participant’s completion.<br>
• Each participant will be required to complete 75 percent attendance and participation to receive the certification or award at the end of each module. Participants can make-up for missed lessons to achieve the required 75 percent at the discretion of their leader.<br>
                                       <br>
Fostering togetherness is at the heart of a model for discipleship, which the General Conference is focusing on; it is known as “Together<br>
Growing Fruitful Disciples.” This model emphasizes understanding, connecting, equipping, and ministering—but doing all of this<br>
“together.” For God did not design us to grow or minister alone, but in community. Paul writes that growing in Christ is achieved as<br>
everyone uses the gifts God has given to them, “until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become<br>
mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13).<br>
                                       <br>
Thank you for helping to educate our young people to become Ambassadors of Jesus Christ and His kingdom.<br>

1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
As a human being with a nature that naturally tends to move away from God, growing to reflect Jesus as an Ambassador will rarely happen by chance or without much thought. That’s why for each of the Ambassador’s modules, you will be creating your own IDP. The focus of each IDP will relate to the theme of your current module and last for the duration of that module. Here is an example of what an IDP will look like. Fill in your own IDP on the form provided.<br>
                                       <br>
1. IDP Module Name:<br>
CHRIST-CENTERED DISCIPLESHIP<br>
                                       <br>
2. Spiritual Companion: Who is the spiritual companion who will encourage and support you in the next stage of your spiritual journey of<br>
growing as an Ambassador of Jesus? They will remain your spiritual companion throughout the current module. JOHN WILCOX (Your choice of spiritual companion is added in session Leave blank for now.)<br>
                                       <br>
3. Personal vision statement: This includes two parts: <br>
(a) What do you see in your life today that you would like to change in order to become more effective as an Ambassador for Jesus? <br>
(b) Describe how you would like to see yourself in the future. Before you start writing, take a moment to pray for God to guide your thoughts.<br>
                                       <br>
• CURRENTLY, I DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR OR VERY MEANINGFUL DEVOTIONAL LIFE.<br>
• I WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP A DEVOTIONAL LIFE THAT CAN EQUIP ME SPIRITUALLY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR FOR JESUS.<br>
                                       <br>
4. Expected evidence of change: After looking at your personal vision statement, list the evidence you might expect to see that reveals you are<br>
growing in Christ.<br>
• I THINK AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR IS SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS PRAYING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO REVEAL THE CHARACTER OF JESUS<br>
WHEREVER THEY GO. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR MY LIFE.<br>
                                       <br>
5. Next steps: List the practical steps you will take to accomplish your personal discipleship vision. Think about how these steps will also<br>
shape your daily devotions with God.<br>
• SET MY ALARM CLOCK FOR 7AM TO START MY DEVOTIONS<br>
• SPEND 30 MINUTES IN PRAYER AND BIBLE READING<br>
• REPEAT BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP<br>
• FIND A BOOK TO READ THAT TEACHES DIFFERENT WAYS TO STUDY THE BIBLE<br>
• PRAY EACH DAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME AS HIS AMBASSADOR<br>
                                       <br>
6. Reflection: How did I do? This is completed at the end of the module. It gives you a chance to reflect on what worked well and what you<br>
would like to improve in the future. You can compare your expected evidences of change to what actually happened.<br>
                                       <br>
• I REALLY ENJOYED THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. THE MORE I READ AND UNDERSTOOD, THE MORE CONFIDENT I BECAME TO PRAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME. I THINK I WILL EXPAND THE TIME FOR DEVOTIONS I HAVE IN THE EVENING, AND NOW THAT I HAVE READ A BOOK ON BIBLE STUDY, I WOULD LIKE TO READ ANOTHER ON INTERCESSORY PRAYER. I HAVE FOUND THAT I REALLY ENJOY PRAYING FOR OTHERS.<br>

1. General welcome and opening prayer.<br>
2. A short getting-to-know you activity. As friendships continually deepen, so the ability to encourage and<br>

13 minutes<br>
An activity that introduces the theme for the day.<br>
mission briefing<br>
10 minutes<br>
A simple Bible study that gives the biblical foundation for the theme done in groups of two or three. It will be<br>
helpful for leaders to circulate around the room to listen in on conversations to see that participants are going in<br>
the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
thinking it through<br>
5 minutes<br>
A personal reflection time where each participant writes down what they have personally learned from the Bible<br>
study and how this applies to their own life as an Ambassador. To be shared briefly with their spiritual companion<br>
who will be a spiritual encourager during the curriculum.<br>
reflecting Jesus &amp;<br>
His kingdom<br>
40 minutes<br>
An activity that expands on the main theme for the lesson. This section is called “reflecting Jesus and His kingdom”<br>
because an Ambassador’s main task is to represent who Jesus is to others, as well as what the kingdom of heaven<br>
stands for.<br>
next steps<br>
15 minutes<br>
An Ambassador for Jesus will grow spiritually and will witnesses in everyday life beyond the training sessions.<br>
Therefore, each participant will develop an individual discipleship plan that will help them grow as an Ambassador<br>
for Jesus when they are outside of the learning environment.<br>
At the beginning of each module in the curriculum, participants will develop an individual discipleship plan (IDP)<br>
that will guide their personal spiritual journey during that section. Each IDP will focus on the theme of that section.<br>
“Next Steps” is a time for participants to reflect on how their IDP is working and to pray for each other in what they<br>
aim to do next. This will be done with their spiritual companion. A spiritual companion is a friend who prays for and<br>
encourages their own companion over a set period of time.<br>
summary<br>
5 minutes<br>
As a whole group, this is an opportunity to summarize what participants have learned during the session. It is a time<br>
for the leader to generally review what has been done and to ask for volunteers to briefly share what they have<br>
learned.<br>
basic template for teaching sessions<br>
This template will be used during most in-house teaching sessions. There will be variations in the format<br>
depending on the focus for the day.<br>

2 Corinthians 5:20, NLT<br>
An Ambassador is a diplomatic agent of the highest rank<br>
accredited to a foreign government or sovereign as the<br>
resident representative of his own government<br>
or sovereign or appointed for a special<br>
and often temporary diplomatic assignment<br>
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition<br>
24 1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
mission briefing<br>
The Bible is God’s book to show His Ambassadors how to live on earth while representing His kingdom in heaven. It explains who God is,<br>
who we are, and where we are going. At the heart of this book is the revelation of Jesus, and that only through His Holy Spirit can His<br>
Ambassadors make an eternal impact in the world. Before sin, we would have known how to live without having it written down because<br>
God’s laws and principles would have been written on our hearts and minds. But while we live with very forgetful memories, God has chosen<br>
to write everything down for us.<br>
1. As Ambassadors we use words to encourage people to turn to Jesus. But who we are—our characters—demonstrate the truth and<br>
power of our words. In other words, who we are makes our words believable. In Ezekiel 36:23-26, God promises to reveal His holiness to<br>
the nations “through” His people. In these verses, what is the most important thing that will enable you to reveal to others the truth<br>
about God?<br>
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
2. Ellen White wrote that character is defined as our “thoughts and feelings combined.” From Matthew 5:1-12, what do you think are the<br>
thoughts and feelings that will shape an ambassador’s mind and heart as they live out these qualities of the kingdom of God on earth?<br>

                                       <strong>Welcome to Ambassadors</strong><br>
                                       <br>
Ambassadors is a new level of youth ministry designed to equip leaders with resources to train a new generation of youths to be the hands, feet, and voice of Jesus in their local churches and communities.<br>
                                       <br>
An ambassador generally represents a country or a cause. A Christian ambassador is a representative of another kind; they represent the values, principles, culture, and laws of the kingdom of God. They stand for the character and purpose of the King of this kingdom—Jesus Christ, Himself.<br>
                                       <br>
This Youth Department resource is based on seven foundations that are considered as essential to meet the developmental needs of our young people between the ages of 16-21. <br>
                                       <br>
They include:<br>
                                       <br>
1. A Christ-centered discipleship plan<br>
2. Leadership development<br>
3. A personal, public, and small group based mission lifestyle<br>
4. Character and personality development, including outdoor, high adventure programming<br>
5. Lifestyle and vocational training<br>
6. Nurturing godly relationships<br>
7. Community outreach development through service projects and emergency preparedness training<br>
                                       <br>
Each of these seven foundations will be presented in modules, with participants gaining certification for each module completed. While<br>
each module has a specific focus, there are FOUR elements that will be common throughout the curriculum. Leaders MUST ensure that all these elements are embraced to make the experience meaningful, attractive, and challenging.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>1. First - The concept of a spiritual companion</strong><br>
At the beginning of each module, each participant will choose a friend who will be their companion for the duration of the module. They will meet during each session to encourage and support each other in their role and growth as an Ambassador. Groups of spiritual companions will also come together for specific activities. This builds the concept of interdependence and accountability into the Ambassador experience.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>2. Second - An Individual Discipleship Plan (IDP)</strong><br>
At the beginning of every module, each participant will make a simple plan of how they would like to grow spiritually and acquire practical competency in the area of the upcoming module. Their spiritual companion will be there throughout the module to help and encourage them to accomplish their plan. The IDP helps to emphasize the continuing nature of discipleship and that learning is a continual part of life. By linking spiritual companions together for this work, it stresses the need for interdependence on each other as we learn, grow, and work for God.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>3. Third - Projects<br>
                                       </strong>Each module will have a project that will integrate the core concepts from the module into a service learning activity focused on helping others. This will be an opportunity for the Ambassador class to work together as a whole. You will find INSTRUCTIONS for setting up your project in the back pages of this Leader’s Guide. You might have to plan for multiple projects, depending on the size of your group.<br>
                                       <br>
• The main objective is to incorporate service as a way of life, rather than an occasional activity.<br>
• Aim for projects that would call for regular involvement over a period of time.<br>
• Make contact with your Volunteer Service organizations, the local Council, and other entities that could assist you.<br>
• If your group settles on a particular medium/long term project, there is no need to change the project when the time comes to engage with a new module. Use your discretion.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>4. Fourth - Social Activities </strong><br>
Ensure that you plan for a social activity at least once a month. Make sure that you always provide opportunities for good and wholesome fun for that age group.<br>
• You do not have to conduct all your sessions in a building. As appropriate, conduct some in nature, in the context of a camp, in<br>
someone’s home, etc.<br>
• In the back pages of your Leader’s Guide you will find a list of websites where you can access ‘Ice Breakers’ or brief fun activities that you can inject into all your sessions.<br>
                                       <br>
Of course, CONDUCT ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES PRAYERFULLY.<br>
RECOMMENDATION<br>
                                       <br>
It is highly recommended that you set aside your first meeting as a fun ORIENTATION to share the Ambassadors concept, share the Participant’s Guides, give an overview of the first module, discuss the FOUR elements and their implementation, discuss the frequency of meetings, organize calendars, etc.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <em>Participant’s Guide</em><br>
A participant’s guide for each module has been prepared for each participant.<br>
• The Participant’s Guide is essentially the workbook containing all the sessions of each module that the participant will engage with.<br>
• In the back pages of each module there is a page for creating the IDP. There is also a list of the sessions for that module that the leader will date and sign upon the participant’s completion.<br>
• Each participant will be required to complete 75 percent attendance and participation to receive the certification or award at the end of each module. Participants can make-up for missed lessons to achieve the required 75 percent at the discretion of their leader.<br>
                                       <br>
Fostering togetherness is at the heart of a model for discipleship, which the General Conference is focusing on; it is known as “Together<br>
Growing Fruitful Disciples.” This model emphasizes understanding, connecting, equipping, and ministering—but doing all of this<br>
“together.” For God did not design us to grow or minister alone, but in community. Paul writes that growing in Christ is achieved as<br>
everyone uses the gifts God has given to them, “until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become<br>
mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13).<br>
                                       <br>
Thank you for helping to educate our young people to become Ambassadors of Jesus Christ and His kingdom.<br>

1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
As a human being with a nature that naturally tends to move away from God, growing to reflect Jesus as an Ambassador will rarely happen by chance or without much thought. That’s why for each of the Ambassador’s modules, you will be creating your own IDP. The focus of each IDP will relate to the theme of your current module and last for the duration of that module. Here is an example of what an IDP will look like. Fill in your own IDP on the form provided.<br>
                                       <br>
1. IDP Module Name:<br>
CHRIST-CENTERED DISCIPLESHIP<br>
                                       <br>
2. Spiritual Companion: Who is the spiritual companion who will encourage and support you in the next stage of your spiritual journey of<br>
growing as an Ambassador of Jesus? They will remain your spiritual companion throughout the current module. JOHN WILCOX (Your choice of spiritual companion is added in session Leave blank for now.)<br>
                                       <br>
3. Personal vision statement: This includes two parts: <br>
(a) What do you see in your life today that you would like to change in order to become more effective as an Ambassador for Jesus? <br>
(b) Describe how you would like to see yourself in the future. Before you start writing, take a moment to pray for God to guide your thoughts.<br>
                                       <br>
• CURRENTLY, I DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR OR VERY MEANINGFUL DEVOTIONAL LIFE.<br>
• I WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP A DEVOTIONAL LIFE THAT CAN EQUIP ME SPIRITUALLY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR FOR JESUS.<br>
                                       <br>
4. Expected evidence of change: After looking at your personal vision statement, list the evidence you might expect to see that reveals you are<br>
growing in Christ.<br>
• I THINK AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR IS SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS PRAYING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO REVEAL THE CHARACTER OF JESUS<br>
WHEREVER THEY GO. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR MY LIFE.<br>
                                       <br>
5. Next steps: List the practical steps you will take to accomplish your personal discipleship vision. Think about how these steps will also<br>
shape your daily devotions with God.<br>
• SET MY ALARM CLOCK FOR 7AM TO START MY DEVOTIONS<br>
• SPEND 30 MINUTES IN PRAYER AND BIBLE READING<br>
• REPEAT BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP<br>
• FIND A BOOK TO READ THAT TEACHES DIFFERENT WAYS TO STUDY THE BIBLE<br>
• PRAY EACH DAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME AS HIS AMBASSADOR<br>
                                       <br>
6. Reflection: How did I do? This is completed at the end of the module. It gives you a chance to reflect on what worked well and what you<br>
would like to improve in the future. You can compare your expected evidences of change to what actually happened.<br>
                                       <br>
• I REALLY ENJOYED THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. THE MORE I READ AND UNDERSTOOD, THE MORE CONFIDENT I BECAME TO PRAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME. I THINK I WILL EXPAND THE TIME FOR DEVOTIONS I HAVE IN THE EVENING, AND NOW THAT I HAVE READ A BOOK ON BIBLE STUDY, I WOULD LIKE TO READ ANOTHER ON INTERCESSORY PRAYER. I HAVE FOUND THAT I REALLY ENJOY PRAYING FOR OTHERS.<br>
                                       <br>

An activity that introduces the theme for the day.<br>
mission briefing<br>
10 minutes<br>
A simple Bible study that gives the biblical foundation for the theme done in groups of two or three. It will be<br>
helpful for leaders to circulate around the room to listen in on conversations to see that participants are going in<br>
the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
thinking it through<br>
5 minutes<br>
A personal reflection time where each participant writes down what they have personally learned from the Bible<br>
study and how this applies to their own life as an Ambassador. To be shared briefly with their spiritual companion<br>
who will be a spiritual encourager during the curriculum.<br>
reflecting Jesus &amp;<br>
His kingdom<br>
40 minutes<br>
An activity that expands on the main theme for the lesson. This section is called “reflecting Jesus and His kingdom”<br>
because an Ambassador’s main task is to represent who Jesus is to others, as well as what the kingdom of heaven<br>
stands for.<br>
next steps<br>
15 minutes<br>
An Ambassador for Jesus will grow spiritually and will witnesses in everyday life beyond the training sessions.<br>
Therefore, each participant will develop an individual discipleship plan that will help them grow as an Ambassador<br>
for Jesus when they are outside of the learning environment.<br>
At the beginning of each module in the curriculum, participants will develop an individual discipleship plan (IDP)<br>
that will guide their personal spiritual journey during that section. Each IDP will focus on the theme of that section.<br>
“Next Steps” is a time for participants to reflect on how their IDP is working and to pray for each other in what they<br>
aim to do next. This will be done with their spiritual companion. A spiritual companion is a friend who prays for and<br>
encourages their own companion over a set period of time.<br>
summary<br>
5 minutes<br>
As a whole group, this is an opportunity to summarize what participants have learned during the session. It is a time<br>
for the leader to generally review what has been done and to ask for volunteers to briefly share what they have<br>
learned.<br>
basic template for teaching sessions<br>
This template will be used during most in-house teaching sessions. There will be variations in the format<br>
depending on the focus for the day.<br>

An Ambassador is a diplomatic agent of the highest rank<br>
accredited to a foreign government or sovereign as the<br>
resident representative of his own government<br>
or sovereign or appointed for a special<br>
and often temporary diplomatic assignment<br>
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition<br>
24 1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
mission briefing<br>
The Bible is God’s book to show His Ambassadors how to live on earth while representing His kingdom in heaven. It explains who God is,<br>
who we are, and where we are going. At the heart of this book is the revelation of Jesus, and that only through His Holy Spirit can His<br>
Ambassadors make an eternal impact in the world. Before sin, we would have known how to live without having it written down because<br>
God’s laws and principles would have been written on our hearts and minds. But while we live with very forgetful memories, God has chosen<br>
to write everything down for us.<br>
1. As Ambassadors we use words to encourage people to turn to Jesus. But who we are—our characters—demonstrate the truth and<br>
power of our words. In other words, who we are makes our words believable. In Ezekiel 36:23-26, God promises to reveal His holiness to<br>
the nations “through” His people. In these verses, what is the most important thing that will enable you to reveal to others the truth<br>
about God?<br>
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
2. Ellen White wrote that character is defined as our “thoughts and feelings combined.” From Matthew 5:1-12, what do you think are the<br>
thoughts and feelings that will shape an ambassador’s mind and heart as they live out these qualities of the kingdom of God on earth?<br>

                                       <strong>Welcome to Ambassadors</strong><br>
                                       <br>
Ambassadors is a new level of youth ministry designed to equip leaders with resources to train a new generation of youths to be the hands, feet, and voice of Jesus in their local churches and communities.<br>
                                       <br>
An ambassador generally represents a country or a cause. A Christian ambassador is a representative of another kind; they represent the values, principles, culture, and laws of the kingdom of God. They stand for the character and purpose of the King of this kingdom—Jesus Christ, Himself.<br>
                                       <br>
This Youth Department resource is based on seven foundations that are considered as essential to meet the developmental needs of our young people between the ages of 16-21. <br>
                                       <br>
They include:<br>
                                       <br>
1. A Christ-centered discipleship plan<br>
2. Leadership development<br>
3. A personal, public, and small group based mission lifestyle<br>
4. Character and personality development, including outdoor, high adventure programming<br>
5. Lifestyle and vocational training<br>
6. Nurturing godly relationships<br>
7. Community outreach development through service projects and emergency preparedness training<br>
                                       <br>
Each of these seven foundations will be presented in modules, with participants gaining certification for each module completed. While<br>
each module has a specific focus, there are FOUR elements that will be common throughout the curriculum. Leaders MUST ensure that all these elements are embraced to make the experience meaningful, attractive, and challenging.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>1. First - The concept of a spiritual companion</strong><br>
At the beginning of each module, each participant will choose a friend who will be their companion for the duration of the module. They will meet during each session to encourage and support each other in their role and growth as an Ambassador. Groups of spiritual companions will also come together for specific activities. This builds the concept of interdependence and accountability into the Ambassador experience.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>2. Second - An Individual Discipleship Plan (IDP)</strong><br>
At the beginning of every module, each participant will make a simple plan of how they would like to grow spiritually and acquire practical competency in the area of the upcoming module. Their spiritual companion will be there throughout the module to help and encourage them to accomplish their plan. The IDP helps to emphasize the continuing nature of discipleship and that learning is a continual part of life. By linking spiritual companions together for this work, it stresses the need for interdependence on each other as we learn, grow, and work for God.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>3. Third - Projects<br>
                                       </strong>Each module will have a project that will integrate the core concepts from the module into a service learning activity focused on helping others. This will be an opportunity for the Ambassador class to work together as a whole. You will find INSTRUCTIONS for setting up your project in the back pages of this Leader’s Guide. You might have to plan for multiple projects, depending on the size of your group.<br>
                                       <br>
• The main objective is to incorporate service as a way of life, rather than an occasional activity.<br>
• Aim for projects that would call for regular involvement over a period of time.<br>
• Make contact with your Volunteer Service organizations, the local Council, and other entities that could assist you.<br>
• If your group settles on a particular medium/long term project, there is no need to change the project when the time comes to engage with a new module. Use your discretion.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>4. Fourth - Social Activities </strong><br>
Ensure that you plan for a social activity at least once a month. Make sure that you always provide opportunities for good and wholesome fun for that age group.<br>
• You do not have to conduct all your sessions in a building. As appropriate, conduct some in nature, in the context of a camp, in<br>
someone’s home, etc.<br>
• In the back pages of your Leader’s Guide you will find a list of websites where you can access ‘Ice Breakers’ or brief fun activities that you can inject into all your sessions.<br>
                                       <br>
Of course, CONDUCT ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES PRAYERFULLY.<br>
RECOMMENDATION<br>
                                       <br>
It is highly recommended that you set aside your first meeting as a fun ORIENTATION to share the Ambassadors concept, share the Participant’s Guides, give an overview of the first module, discuss the FOUR elements and their implementation, discuss the frequency of meetings, organize calendars, etc.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <em>Participant’s Guide</em><br>
A participant’s guide for each module has been prepared for each participant.<br>
• The Participant’s Guide is essentially the workbook containing all the sessions of each module that the participant will engage with.<br>
• In the back pages of each module there is a page for creating the IDP. There is also a list of the sessions for that module that the leader will date and sign upon the participant’s completion.<br>
• Each participant will be required to complete 75 percent attendance and participation to receive the certification or award at the end of each module. Participants can make-up for missed lessons to achieve the required 75 percent at the discretion of their leader.<br>
                                       <br>
Fostering togetherness is at the heart of a model for discipleship, which the General Conference is focusing on; it is known as “Together<br>
Growing Fruitful Disciples.” This model emphasizes understanding, connecting, equipping, and ministering—but doing all of this<br>
“together.” For God did not design us to grow or minister alone, but in community. Paul writes that growing in Christ is achieved as<br>
everyone uses the gifts God has given to them, “until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become<br>
mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13).<br>
                                       <br>
Thank you for helping to educate our young people to become Ambassadors of Jesus Christ and His kingdom.<br>

1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
As a human being with a nature that naturally tends to move away from God, growing to reflect Jesus as an Ambassador will rarely happen by chance or without much thought. That’s why for each of the Ambassador’s modules, you will be creating your own IDP. The focus of each IDP will relate to the theme of your current module and last for the duration of that module. Here is an example of what an IDP will look like. Fill in your own IDP on the form provided.<br>
                                       <br>
1. IDP Module Name:<br>
CHRIST-CENTERED DISCIPLESHIP<br>
                                       <br>
2. Spiritual Companion: Who is the spiritual companion who will encourage and support you in the next stage of your spiritual journey of<br>
growing as an Ambassador of Jesus? They will remain your spiritual companion throughout the current module. JOHN WILCOX (Your choice of spiritual companion is added in session Leave blank for now.)<br>
                                       <br>
3. Personal vision statement: This includes two parts: <br>
(a) What do you see in your life today that you would like to change in order to become more effective as an Ambassador for Jesus? <br>
(b) Describe how you would like to see yourself in the future. Before you start writing, take a moment to pray for God to guide your thoughts.<br>
                                       <br>
• CURRENTLY, I DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR OR VERY MEANINGFUL DEVOTIONAL LIFE.<br>
• I WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP A DEVOTIONAL LIFE THAT CAN EQUIP ME SPIRITUALLY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR FOR JESUS.<br>
                                       <br>
4. Expected evidence of change: After looking at your personal vision statement, list the evidence you might expect to see that reveals you are<br>
growing in Christ.<br>
• I THINK AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR IS SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS PRAYING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO REVEAL THE CHARACTER OF JESUS<br>
WHEREVER THEY GO. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR MY LIFE.<br>
                                       <br>
5. Next steps: List the practical steps you will take to accomplish your personal discipleship vision. Think about how these steps will also<br>
shape your daily devotions with God.<br>
• SET MY ALARM CLOCK FOR 7AM TO START MY DEVOTIONS<br>
• SPEND 30 MINUTES IN PRAYER AND BIBLE READING<br>
• REPEAT BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP<br>
• FIND A BOOK TO READ THAT TEACHES DIFFERENT WAYS TO STUDY THE BIBLE<br>
• PRAY EACH DAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME AS HIS AMBASSADOR<br>
                                       <br>
6. Reflection: How did I do? This is completed at the end of the module. It gives you a chance to reflect on what worked well and what you<br>
would like to improve in the future. You can compare your expected evidences of change to what actually happened.<br>
                                       <br>
• I REALLY ENJOYED THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. THE MORE I READ AND UNDERSTOOD, THE MORE CONFIDENT I BECAME TO PRAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME. I THINK I WILL EXPAND THE TIME FOR DEVOTIONS I HAVE IN THE EVENING, AND NOW THAT I HAVE READ A BOOK ON BIBLE STUDY, I WOULD LIKE TO READ ANOTHER ON INTERCESSORY PRAYER. I HAVE FOUND THAT I REALLY ENJOY PRAYING FOR OTHERS.<br>
                                       <br>

An activity that introduces the theme for the day.<br>
mission briefing<br>
10 minutes<br>
A simple Bible study that gives the biblical foundation for the theme done in groups of two or three. It will be<br>
helpful for leaders to circulate around the room to listen in on conversations to see that participants are going in<br>
the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
thinking it through<br>
5 minutes<br>
A personal reflection time where each participant writes down what they have personally learned from the Bible<br>
study and how this applies to their own life as an Ambassador. To be shared briefly with their spiritual companion<br>
who will be a spiritual encourager during the curriculum.<br>
reflecting Jesus &amp;<br>
His kingdom<br>
40 minutes<br>
An activity that expands on the main theme for the lesson. This section is called “reflecting Jesus and His kingdom”<br>
because an Ambassador’s main task is to represent who Jesus is to others, as well as what the kingdom of heaven<br>
stands for.<br>
next steps<br>
15 minutes<br>
An Ambassador for Jesus will grow spiritually and will witnesses in everyday life beyond the training sessions.<br>
Therefore, each participant will develop an individual discipleship plan that will help them grow as an Ambassador<br>
for Jesus when they are outside of the learning environment.<br>
At the beginning of each module in the curriculum, participants will develop an individual discipleship plan (IDP)<br>
that will guide their personal spiritual journey during that section. Each IDP will focus on the theme of that section.<br>
“Next Steps” is a time for participants to reflect on how their IDP is working and to pray for each other in what they<br>
aim to do next. This will be done with their spiritual companion. A spiritual companion is a friend who prays for and<br>
encourages their own companion over a set period of time.<br>
summary<br>
5 minutes<br>
As a whole group, this is an opportunity to summarize what participants have learned during the session. It is a time<br>
for the leader to generally review what has been done and to ask for volunteers to briefly share what they have<br>
learned.<br>
basic template for teaching sessions<br>
This template will be used during most in-house teaching sessions. There will be variations in the format<br>
depending on the focus for the day.<br>

God has called me to be His Ambassador<br>
“So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making His appeal through us.<br>

2 Corinthians 5:20, NLT<br>
An Ambassador is a diplomatic agent of the highest rank<br>
accredited to a foreign government or sovereign as the<br>
resident representative of his own government<br>
or sovereign or appointed for a special<br>
and often temporary diplomatic assignment<br>

24 1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
mission briefing<br>
The Bible is God’s book to show His Ambassadors how to live on earth while representing His kingdom in heaven. It explains who God is,<br>
who we are, and where we are going. At the heart of this book is the revelation of Jesus, and that only through His Holy Spirit can His<br>
Ambassadors make an eternal impact in the world. Before sin, we would have known how to live without having it written down because<br>
God’s laws and principles would have been written on our hearts and minds. But while we live with very forgetful memories, God has chosen<br>
to write everything down for us.<br>
1. As Ambassadors we use words to encourage people to turn to Jesus. But who we are—our characters—demonstrate the truth and<br>
power of our words. In other words, who we are makes our words believable. In Ezekiel 36:23-26, God promises to reveal His holiness to<br>
the nations “through” His people. In these verses, what is the most important thing that will enable you to reveal to others the truth<br>
about God?<br>
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
2. Ellen White wrote that character is defined as our “thoughts and feelings combined.” From Matthew 5:1-12, what do you think are the<br>
thoughts and feelings that will shape an ambassador’s mind and heart as they live out these qualities of the kingdom of God on earth?<br>

                                       <strong>Welcome to Ambassadors</strong><br>
                                       <br>
Ambassadors is a new level of youth ministry designed to equip leaders with resources to train a new generation of youths to be the hands, feet, and voice of Jesus in their local churches and communities.<br>
                                       <br>
An ambassador generally represents a country or a cause. A Christian ambassador is a representative of another kind; they represent the values, principles, culture, and laws of the kingdom of God. They stand for the character and purpose of the King of this kingdom—Jesus Christ, Himself.<br>
                                       <br>
This Youth Department resource is based on seven foundations that are considered as essential to meet the developmental needs of our young people between the ages of 16-21. <br>
                                       <br>
They include:<br>
                                       <br>
1. A Christ-centered discipleship plan<br>
2. Leadership development<br>
3. A personal, public, and small group based mission lifestyle<br>
4. Character and personality development, including outdoor, high adventure programming<br>
5. Lifestyle and vocational training<br>
6. Nurturing godly relationships<br>
7. Community outreach development through service projects and emergency preparedness training<br>
                                       <br>
Each of these seven foundations will be presented in modules, with participants gaining certification for each module completed. While<br>
each module has a specific focus, there are FOUR elements that will be common throughout the curriculum. Leaders MUST ensure that all these elements are embraced to make the experience meaningful, attractive, and challenging.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>1. First - The concept of a spiritual companion</strong><br>
At the beginning of each module, each participant will choose a friend who will be their companion for the duration of the module. They will meet during each session to encourage and support each other in their role and growth as an Ambassador. Groups of spiritual companions will also come together for specific activities. This builds the concept of interdependence and accountability into the Ambassador experience.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>2. Second - An Individual Discipleship Plan (IDP)</strong><br>
At the beginning of every module, each participant will make a simple plan of how they would like to grow spiritually and acquire practical competency in the area of the upcoming module. Their spiritual companion will be there throughout the module to help and encourage them to accomplish their plan. The IDP helps to emphasize the continuing nature of discipleship and that learning is a continual part of life. By linking spiritual companions together for this work, it stresses the need for interdependence on each other as we learn, grow, and work for God.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>3. Third - Projects<br>
                                       </strong>Each module will have a project that will integrate the core concepts from the module into a service learning activity focused on helping others. This will be an opportunity for the Ambassador class to work together as a whole. You will find INSTRUCTIONS for setting up your project in the back pages of this Leader’s Guide. You might have to plan for multiple projects, depending on the size of your group.<br>
                                       <br>
• The main objective is to incorporate service as a way of life, rather than an occasional activity.<br>
• Aim for projects that would call for regular involvement over a period of time.<br>
• Make contact with your Volunteer Service organizations, the local Council, and other entities that could assist you.<br>
• If your group settles on a particular medium/long term project, there is no need to change the project when the time comes to engage with a new module. Use your discretion.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>4. Fourth - Social Activities </strong><br>
Ensure that you plan for a social activity at least once a month. Make sure that you always provide opportunities for good and wholesome fun for that age group.<br>
• You do not have to conduct all your sessions in a building. As appropriate, conduct some in nature, in the context of a camp, in<br>
someone’s home, etc.<br>
• In the back pages of your Leader’s Guide you will find a list of websites where you can access ‘Ice Breakers’ or brief fun activities that you can inject into all your sessions.<br>
                                       <br>
Of course, CONDUCT ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES PRAYERFULLY.<br>
RECOMMENDATION<br>
                                       <br>
It is highly recommended that you set aside your first meeting as a fun ORIENTATION to share the Ambassadors concept, share the Participant’s Guides, give an overview of the first module, discuss the FOUR elements and their implementation, discuss the frequency of meetings, organize calendars, etc.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <em>Participant’s Guide</em><br>
A participant’s guide for each module has been prepared for each participant.<br>
• The Participant’s Guide is essentially the workbook containing all the sessions of each module that the participant will engage with.<br>
• In the back pages of each module there is a page for creating the IDP. There is also a list of the sessions for that module that the leader will date and sign upon the participant’s completion.<br>
• Each participant will be required to complete 75 percent attendance and participation to receive the certification or award at the end of each module. Participants can make-up for missed lessons to achieve the required 75 percent at the discretion of their leader.<br>
                                       <br>
Fostering togetherness is at the heart of a model for discipleship, which the General Conference is focusing on; it is known as “Together<br>
Growing Fruitful Disciples.” This model emphasizes understanding, connecting, equipping, and ministering—but doing all of this<br>
“together.” For God did not design us to grow or minister alone, but in community. Paul writes that growing in Christ is achieved as<br>
everyone uses the gifts God has given to them, “until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become<br>
mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13).<br>
                                       <br>
Thank you for helping to educate our young people to become Ambassadors of Jesus Christ and His kingdom.<br>

1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
As a human being with a nature that naturally tends to move away from God, growing to reflect Jesus as an Ambassador will rarely happen by chance or without much thought. That’s why for each of the Ambassador’s modules, you will be creating your own IDP. The focus of each IDP will relate to the theme of your current module and last for the duration of that module. Here is an example of what an IDP will look like. Fill in your own IDP on the form provided.<br>
                                       <br>
1. IDP Module Name:<br>
CHRIST-CENTERED DISCIPLESHIP<br>
                                       <br>
2. Spiritual Companion: Who is the spiritual companion who will encourage and support you in the next stage of your spiritual journey of<br>
growing as an Ambassador of Jesus? They will remain your spiritual companion throughout the current module. JOHN WILCOX (Your choice of spiritual companion is added in session Leave blank for now.)<br>
                                       <br>
3. Personal vision statement: This includes two parts: <br>
(a) What do you see in your life today that you would like to change in order to become more effective as an Ambassador for Jesus? <br>
(b) Describe how you would like to see yourself in the future. Before you start writing, take a moment to pray for God to guide your thoughts.<br>
                                       <br>
• CURRENTLY, I DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR OR VERY MEANINGFUL DEVOTIONAL LIFE.<br>
• I WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP A DEVOTIONAL LIFE THAT CAN EQUIP ME SPIRITUALLY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR FOR JESUS.<br>
                                       <br>
4. Expected evidence of change: After looking at your personal vision statement, list the evidence you might expect to see that reveals you are<br>
growing in Christ.<br>
• I THINK AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR IS SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS PRAYING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO REVEAL THE CHARACTER OF JESUS<br>
WHEREVER THEY GO. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR MY LIFE.<br>
                                       <br>
5. Next steps: List the practical steps you will take to accomplish your personal discipleship vision. Think about how these steps will also<br>
shape your daily devotions with God.<br>
• SET MY ALARM CLOCK FOR 7AM TO START MY DEVOTIONS<br>
• SPEND 30 MINUTES IN PRAYER AND BIBLE READING<br>
• REPEAT BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP<br>
• FIND A BOOK TO READ THAT TEACHES DIFFERENT WAYS TO STUDY THE BIBLE<br>
• PRAY EACH DAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME AS HIS AMBASSADOR<br>
                                       <br>
6. Reflection: How did I do? This is completed at the end of the module. It gives you a chance to reflect on what worked well and what you<br>
would like to improve in the future. You can compare your expected evidences of change to what actually happened.<br>
                                       <br>
• I REALLY ENJOYED THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. THE MORE I READ AND UNDERSTOOD, THE MORE CONFIDENT I BECAME TO PRAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME. I THINK I WILL EXPAND THE TIME FOR DEVOTIONS I HAVE IN THE EVENING, AND NOW THAT I HAVE READ A BOOK ON BIBLE STUDY, I WOULD LIKE TO READ ANOTHER ON INTERCESSORY PRAYER. I HAVE FOUND THAT I REALLY ENJOY PRAYING FOR OTHERS.<br>
                                       <br>

2+ min<br>
1. General welcome and opening prayer.<br>
2. A short getting-to-know you activity. As friendships continually deepen, so the ability to encourage and<br>
support each other spiritually deepens.<br>
did you know?<br>
13 minutes<br>
An activity that introduces the theme for the day.<br>
mission briefing<br>
10 minutes<br>
A simple Bible study that gives the biblical foundation for the theme done in groups of two or three. It will be<br>
helpful for leaders to circulate around the room to listen in on conversations to see that participants are going in<br>
the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
thinking it through<br>
5 minutes<br>
A personal reflection time where each participant writes down what they have personally learned from the Bible<br>
study and how this applies to their own life as an Ambassador. To be shared briefly with their spiritual companion<br>
who will be a spiritual encourager during the curriculum.<br>
reflecting Jesus &amp;<br>
His kingdom<br>
40 minutes<br>
An activity that expands on the main theme for the lesson. This section is called “reflecting Jesus and His kingdom”<br>
because an Ambassador’s main task is to represent who Jesus is to others, as well as what the kingdom of heaven<br>
stands for.<br>
next steps<br>
15 minutes<br>
An Ambassador for Jesus will grow spiritually and will witnesses in everyday life beyond the training sessions.<br>
Therefore, each participant will develop an individual discipleship plan that will help them grow as an Ambassador<br>
for Jesus when they are outside of the learning environment.<br>
At the beginning of each module in the curriculum, participants will develop an individual discipleship plan (IDP)<br>
that will guide their personal spiritual journey during that section. Each IDP will focus on the theme of that section.<br>
“Next Steps” is a time for participants to reflect on how their IDP is working and to pray for each other in what they<br>
aim to do next. This will be done with their spiritual companion. A spiritual companion is a friend who prays for and<br>
encourages their own companion over a set period of time.<br>
summary<br>
5 minutes<br>
As a whole group, this is an opportunity to summarize what participants have learned during the session. It is a time<br>
for the leader to generally review what has been done and to ask for volunteers to briefly share what they have<br>
learned.<br>
basic template for teaching sessions<br>
This template will be used during most in-house teaching sessions. There will be variations in the format<br>

leader notes 1. This lesson introduces the theme of the whole curriculum—the calling to be an Ambassador for the<br>
kingdom of heaven and its King, Jesus.<br>
2. If some of the young people are new to your group, you may want to add a get-to-know-you activity in the<br>
introduction. The more comfortable young people are with each other, the better they will grow together<br>
spiritually.<br>
3. Notice the learning outcomes below. For each learning outcome, there is a corresponding “evidence of<br>
learning.” This section will help you identify what your participants should be learning and what evidence<br>
you should look for to see that they are learning well. In brackets, you will see in which part of the lesson<br>
plan the outcomes and evidence of learning will take place.<br>
4. There is a lot to do in each section. Make sure you work within the given time for each section in order to<br>
cover the material.<br>

? did you know...<br>
God has called me to be His Ambassador<br>
“So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making His appeal through us.<br>
We speak for Christ when we plead, ‘Come back to God!’”<br>
2 Corinthians 5:20, NLT<br>
An Ambassador is a diplomatic agent of the highest rank<br>
accredited to a foreign government or sovereign as the<br>
resident representative of his own government<br>
or sovereign or appointed for a special<br>
and often temporary diplomatic assignment<br>
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition<br>
24 1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
mission briefing<br>
The Bible is God’s book to show His Ambassadors how to live on earth while representing His kingdom in heaven. It explains who God is,<br>
who we are, and where we are going. At the heart of this book is the revelation of Jesus, and that only through His Holy Spirit can His<br>
Ambassadors make an eternal impact in the world. Before sin, we would have known how to live without having it written down because<br>
God’s laws and principles would have been written on our hearts and minds. But while we live with very forgetful memories, God has chosen<br>
to write everything down for us.<br>
1. As Ambassadors we use words to encourage people to turn to Jesus. But who we are—our characters—demonstrate the truth and<br>
power of our words. In other words, who we are makes our words believable. In Ezekiel 36:23-26, God promises to reveal His holiness to<br>
the nations “through” His people. In these verses, what is the most important thing that will enable you to reveal to others the truth<br>
about God?<br>
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
2. Ellen White wrote that character is defined as our “thoughts and feelings combined.” From Matthew 5:1-12, what do you think are the<br>
thoughts and feelings that will shape an ambassador’s mind and heart as they live out these qualities of the kingdom of God on earth?<br>

                                       <strong>Welcome to Ambassadors</strong><br>
                                       <br>
Ambassadors is a new level of youth ministry designed to equip leaders with resources to train a new generation of youths to be the hands, feet, and voice of Jesus in their local churches and communities.<br>
                                       <br>
An ambassador generally represents a country or a cause. A Christian ambassador is a representative of another kind; they represent the values, principles, culture, and laws of the kingdom of God. They stand for the character and purpose of the King of this kingdom—Jesus Christ, Himself.<br>
                                       <br>
This Youth Department resource is based on seven foundations that are considered as essential to meet the developmental needs of our young people between the ages of 16-21. <br>
                                       <br>
They include:<br>
                                       <br>
1. A Christ-centered discipleship plan<br>
2. Leadership development<br>
3. A personal, public, and small group based mission lifestyle<br>
4. Character and personality development, including outdoor, high adventure programming<br>
5. Lifestyle and vocational training<br>
6. Nurturing godly relationships<br>
7. Community outreach development through service projects and emergency preparedness training<br>
                                       <br>
Each of these seven foundations will be presented in modules, with participants gaining certification for each module completed. While<br>
each module has a specific focus, there are FOUR elements that will be common throughout the curriculum. Leaders MUST ensure that all these elements are embraced to make the experience meaningful, attractive, and challenging.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>1. First - The concept of a spiritual companion</strong><br>
At the beginning of each module, each participant will choose a friend who will be their companion for the duration of the module. They will meet during each session to encourage and support each other in their role and growth as an Ambassador. Groups of spiritual companions will also come together for specific activities. This builds the concept of interdependence and accountability into the Ambassador experience.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>2. Second - An Individual Discipleship Plan (IDP)</strong><br>
At the beginning of every module, each participant will make a simple plan of how they would like to grow spiritually and acquire practical competency in the area of the upcoming module. Their spiritual companion will be there throughout the module to help and encourage them to accomplish their plan. The IDP helps to emphasize the continuing nature of discipleship and that learning is a continual part of life. By linking spiritual companions together for this work, it stresses the need for interdependence on each other as we learn, grow, and work for God.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>3. Third - Projects<br>
                                       </strong>Each module will have a project that will integrate the core concepts from the module into a service learning activity focused on helping others. This will be an opportunity for the Ambassador class to work together as a whole. You will find INSTRUCTIONS for setting up your project in the back pages of this Leader’s Guide. You might have to plan for multiple projects, depending on the size of your group.<br>
                                       <br>
• The main objective is to incorporate service as a way of life, rather than an occasional activity.<br>
• Aim for projects that would call for regular involvement over a period of time.<br>
• Make contact with your Volunteer Service organizations, the local Council, and other entities that could assist you.<br>
• If your group settles on a particular medium/long term project, there is no need to change the project when the time comes to engage with a new module. Use your discretion.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <strong>4. Fourth - Social Activities </strong><br>
Ensure that you plan for a social activity at least once a month. Make sure that you always provide opportunities for good and wholesome fun for that age group.<br>
• You do not have to conduct all your sessions in a building. As appropriate, conduct some in nature, in the context of a camp, in<br>
someone’s home, etc.<br>
• In the back pages of your Leader’s Guide you will find a list of websites where you can access ‘Ice Breakers’ or brief fun activities that you can inject into all your sessions.<br>
                                       <br>
Of course, CONDUCT ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES PRAYERFULLY.<br>
RECOMMENDATION<br>
                                       <br>
It is highly recommended that you set aside your first meeting as a fun ORIENTATION to share the Ambassadors concept, share the Participant’s Guides, give an overview of the first module, discuss the FOUR elements and their implementation, discuss the frequency of meetings, organize calendars, etc.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <em>Participant’s Guide</em><br>
A participant’s guide for each module has been prepared for each participant.<br>
• The Participant’s Guide is essentially the workbook containing all the sessions of each module that the participant will engage with.<br>
• In the back pages of each module there is a page for creating the IDP. There is also a list of the sessions for that module that the leader will date and sign upon the participant’s completion.<br>
• Each participant will be required to complete 75 percent attendance and participation to receive the certification or award at the end of each module. Participants can make-up for missed lessons to achieve the required 75 percent at the discretion of their leader.<br>
                                       <br>
Fostering togetherness is at the heart of a model for discipleship, which the General Conference is focusing on; it is known as “Together<br>
Growing Fruitful Disciples.” This model emphasizes understanding, connecting, equipping, and ministering—but doing all of this<br>
“together.” For God did not design us to grow or minister alone, but in community. Paul writes that growing in Christ is achieved as<br>
everyone uses the gifts God has given to them, “until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become<br>
mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13).<br>

1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
As a human being with a nature that naturally tends to move away from God, growing to reflect Jesus as an Ambassador will rarely happen by chance or without much thought. That’s why for each of the Ambassador’s modules, you will be creating your own IDP. The focus of each IDP will relate to the theme of your current module and last for the duration of that module. Here is an example of what an IDP will look like. Fill in your own IDP on the form provided.<br>
                                       <br>
1. IDP Module Name:<br>
CHRIST-CENTERED DISCIPLESHIP<br>
                                       <br>
2. Spiritual Companion: Who is the spiritual companion who will encourage and support you in the next stage of your spiritual journey of<br>
growing as an Ambassador of Jesus? They will remain your spiritual companion throughout the current module. JOHN WILCOX (Your choice of spiritual companion is added in session Leave blank for now.)<br>
                                       <br>
3. Personal vision statement: This includes two parts: <br>
(a) What do you see in your life today that you would like to change in order to become more effective as an Ambassador for Jesus? <br>
(b) Describe how you would like to see yourself in the future. Before you start writing, take a moment to pray for God to guide your thoughts.<br>
                                       <br>
• CURRENTLY, I DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR OR VERY MEANINGFUL DEVOTIONAL LIFE.<br>
• I WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP A DEVOTIONAL LIFE THAT CAN EQUIP ME SPIRITUALLY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR FOR JESUS.<br>
                                       <br>
4. Expected evidence of change: After looking at your personal vision statement, list the evidence you might expect to see that reveals you are<br>
growing in Christ.<br>
• I THINK AN EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR IS SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS PRAYING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO REVEAL THE CHARACTER OF JESUS<br>
WHEREVER THEY GO. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR MY LIFE.<br>
                                       <br>
5. Next steps: List the practical steps you will take to accomplish your personal discipleship vision. Think about how these steps will also<br>
shape your daily devotions with God.<br>
• SET MY ALARM CLOCK FOR 7AM TO START MY DEVOTIONS<br>
• SPEND 30 MINUTES IN PRAYER AND BIBLE READING<br>
• REPEAT BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP<br>
• FIND A BOOK TO READ THAT TEACHES DIFFERENT WAYS TO STUDY THE BIBLE<br>
• PRAY EACH DAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME AS HIS AMBASSADOR<br>
                                       <br>
6. Reflection: How did I do? This is completed at the end of the module. It gives you a chance to reflect on what worked well and what you<br>
would like to improve in the future. You can compare your expected evidences of change to what actually happened.<br>
                                       <br>
• I REALLY ENJOYED THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. THE MORE I READ AND UNDERSTOOD, THE MORE CONFIDENT I BECAME TO PRAY FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD TO USE ME. I THINK I WILL EXPAND THE TIME FOR DEVOTIONS I HAVE IN THE EVENING, AND NOW THAT I HAVE READ A BOOK ON BIBLE STUDY, I WOULD LIKE TO READ ANOTHER ON INTERCESSORY PRAYER. I HAVE FOUND THAT I REALLY ENJOY PRAYING FOR OTHERS.<br>

CREATING YOUR IDP<br>

welcome &amp; activity<br>
2+ min<br>
1. General welcome and opening prayer.<br>
2. A short getting-to-know you activity. As friendships continually deepen, so the ability to encourage and<br>
support each other spiritually deepens.<br>

13 minutes<br>
An activity that introduces the theme for the day.<br>
mission briefing<br>
10 minutes<br>
A simple Bible study that gives the biblical foundation for the theme done in groups of two or three. It will be<br>
helpful for leaders to circulate around the room to listen in on conversations to see that participants are going in<br>
the right direction and to answer questions.<br>
thinking it through<br>
5 minutes<br>
A personal reflection time where each participant writes down what they have personally learned from the Bible<br>
study and how this applies to their own life as an Ambassador. To be shared briefly with their spiritual companion<br>
who will be a spiritual encourager during the curriculum.<br>
reflecting Jesus &amp;<br>
His kingdom<br>
40 minutes<br>
An activity that expands on the main theme for the lesson. This section is called “reflecting Jesus and His kingdom”<br>
because an Ambassador’s main task is to represent who Jesus is to others, as well as what the kingdom of heaven<br>
stands for.<br>
next steps<br>
15 minutes<br>
An Ambassador for Jesus will grow spiritually and will witnesses in everyday life beyond the training sessions.<br>
Therefore, each participant will develop an individual discipleship plan that will help them grow as an Ambassador<br>
for Jesus when they are outside of the learning environment.<br>
At the beginning of each module in the curriculum, participants will develop an individual discipleship plan (IDP)<br>
that will guide their personal spiritual journey during that section. Each IDP will focus on the theme of that section.<br>
“Next Steps” is a time for participants to reflect on how their IDP is working and to pray for each other in what they<br>
aim to do next. This will be done with their spiritual companion. A spiritual companion is a friend who prays for and<br>
encourages their own companion over a set period of time.<br>
summary<br>
5 minutes<br>
As a whole group, this is an opportunity to summarize what participants have learned during the session. It is a time<br>
for the leader to generally review what has been done and to ask for volunteers to briefly share what they have<br>
learned.<br>
basic template for teaching sessions<br>
This template will be used during most in-house teaching sessions. There will be variations in the format<br>
depending on the focus for the day.<br>

35 minutes<br>
Activity 1 (10 min)<br>

are in the dark”—D L Moody. Third: “Character is destiny”—Heraclitus. Fourth: “Character is like a tree<br>
and reputation like its shadow”—Abraham Lincoln.<br>
3. Ask participants to stand next to the definition of character that they like the best.<br>
4. Once participants are standing next to their preferred definition, ask them to share with the group<br>
standing with them why they chose that particular definition.<br>

“So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making His appeal through us.<br>

2 Corinthians 5:20, NLT<br>
An Ambassador is a diplomatic agent of the highest rank<br>
accredited to a foreign government or sovereign as the<br>
resident representative of his own government<br>
or sovereign or appointed for a special<br>
and often temporary diplomatic assignment<br>
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition<br>
24 1: I am an ambassador for another world<br>
mission briefing<br>
The Bible is God’s book to show His Ambassadors how to live on earth while representing His kingdom in heaven. It explains who God is,<br>
who we are, and where we are going. At the heart of this book is the revelation of Jesus, and that only through His Holy Spirit can His<br>
Ambassadors make an eternal impact in the world. Before sin, we would have known how to live without having it written down because<br>
God’s laws and principles would have been written on our hearts and minds. But while we live with very forgetful memories, God has chosen<br>
to write everything down for us.<br>
1. As Ambassadors we use words to encourage people to turn to Jesus. But who we are—our characters—demonstrate the truth and<br>
power of our words. In other words, who we are makes our words believable. In Ezekiel 36:23-26, God promises to reveal His holiness to<br>
the nations “through” His people. In these verses, what is the most important thing that will enable you to reveal to others the truth<br>
about God?<br>
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
2. Ellen White wrote that character is defined as our “thoughts and feelings combined.” From Matthew 5:1-12, what do you think are the<br>
thoughts and feelings that will shape an ambassador’s mind and heart as they live out these qualities of the kingdom of God on earth?<br>

“Late adolescents” who come to church are a varied lot. Most of them likely come from Seventh-day Adventist families and are familiar with the basic concepts of salvation, church, and living in harmony with God. Some have come up through Sabbath school and Pathfinders. You can’t assume, however, that all the teens who show up have such a background. Some have met God personally and committed their lives to Him, while others are still searching and making up their minds.<br>
                                       <br>
The Ambassador program is a discipleship program for the late adolescents in the local church. Be sure to seek out and invite all the teens in the 16–21 age group that you can find in your church. Make them all feel welcome. The program is entirely for their benefit. Young people who have completed Pathfinders have two options: <br>
1. They can immediately choose to specialize in leadership by opting for either the Adventist Youth Leadership or Master Guide program, or <br>
2. Join the Ambassador group. Teens who have not gone through Pathfinders may join either Ambassadors or AY Leadership.<br>
                                       <br>
Those who engage in the Ambassador program can be encouraged to embark on the specialized leadership training (Master Guide or AY Leadership) at any time, but preferably after completing an entire module of learning. Similarly, those who complete Master Guide and AY Leadership can be prompted to join the Ambassador group.<br>

The cross in the logo points to the fact that Jesus’ sacrifice is the center of a relationship with Him. The cross on the earth is symbolic of His sacrifice, giving us hope of a new and better life both here on earth through the concept of servant leadership and through an earth made new at His return. The open book is the Word of God, the foundation for our faith, knowledge, and lifestyle. It is open because it’s a message for us to internalize as our constant guide and companion. It is also for sharing with all who will freely receive it. The graded colors of yellow to orange represent the dawn of eternal life that follows the darkness of our temporal experience on this sinful earth.</span><br>

The mission of Seventh-day Adventist youth ministry is to lead young people into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ and help them embrace His call to discipleship. In the model of youth ministry outlined in re-Visioning Youth Ministries, Jesus is the center of all youth ministry as He is the center of all aspects of church life. His life on earth informs us of the three foundational aspects of Christian living, namely discipleship (spirituality), church community, and mission. The Ambassador program is dedicated to nurturing, training, and equipping young people in all three types of ministry.<br>
                                       <br>
The Ambassador Purpose Statement: The Ambassador group is an organization of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church dedicated to meeting the spiritual, social, and lifestyle needs of youth ages 16-21 by challenging them to experience and share a personal relationship with Christ, developing a lifestyle fitting their belief system and vocational interest, and providing them with an adequate venue for wholesome development of lifelong friendships.<br>

In the Seventh-day Adventist Church we are committed to understanding our teen youth and training them for discipleship, leadership, and service to humanity. The Ambassador ministry is not an extension of the Pathfinder Club; it has a different programmatic format. It does not incorporate the same emblems and devices as used by the Pathfinder Club except that divisions of the world field may choose to get involved in honors or class levels appropriate for the age group.<br>
                                       <br>
The Ambassador ministry is also not a general Senior Youth meeting, nor does it necessarily fulfill the role of Senior Youth, which provides a balanced ministry program for the 16–30+ age group within the church community, and it is generally led by youth.<br>
                                       <br>
The Ambassador program exists primarily to provide upper teens with an organized system that will promote their active involvement in the church (both locally and globally) as well as their community while providing them with opportunities to discover their God-given talents and life vocation.<br>
                                       <br>
The particular focus of a local group should be determined by the leader and the local leadership team in consultation with the teens wishing to participate. The overall goals and mission of the organization must be kept in the process. The focus may vary during any given program year, and it may develop and change over several years based on cycles of training and the arrival of new teens.<br>

To ensure that your ministry brings “late adolescents” into a fulfilling walk with God and their rightful place in the church, consider the following objectives as you explore and develop the program:<br>
                                       <br>
Make the number-one priority of your Ambassador programming to be the personal salvation of each and every teen who is a member.<br>
Encourage teens to discover their God-given talents and to use their gifts and abilities to fulfill God’s expectations for them.<br>
                                       <br>
Teach the teens to internalize God’s love and His principles so that they will take responsibility for their walk with God and use His principles and the guidance of the Holy Spirit to make wise decisions in their lives.<br>
Help teens to realize that God and His church love them and appreciate the implementation of their talents for the fulfilling of the gospel commission as established in Matt. 28:18–20 and Acts 1:8. Help them find fulfillment in their life with God as they share their beliefs with those whom God brings to them.<br>
                                       <br>
Teach an understanding and love for God’s creation through programs of adventure and discovery. The young people will find their fellowship with God to be more meaningful as they have the opportunity to experience that sense of wonder and worship as nature unfolds its deepest spiritual secrets as described in Romans 1:19, 20.<br>
                                       <br>
Inspire the teens to give personal expression of their love for God by teaching them how to be involved in various outreach activities.<br>
Teach the teens specific vocational skills and hobbies that will provide them with purpose and employment opportunities.<br>
                                       <br>
Encourage the young people to develop and maintain physical fitness through an active, energetic, drug-free lifestyle.<br>
                                       <br>
Provide them with opportunities to develop and demonstrate their leadership abilities. They will strengthen their resolve to learn and maintain appropriate internal discipline and apply their skills of resourcefulness and understanding of the processes of group dynamics.<br>
Provide ample opportunities for teens to interact in carefully supervised activities that will lead to and strengthen life-long committed relationships.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
The field of developmental psychology distinguishes between middle adolescence (ages 15–17) and late adolescence (18–21). However, the latter stage is simply an advancing of the development that began in the earlier stage rather than a radical change. Here we will examine some of the characteristics of late adolescents that begin in the mid-teens and come to full fruition as the young person hits their twenties.<br>
                                       <br>
The stereotypical view of the teen years is that they are “difficult.” This is an unfortunate and misleading concept of a life stage that can be interesting and fun. It’s true that in the mid-teens a young person may have increased conflict with parents and other adults because they have begun to embrace their own sense of being in the world. Some teens feel that they have to actively wrestle their place and identity from people around them (the turbulent ones), while others may act with passive aggression as they differentiate themselves (the sullen ones). The adults in a teenager’s life can help this process of identity differentiation by being a steady and loving presence and keeping to healthy boundaries while offering reassurance and open communication.<br>
                                       <br>
The youngest teens in the Ambassador age group are a mix of seemingly contradictory characteristics. They are very sensitive and have strong reactions to hurt, insult, and unfairness. They may feel invincible and indestructible. Some of them have found a sense of self-confidence while others have very little. As they learn about the world around them, middle adolescents may show flashes of wisdom and common sense mixed with impulsive and/or risky behavior and unwise choices. Teens whose parents taught them in earlier years to think about the consequences of their decisions have an advantage at this stage. From middle adolescence on, teens have increasing capacity for abstract thought and a broadening sense of the issues in the world. It’s not surprising that the teen years are known as a time of questioning.<br>
                                       <br>
Ideas and expectations, they accepted without question in early adolescence are now up for argument. For many adults, this looks like arrogance or rebellion, but it is not necessarily so. As the “new people on the scene,” teenagers aren’t conscious that others have gone before them, so revelations about our conflict filled world look brand new to them. Faced with resolving several identity-related tasks at once, teens are likely to come across as brutally honest about problems and as challenging to authority that seems to them to have decreasing legitimacy. They want the “truth” and need things honestly explained and proven. Physically, middle adolescents may go through a growth spurt. Some of them don’t reach full height and physical maturity until after high school. A sense of the physical self emerges, both of muscularity and personal appearance, and concern about their appearance becomes prominent.<br>
                                       <br>
Social life is key for teens and the source of both stress and happiness. Cliques and best friends become a haven for security and familiarity. Regardless of the wishes and constraints of parents and others, many middle and upper teens begin to pair up and enter one-on-one male/female relationships. Sexuality becomes a force to be reckoned with. School is the central focus for much of this socialization, and it is the environment for many of the biggest issues in a teen’s life.<br>
                                       <br>
Even though this age group is striving for a sense of personal identity, teens often follow the herd (a.k.a. peer pressure) and are influenced by popular opinion. They can be susceptible to influence by celebrities and celebrity culture in such areas as lifestyle choices and personal values. For some of them, music and clothes become a way of trying on identities. They may take on and slough off a series of values and ideas. Don’t look for consistency but rather a growing maturity as teens move into late adolescence.<br>
                                       <br>
Over the years of adolescence, teens become conscious of money, work, and a nascent sense of calling. Some will get their first jobs, and you may even find teens who want to drop out of school. Practical advice offered in a non-judgmental way often helps them steer through this transitional stage. Even if teens don’t seem to be looking for guidance, and perhaps seem to push it away, they will indeed take in much of the counsel adults offer them. The fruit of it may appear later.<br>
                                       <br>
Spiritually, the teen age group is almost always on a search for a path that is credible and makes sense. What role will God play in their lives? That is the big question for them. As you may have experienced, teens can spot insincerity, inconsistency, and hypocrisy a mile away. The ideals Jesus gave us become real to them, and even if they are too respectful to bring it up, many want to know why the adults around them don’t measure up. Coming to terms with our sinfulness and God’s forgiveness is a big need for them and may be a significant part of your spiritual discussion and their learning.<br>
                                       <br>
Late adolescents have reached a fairly stable, if incomplete, sense of themselves, with a roughed-out set of values. Given the right opportunities, they are capable of intelligent and balanced exploration of new ideas and of taking on a mature sense of responsibility. With training, they can develop the ability to lead others into what is good and right and true.<br>

Pick any story about a person in the Bible and you’ll see God working out His purposes in that individual’s life. For those who were converted and faithful to God, the purpose was to educate and grow and refine their character in preparation for living in the kingdom of God.<br>
                                       <br>
In the twentieth century, personality rather than character became the focus of both scholarship and popular thinking about human development as new psychological awareness spread across cultures around the world. When we look at a recent review of the literature written over the past two hundred years that deals with success, it is interesting to note a clear trend. For the first one hundred and fifty years, success is defined in terms of such qualities as “integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the golden rule.” <br>
                                       <br>
In other words, success was defined by positive character traits. However, during the past fifty years there has been a clear shift from a character ethic focus to what is called a personality ethic. The personality ethic concentrates on public image and a positive mental attitude (Tom Osborne, On Solid Ground). There is danger for young people today in not being taught and trained in the character traits God created. These character traits are some of the absolutes that we become convicted about when we accept <br>
                                       <br>
God’s way for us. They are the true focus of God’s work in us. Hand in hand with this change in society’s thinking is the cultural shift into situational ethics and moral relativism. The default position in the minds of many people today is that beliefs and convictions are the subjective decision of each individual, and that moral and ethical decisions should be dictated by the situation rather than the unchanging principles of God. The idea that God gives absolute truths that always apply is irrelevant to the mind of a moral relativist. Even among some Christians, this idea has taken root.<br>
                                       <br>
This is completely contrary to the unchanging, eternal reality of God’s perfect principles. The teens born near the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first grew up in a world in which human beings assume the responsibility for making a moral framework that belongs to God alone. Until recently, society assumed certain things to be always wrong, even if many were violating the principle involved. Today, the assumption that there is anything that’s truly wrong has largely faded away. No youth leader should be surprised that late adolescents, even the ones who grew up in the church, have this nonbiblical outlook and have to be shown that some things are always wrong.<br>
                                       <br>
The well-known thought from the book Education by Ellen G. White applies to the leaders of Ambassador ministry today: “The greatest want of the world is the want of men [and women] . . . who will not be bought or sold, . . . who in their inmost souls are true and honest, . . . who do not fear to call sin by its right name, . . . whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole, . . . who will stand for the right though the heavens fall” (57).<br>

The ages involved in the Ambassador category include those who are considered under-age in some settings, along with young adults who can be expected to take full responsibility for their actions. The expectation is that all of the Ambassadors will function with self-discipline. Such may not always be the case. You may have sixteen-year-olds who think they are twenty-five, and occasionally you’ll have an older young adult who is not willing to live up to the average level of maturity in their age group.<br>
                                       <br>
So how does a leader set manageable rules that will be respected and enable the organization to function smoothly? A leader must set expectations early on, while not being heavy-handed. “A few simple rules” is a good place to start. The golden rule works well, as does an agreement to love everyone and build them up. You might draw up a short list of principles from God’s Word that you present to the group as the compass for the journey ahead. Bring up basic rules again when the group is doing an activity or taking a trip as a reminder that they are Ambassadors for the King of heaven.<br>
                                       <br>
Every leader will confront situations of poor decision-making and bad behavior on the part of one or more in the group. The leader must pray and have some idea of what to require of the young person. They must call attention to the problem, talking to the individual alone in a calm, polite manner, and offer a solution that must be followed through. It will involve a change of direction and possibly punishment. Each person should be treated as fully responsible for their actions. That is life in the real world.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
You are entering ministry for late adolescents because you have a God-given desire to do so. Before you proceed with the organization of the group, take the following steps of self-preparation. First, spend time in prayer to God, asking for Him to confirm your calling. Take some days to examine your own spiritual state and invite the Holy Spirit to reveal anything you need to see. What have been your spiritual challenges? How is your faith these days? Is it time for a clean-up or a rededication of your life to our Creator? Surrender yourself to God and to His leading. Allow God to remove barriers between you and Him.<br>
                                       <br>
Along with speaking to God, take time to listen. God is all-knowing and wise far beyond our comprehension. He wants us to allow Him to lead in the best paths for our ministry, but He cannot lead if we’re not listening. Allow Him to influence your thinking and your actions. When working with young people, you need the confidence that comes from knowing you’ve put God in charge. “Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans” (Proverbs 16:3). If you proceed in your own confidence and counsel, it’s only a matter of time before you make a mistake that could have been avoided. No doubt you will meet challenges and things will go wrong sometimes, but when you’ve put God in charge, He is the One who will solve the difficulties.<br>
                                       <br>
A last helpful step in preparing yourself is to look carefully at your motives and your level of preparedness to do the ministry. Does the salvation and discipleship of young people drive your desire to lead in Ambassador ministry? How experienced are you in working with youth? Do you need training? Do you need help? These are available. Be honest in your assessment.<br>

In whichever way you prefer to do it, draw up some basic plans. The vision for the Ambassador group starts with you. Write down specific goals based on the suggestions in Section 1, brainstorm some activities for each of them, and list possibilities such as a place and time to meet and a tentative schedule for the first year. Write up a budget for materials, transportation, entrance fees, and other expenses. Investigate sources of funding. Begin to pray and talk with potential co-leaders. Two things will determine your success in Ambassador ministry: God’s guidance, and a vibrant, competent leadership team.<br>

If you have a conference/field/mission youth director in your territory, show him or her your tentative plans and ask about the resources available to you. Think of your Ambassador group as an exercise in collaboration and the youth director as a board member who can help you with vision and implementation. It’s good advice for free. Take advantage of it. Remember to go to the meeting with an open mind, ready to learn.<br>
                                       <br>
Around the same time, ask your pastor and possibly the church elder to meet with you. The primary goal is to seek and hopefully obtain your pastor’s support and encouragement to proceed with the Ambassador group. Pray for the Holy Spirit’s guidance before the meeting, and then present your plan. Many pastors are overworked and spread too thin, and there is no way to predict what response you will get. But listen carefully and act in a Christ-like way no matter what happens. <br>
                                       <br>
Before the meeting is over, ask for a promise of support. You will need to figure out who to ask about a regular meeting place. Typically the place you would want to use is within your church’s facilities. The chair of the church board is a good person to talk with first. If you’re planning to use a Sabbath school room as your meeting place, talk to the Sabbath school leader about a class location.<br>
                                       <br>
You are probably adding a new group to the roster of ministries in your congregation. Aim to become a complement to the ones already going. Among the people to share your plans with are the current Pathfinder and teen Sabbath school leaders so that they know to send their youth to your ministry as the young people reach the right age. It’s also time to reach out to the parents of late adolescents in your church with an outline of your plans so they can be a voice of encouragement to their children when the group launches.<br>
                                       <br>
After you have adequate support from the leaders and interested parties around you, bring your<br>
formal plan to the church board for approval. Again, this is an opportunity to listen for counsel about how best to proceed. Ask the board to approve you as leader of the group if that is your plan. Further, ask board members to appoint someone (usually one of the board of elders) to be a representative for you and a liaison between church leadership and the Ambassador group.<br>

Choose an executive committee that will create plans and be responsible for making them happen. The committee should consist of four to six leaders and assistants. A larger group becomes unwieldy. It’s wise to make the committee meetings open so that all who are involved in running the group have an opportunity to contribute ideas and counsel. Invite your pastor to attend whenever he or she can do so. Be sure to include in your committee roster the representative chosen by the church board. (See the “Leadership and Structure” section below for how to set up a solid leadership group.)<br>
                                       <br>
Take a census of late adolescents in your church. Look at the membership list for upper high school students and college students. Be sure to find those who have finished school and already begun work. Put out the word that you are beginning an Ambassador group and ask the congregation to suggest names. With your executive committee, set a launch date. The committee can now set up a calendar of meetings and activities. It’s time to research and purchase study materials, make transportation plans for field trips, and assign responsibilities to the group’s leaders.<br>
                                       <br>
As the launch date approaches, prepare your publicity plans. Young people will come to the Ambassador group if notice of the new group is spread wide and deep. Here are some steps to take:<br>
Make one or two formal announcements to your congregation on a Sabbath morning close to the launch date.<br>
Brief your church’s leaders on the plans you have in place and ask them to spread the word.<br>
                                       <br>
Issue an invitation. Choose several methods of contacting young people in the target age group such as a face-to-face conversation, a letter, an email, a Facebook page invitation, and phone calls. A personal invitation to each young person is the most effective.<br>
                                       <br>
Create and print posters, brochures, business cards, bookmarks or other publicity items that convey the basic details of the new Ambassador group.<br>

In many parts of the world, a ministry group like Ambassadors will have to be mostly self-financed through fundraising. Several models can be considered. Note that your budget must be set up first of all so you have something to aim for. The first source of funds is the local church. The church board might allocate operating-budget money to youth groups. It may also allow the Ambassador group to ask the church for offerings and donations. Families of the young people may be especially willing to contribute on a regular basis. You can set a participation fee for the young people themselves, or they could be presented with the invitation to give as they are able to partially support the program.<br>
                                       <br>
In some territories of the world, the local conference/field/mission may have funds designated to subsidize youth ministry. Be sure to ask your regional youth director. As the Ambassador group becomes involved in community projects and volunteer work, its profile will rise in the community. You as the leader can then consider presenting proposals to civic organizations and local businesses, asking that they financially support the youth in specific projects. This will require that you create formal advertising materials that define the Ambassador group and how it helps young people to benefit the community.<br>
                                       <br>
Recreational activities may have an entrance fee. The executive committee should prayerfully choose activities that meet the objectives of the group and then decide how much to subsidize the activity and how much of the fee might be charged to the young people. A careful balance should be struck between, on the one hand, too much subsidy that cuts down on a sense of investment among the youth, and, on the other, too high a cost barrier for some participants.<br>
                                       <br>
If you engage in fundraising projects, keep the following in mind:<br>
Bring every project to the church board for approval.<br>
                                       <br>
If you sell something, make sure it is in harmony with the Bible, the identity of the church, and local ordinances.<br>
                                       <br>
Make sure that projects or products give consumers their money’s worth. Church fundraising should not come across as confidence tricks or fraud. Don’t use anything that looks like gambling.<br>
                                       <br>
Check to see if your project might be encroaching on similar activities of other ministries in the church. Find types of projects that are yours alone.<br>
                                       <br>
Make every effort to conduct projects that do not take away employment from adults in the community who need it.<br>
                                       <br>
Be sure to present a financial report of the Ambassador group to the church board on an agreed-upon schedule, but no less than once a year.</span><br>

Your church should have liability insurance, but you should ask the board chair to explain what insurance the church has and what it covers. Depending on the country or region you live in, you may have to include insurance in your budget to cover specific types of activities, transportation issues, and other contingencies. <br>
                                       <br>
Err on the side of caution with insurance. Pay a visit to the conference/field/mission treasurer for advice. Make sure your group is broadly covered. Remember also that having insurance does not mean you should not be careful about safety. At all times, temper the desire to provide challenges and character growth with the thought that you must safeguard your teens and make sure they come home alive and uninjured.</span><br>

Assign specific roles to leaders so that responsibilities are clear.<br>
Sponsor. This person is appointed by the church board as the elder or church leader who acts as an advocate and adviser for the Ambassador group. While the group director will likely make presentations to the board, Ambassadors will benefit from having a leader who is familiar with what the group is doing and advocates for it.<br>
                                       <br>
Director/group leader. This person is elected by the church board. He or she is responsible for all club doings and accountable to the church board. The person should be someone who has shown a high degree of maturity and proper financial management skills as well as a high degree of interest in the youth of the church. It is recommended that this person also be a member of the church board.<br>
                                       <br>
Assistant director/group leader. This person may be elected by the church board or chosen by the director in consultation with the church pastor or elder. He or she must have the same characteristics as the director and will substitute for the director whenever necessary.<br>
                                       <br>
Sub-committee chairs. The following groups may benefit from a leader for each of them. The divisions of labor may be lumped together or split further, depending on the size and scale of the Ambassador group and availability of volunteers.<br>
                                       <br>
Social<br>
Outreach<br>
Music<br>
Recreation<br>
                                       <br>
                                       <em>Note that there is not a separate sub-committee or leader for spiritual matters. The Bible and God’s principles should be infused in every category of activity in Ambassador ministry.</em></span><br>

There is no uniform globally recognized for the club. The Ambassador logo, pin, and a light blue scarf are the generic identifying insignias of the club. There has been some evolution in the recommendations made to clubs or conferences that opt for an unofficial uniform. When this manual was first released in 2006, the recommendation was for a light blue dress polo shirt with the emblem on or above the left pocket area.<br>
                                       <br>
In 2007, this arrangement was changed to a brown polo shirt and khaki pants for men and khaki skirt for women. In 2011, it was further recommended that divisions and unions that choose to wear uniforms adopt the model in the manual but that the color be left to their discretion. A sash or vest can be worn for the placement of pins, honor badges, special event patches, and related items.<br>
                                       <br>
The Youth Leadership pin may be worn by anyone who has completed the proper requirements and been invested. The light blue club scarf with the logo imprinted will be worn by all other club members if so determined by your division youth department. In many countries the wearing of camouflage denotes military or subversive use. <br>
                                       <br>
To protect the church organization and its existence in these countries, military or camouflage clothing is not appropriate at any time. This includes the use of combat boots, blousing of pant legs, and use of any weapons or weapon resembling substitutes. Anything that may be interpreted by governments as indicating a paramilitary organization should not be worn.<br>

You will likely need to have teens register for the group so that you have basic contact information. The form on the next page is an example of such a registration. You can create your own to fit your needs. An online form is a good option. You must keep attendance, involvement, and completion records for all participants at all events. Attendance records should be tallied and included in your reporting to both the executive committee and the church at large.<br>
                                       <br>
Just as important is that you keep complete records on the completion of modules by every participant. It is not the participants’ responsibility. The best practice is to create a folder, binder, or computer spreadsheet in which you record the progress of each participant. Besides being important for reporting on the progress of the Ambassador group, your records will be key evidence for such things as requests for a job recommendation or personal reference, admission to leadership training of various kinds, and proof of completion of classes.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
Once you are launched and the group is underway, you should be aware of some ways to keep the momentum going. Spiritual objectives are the highest priority in your program. In all of your detailed planning, start with the spiritual goal and make sure that any activity serves the goal.<br>
                                       <br>
The entertainment options for young people are endless, and the Ambassador group serves to shine the light of God in their lives. Avoid offering entertainment for its own sake. Hold regular executive committee meetings no less than bi-monthly. Besides giving the chance to plan upcoming activities, the meeting is an opportunity to do a spiritual check-up on yourself and the other leaders. How you model the character and ways of Jesus is even more important than any creative program.<br>
                                       <br>
Also in the meeting, review what has already been done; evaluate the effect of the group on the young people, discuss challenges and changes, and thank leaders and helpers for their work. Review the overall balance of the year’s activities, making sure all your objectives are represented. Personal preference for certain types of activities should not be allowed to sway the program.<br>
                                       <br>
In between meetings, take time to ask individual teens how they are doing and how the group is working out for them. Make a point of asking about their lives so that you are familiar with the basics of each one’s situation. Give them assurance that they can be honest and that you value their input. Ask them to help you with creating and planning activities.<br>
                                       <br>
Be aware of the transitory nature of life for upper teens. You may want consistent participation, but as teens enter young adulthood they are pulled by school and work and life activities that will cause them to come and go. Welcome them at every opportunity, but avoid putting too much pressure on them. You can pray constantly that the Holy Spirit will draw the young people to the group. Your consistent, positive ministry will provide them with a spiritual anchor in their lives.<br>
                                       <br>
Publicity is extremely important for momentum. Inform group members and the church at large constantly! Do it much more than you think is necessary.<br>
                                       <br>
Use several means of communication to announce upcoming Ambassador events. Send two or three announcements a couple of weeks apart, with the second or third announcement a day or two beforehand. Share the announcements with the group members, all leaders and helpers, and church leadership.<br>
                                       <br>
Use personal conversation as part of your publicity. Talk to individual teens about planned events, make phone calls to key communicators in the group, and keep the pastor and other leaders informed once in a while. All leaders and helpers should be made completely and constantly aware of the group’s plans.<br>
                                       <br>
Make a report to the congregation on a scheduled basis. Options to consider are making a short report at announcement time during the church service; creating a short newsletter that describes recent activities and includes quotes from participants; issuing a short-written report to be included in a church newsletter or email distribution; posting group news to your church’s website or a social media web page.<br>
Once a year, write (or delegate to a writer) an article about the Ambassador group to be submitted to the church’s regional news publication. Include some photos of activities and events.<br>

                                    <div class="blogdate">Monday, April 03, 2023<br></div>
                                    <span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
The classes and honors are primarily directed to the Pathfinder Club age group (10–15), however, in the past they have been used by all from the age of ten up through adulthood. This may remain in effect, as time allows. Priority should be given to the completion of the curriculum. Whenever honors are pursued within the Ambassador ministry, the focus and reasoning behind the use of these tools will be different from that of Pathfinder clubs.<br>
                                       <br>
Here, participation is more than just to open up windows of discovery and adventure; it implies development of leadership abilities—the capacity to teach those who are younger. Therefore, if you incorporate classes and honors into your program, you should emphasize completion of the advanced levels.<br>

All those who register for the Ambassador group are entitled to receive a patch and a special pin. A certificate has been developed for each one of the seven modules, which will be given out at the successful completion of each module. A special graduation pin will be awarded at the completion of the seven modules. Young adults need to be affirmed.</span><br>

                                    <span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
Let’s revisit the seven foundations of the Ambassador ministry:<br>
                                       <br>
A Christ-centered discipleship plan Leadership development through such curricula as Master Guide and AY Leadership <br>
                                       <br>
A personal, small-group based, and public evangelistic mission lifestyle <br>
                                       <br>
Character and personality development/awareness through outdoor/high adventure programming <br>
                                       <br>
Lifestyle vocational/career development through specialized training and advanced honor levels <br>
                                       <br>
Friendship and relationship skill development <br>
                                       <br>
Community outreach development through service projects and emergency preparedness training <br>
                                       <br>
Regular attendance meetings should take place at least twice a month, and preferably once a week.<br>
                                       <br>
It should be noted that there is a camping trip and some vocational activities that do not fit into regularly scheduled meetings.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#19171B;"><br>
You can promise young people a rich life through knowing Jesus. It’s not a hollow promise. Jesus said, “I come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly” (John 10:10). A boring life lengthened by proper health habits is not an abundant life. Having said that, we are also not here to be happy because life is easy, life is fair, and life is long. None of those phrases are accurate for anyone—a Christian or a non-Christian. James tells us we can and should be happy regardless of circumstances. Paul understood this as well, which is why he could sing after being beaten or thrown in prison. This may sound a bit morbid, but here’s the reason: today’s society places a major emphasis on having fun—at almost any cost. Entertainment is the way to happiness, says the mindset of the world today. It is one of Satan’s cleverest lies.<br>
                                       <br>
Jeff Jacoby, a columnist for a major newspaper, was evaluating this concept when he wrote the following: “It is not that movies and TV shows are laced with dung, but that they cannot help being laced with dung. So much TV and movie fare is morally corrosive because those industries by their nature are at odds with traditional moral teachings. . . . [They] contradict the fundamental messages of the Judeo-Christian tradition.”<br>
                                       <br>
He goes on to point out many of the contradictions and concludes with this observation: “TV and the movies are obsessed with fun. In the Jewish and Christian traditions, the focus is on happiness. [In the movies,] when the dazzle is over, when the excitement has passed, what’s left? Very few people . . . want to be buried under a stone that says “Here lies ______, he had a lot of fun.” Fun is not what life is about. Yet it is overwhelmingly what the media culture demands. The difference between fun and happiness is like the difference between sex and love. One is easy but quickly ended; the other takes work but can last forever. One appeals to the senses; the other nourishes the soul.”<br>
                                       <br>
It’s not hard to see the contrast of Christian happiness versus amusements that, consumed merely for the sake of pleasure, tend to be carried to excess, weakening our physical, mental, and spiritual powers. Satan is constantly trying to distract young people with new attractions and alluring amusements that destroy their usefulness as people and separate them from God. Recreation that may cause us to temporarily lay aside religious convictions is disastrous. Although recreation invites us to get out of the rat race of technology-driven living, it never should encourage us to be off-duty Christians; religion cannot be a part-time add-on for everyday living.<br>
                                       <br>
Having said all this, we do have some positive guidance: “It is the privilege and duty of Christians to seek to refresh their spirits and invigorate their physical and mental powers to the glory of God” (Messages to Young People, 364). Notice how it is actually a duty for us to participate in recreation as part of that full and balanced life Jesus promised.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
Games<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#19171B;">These fall into several categories. The least edifying are games of chance that encourage gambling, dissipation, and cheating. Those that encourage stimulation of the brain and learning in all its facets—from the Bible to nature to general knowledge—are more acceptable. Those that encourage exercise and social interaction as well as learning are even better.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
Sports<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#19171B;">Sports promoted in the Ambassador program should be participatory and, for the most part, not focused on intense competition. Look at the culture around you and determine which sports foster the development of skills and character and which have become likened to competitive death matches.<br>
                                       <br>
Taking a group of teens to spectator events has many drawbacks and should be avoided. In spectator sports, emotions tend to run high, adrenaline flows in excess, and there’s nowhere for it all to go except in yelling and name calling. Commercial interests tend to exploit star players and make them larger than life.<br>
                                       <br>
This leads to a world of hero worship that is not healthy for young Christians. Ellen White was observing her grandchildren playing baseball one afternoon and someone questioned her about it. Her response was, “I do not condemn the simple exercise of playing ball; but even this in its simplicity, may be overdone” (The Adventist Home, 499). Playing for the right reasons and in moderation are the keys to healthy sports activities.<br>
                                       <br>
Young people are sometimes confused by Ellen White’s statements that apparently condemn bicycle riding and tennis. She was writing about specific situations and laying out principles that we can apply today. In the case of bicycle riding, people were spending large sums of money for racing bicycles—to the tune of several months’ family wages—with the purpose of engaging in races with townspeople. They were neglecting basic family needs of food and clothing in the effort. <br>
                                       <br>
The whole thing was being carried to extremes. A similar situation occurred with tennis. Students were missing classes at school in order to play “just one more game;” competition against the community was organized that developed an unwholesome spirit that needed to be curbed. You can see that taking any recreational activity to an intemperate extreme should be avoided, and not just bicycle riding or tennis. Ellen White was laying out a principle of wholesome activity conducted for the purpose of recreation and within sensible limits.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
Music<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#19171B;">Music is one of those subjects that everyone has an opinion about. The majority of people seem to feel that whatever type of music they prefer is the best type and any other type is either too old-fashioned or too far over the cliff. Just as Satan will use written or spoken words to try and lead people away from God, he will use music to do the same. Like the many genres of writing and speaking, so there are genres of music: comical, dramatic, intense, inspirational, depressive, eloquent, folksy, uplifting, degrading, poetic, grating—all these terms and many more may be applied to both written/spoken language and musical language.<br>
                                       <br>
God is the source of a wide range of musical types. He likes variety, as is shown by His creation. But He is not the author or originator of anything that evokes hypnotic effects, anarchy, dissonance, discord, and destruction of hearing. Since music is not neutral in its effects, in our groups and in our meetings we will want to focus on music that draws us to God without sending mixed messages.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
Discipleship<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#19171B;">Youth ministry does not involve just doing whatever youth enjoy doing, even though there are fun and games in it. The purposes are to build their Christian character, teach them how to live according to the calling of God, and train a new generation of Christian leaders. If the teens do not find the small gate and take the narrow path Jesus spoke about, then all of our planning sessions and programs and all of our time, energy, and resources that we spend are meaningless. We must be making disciples in every effort we make. Keep this key principle in your mind at all times.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
Worship/Devotional time<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#19171B;">A key component of every Christian’s life is their concept and practice of worship to God and personal devotional time. Because mankind’s relationship to God is of such importance and these two aspects of life are so vital to that relationship, it would be difficult to call a person a Christian who does not stay involved in some kind of devotional practice.<br>
                                       <br>
Often worship is thought of as something that the worshiper must benefit from or it isn’t of any value.We forget that worship is what we give to God; it is not for ourselves. It is our outward expression of thanksgiving, of what our relationship with God means to us. In the Bible we have a clear expression of this in the first chapters of Genesis, where God specifies the worship He expects. Abel worshipped according to God’s request, while Cain chose to worship according to his own desires. Today it is no different. For many today, worship is offering what we choose to offer, based on whatever we like or want, with little or no consideration of what God asks of us, and therefore our worship can be just as offensive as Cain’s was.<br>
                                       <br>
There are several components of worship; each must be carefully and prayerfully examined in our hearts. The music used, the prayers offered, the words spoken, the actions involved—do what brings glory of God. There can be no mixing of the profane under the guise of culture, modern trends, personal preference, or any other excuse.<br>
                                       <br>
Personal devotions are the time for connecting personally with Jesus. It’s the time for receiving what builds our spiritual strength and satisfies the innermost soul. Timeframes are of no importance here. The apostle says, “I die daily”—that is the only reference we have for time. Devotions need to take place daily; they may last a few minutes or hours. They may consist of short readings one day and long tearful arguments another day. They may begin early in the morning as conversations with God before we even get out of bed, and they may wrap up the day as we fall asleep in His trust.<br>
                                       <br>
A hurried lifestyle is no excuse to limit personal devotions. It was Martin Luther who probably best understood this; he said something like, “I have so much to do today that I must spend an extra hour on my knees to prepare for it.” Be sure to include in your programs some instruction and examples of worship and devotion to God. Even though the teens may see church worship, you can teach them the principles behind it and help them to form habits of personal devotion.<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#1F3763;">Camping and nature<br>
                                    </span><span style="color:#19171B;">Camping and other outdoor activities are a highlight in the programming of most youth groups. Be aware of some guidelines recognized by all who venture into this world of discovery that must be an integral part of our teaching and behavior. Pastor Robert Tyson, one of the church’s early youth directors, taught that if we are to be leaders of youth, we must become outdoors persons first. He meant that we must not only become skilled in the arts of camping and outdoor adventure, but we must also develop a strong appreciation for an ethic toward nature. <br>
                                       <br>
The true outdoors person is not a “Rambo” type who straps on a long knife and plows into the wild, imposing their presence and destroying the environment. Rather, they will blend in and become a part of this environment—they learn to “walk softly.” They follow the axiom, “Leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but pictures.” One of the goals of the Ambassador group in the outdoors is to leave a site in better, cleaner, and more natural condition than when they arrived.<br>
                                       <br>
Outdoor leaders familiarize themselves with every living thing and appreciate each species for what it is—a representation of the creative acts of God, another piece of the grand puzzle picturing the Great Controversy, each with lessons waiting to be learned. “He alone who recognizes in nature his Father’s handiwork, . . . learns from the things of nature their deepest lessons, and receives their highest ministry” (Education, 119–120).<br>

The first step in implementing the curriculum is to obtain the core materials. There is a Leader’s Guide and a Participant’s Guide (one for each participant) for each one of the seven modules. We advise that you approach the modules in the order that they appear in the outline below. You can order the necessary resources from the GC Youth Department, through your Conference Youth Department, or download it from www.gcyouthministries.org. <br>
                                       <br>
The Leader’s Guide for each module contains the leader’s instructions, which include an overview, outline, and objectives for each session for that module. The table below is a brief outline of the Ambassador curriculum and the key concepts and objectives for each of the seven modules/foundations.<br>

THE SAVIOUR MINGLED WITH MEN [WOMEN, AND CHILDREN] AS ONE WHO DESIRED THEIR GOOD. HE SHOWED HIS SYMPATHY FOR THEM, MINISTERED TO THEIR NEEDS, AND WON THEIR CONFIDENCE. THEN HE BADE THEM, ‘FOLLOW ME’.”<br>
Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 143<br>
                                       <br>
On the basis of empirical research, scientific studies and sociological findings, the New Testament understanding of the church and the writings of Ellen G. White, ten fundamental values have been defined that a church should deliberately and continuously develop and evaluate if it wants to be family of God in the biblical sense. <br>
                                       <br>
These values should be discussed regularly at church board meetings and will help churches to concentrate on core issues that foster the growth of the church as a spiritual home and safe sanctuary for people of all generations, cultures and social backgrounds. The ten iCOR values are not additional programs that a church simply needs to implement. They much rather nurture the commitment and attitude fostered by the church to be family of God and form an intergenerational community of believers in order to satisfy the spiritual needs of young people in a special way. These values form the foundation for further church activities and help the church to define and implement its individual goals.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(Galatians 3:26-29)<br>
Connecting churches strive to form authentic and loving relationships across generational, cultural and social boundaries. God is love, and as Father, Son and Holy Spirit is a relational God—and his church should also reflect this nature. Building healthy relationships is one of the most important and urgent tasks of the Christian church. The love lived out among the followers of Jesus is a central characteristic identifying them as belonging to God. It makes their faith authentic. It is fundamentally impossible to love God and ignore one’s fellow human beings. Christian fellowship must be built up and lived out; it is more than the mere gathering of several people in the same place to attend a spiritual program.<br>
                                       <br>
Connecting churches make conscious efforts to form authentic and loving relationships across generational, cultural and social boundaries and come in contact with people both in and outside the church. This is particularly important for the young people in the church, because it is essential for their spiritual growth that they have relevant relationships not just with their peers, but also with adults.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(James 2:14–16)<br>
Caring churches foster a loving attitude that reaches out to others with empathy and accepts them the way they are. They actively serve their good and support them in all areas of life.<br>
Genuine nurturing care fulfills most of the fundamental human needs. Those who experience that they are loved and accepted develop trust and become more open and receptive. Caring churches take care of their fellow human beings and build a supportive community because they see it as their mission to love as Jesus loved and to bring healing to others. Young people in particular need to experience a loving, caring and supportive faith community.<br>
                                       <br>
Nurturing care draws people into the mutual responsibility of taking care of each other. It doesn’t matter to other people how much good and correct knowledge we have, they need to experience it! Caring churches are committed to supporting those who have been entrusted to them in their spiritual growth so that one day these can say: “This is my church!” Authentic nurturing care includes both prayer and practical help of all kinds. A caring attitude makes churches sensitive to the spiritual and other diverse needs of their fellow human beings.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(1 Corinthians 12)<br>
Churches that encourage participation value the gifts and skills of their fellow human beings and create room for them to take part in forming all aspects of church life. In this way, they foster a sense of belonging and identification with the church.<br>
                                       <br>
Helping shape church life strengthens the feeling of belonging and identification with the church and its mission. This is particularly true for young people. They are filled with ideas, opinions and energy, but too often they are not given opportunities to apply these in the church. Studies show that youth consider the church to be relevant, but does the church consider the youth to be relevant?<br>
                                       <br>
Essentially, a feeling of belonging is fostered where one is included and can make a contribution. With young people in view, the Seventh-day Adventist Church leadership issued the following statement in 2007: “The reasons most frequently cited by persons who leave local church fellowship are found in the realm of relationships, the absence of a sense of belonging, and the lack of meaningful engagement in the local congregation and its mission” (“Conserving Membership Gains,” General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Executive Committee, 2007, paragraph 5). Churches would therefore be well-advised to encourage their members, young and old, as well as guests to actively participate in shaping the vision and mission of the church.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(Matthew 18:20)<br>
Churches understand worship as the daily practice of making the Gospel reality. They search for creative opportunities to celebrate worship in everyday life and are committed to making the Sabbath a meaningful experience.<br>
                                       <br>
Worship is not an event or program, but a way of life. It trusts that God is present and lets the biblical truth become reality in everyday life. The “children of God” do not just proclaim the Gospel, but also celebrate and live it out wherever they come together. Studies show that experiencing corporate worship, joy and reverence in singing, music, prayer and preaching has a positive effect on the spiritual life of an individual that extends into everyday living. <br>
                                       <br>
Churches that desire to grow in corporate worship are actively committed to making the Sabbath a meaningful experience and shaping worship in such a way that young people can also make a contribution and feel addressed by the services. “The religious exercises should be so planned and managed that they will be not only profitable, but so pleasant as to be positively attractive” (Ellen G. White, Testimony Treasures Vol. 2, p. 440). Corporate worship can be oriented on spiritual needs and concrete situations and purposes. But a loving, joyful and thankful attitude among those celebrating the worship service is more important than individual program elements.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(Matthew 28:18–20)<br>
Churches that teach the Word of God communicate in a relevant, creative and practical way.<br>
                                       <br>
People are looking for sound biblical teaching and preaching that is relevant for their lives. The “Valuegenesis Europe” (VGE) study shows that preaching that reaches young people is very important for their church experience. When they experience preaching that touches their hearts, they are eight times more likely to stay in the church compared to youth who do not make that experience. <br>
                                       <br>
Relevant preaching is possible when one is sensitive and open for the realities and spiritual needs in the lives of the people and talks with them about these issues. Because faith in Jesus comes from “hearing” (Romans 10:17), it is essential that Christian values and biblical teachings are communicated in a practical, authentic and creative way and Jesus is kept at the focus. Churches that make this a priority are also more likely to be relevant for guests. However, communicating faith is not limited to the sermon or one-sided preaching in a church context. Equally important are personal conversations and the creative communication of our faith in everyday situations (Deuteronomy 6:6–9).<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(Matthew 20:25–28)<br>
Mission and ministering always require an attitude of service. Serving churches follow the example of Jesus by ministering to the needs of others and seeking to discover new ways to serve.<br>
                                       <br>
“The church is organized for service” (Education, 268.6). It is a caring and serving community. When young people are asked what they feel is important for the church to be, many of them say it should make an impact in society. Particularly young people are ready to get involved in meaningful outreach activities that make a difference in the lives of their fellow human beings. Therefore, they should not just be invited to help carry them out, but also be included in developing and planning these activities. <br>
                                       <br>
Those who are actively involved can better identify themselves with the church and the Adventist faith. Today it is easier for people in the church to invite friends and acquaintances to help in ministries serving the community than just to come to worship services. When church and faith are relevant to society, young and old will also be more willing to talk with their friends and other people about their faith. The life of Jesus demonstrates how much proclaiming the Good News depends on a positive, open and serving attitude towards others.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(2 Corinthians 5:18–20)<br>
Reconciling and reconciled churches actively foster reconciliation and healing in the name of Jesus, both in the relationship to our heavenly Father and to each other.<br>
                                       <br>
Mission work in the “ministry of reconciliation” keeps Jesus at the focus, is respectful towards other people and takes them seriously. As ambassadors of reconciliation, we are ‘bridge builders’ who as representatives of Jesus invite others to be reconciled with God.<br>
Under the banner of reconciliation, everything involved in our outreach and evangelization is subordinate to the mission of healing and rebuilding a lost or broken relationship with God and helping people to find their own individual way to connect with our loving Father. <br>
                                       <br>
Churches committed to the “ministry of reconciliation” are aware of the fact that the invitation to be reconciled with God is only credible when they live out the experience themselves. It’s about the restoration of relationships. Ultimately, mission in the context of reconciliation makes it clear that the Good News is inseparably linked to the messenger and the Gospel as lived out practically in the church. Therefore, all members are called to be ambassadors for Jesus and let the Gospel become reality in their lives.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(Philippians 4:9)<br>
Churches that care about personally accompanying their children and youth in particular, but also adults in their walk of faith are committed to fostering spiritual mentoring relationships.<br>
                                       <br>
Jesus was a mentor for his disciples, just as Moses was for Joshua and Barnabas for Paul and Mark. Apart from their parents, young people in particular need adults who are relevant in their lives and serve as living role models. Therefore, churches not only foster informal intergenerational relationships, but specifically train mentors to be able to accompany others on their spiritual journey. “The classic definition of mentoring is that of an older experienced guide who is acceptable to the young person and who can help ease the transition to adulthood by a mix of support and challenge. In this sense it is a developmental relationship in which the young person is inducted into the world of adulthood” (Kate Philip, “Mentoring and Young People” in Encyclopedia of Informal Education, August 2000).<br>
                                       <br>
Youth who have relationships with caring adults are less likely to engage in at-risk behavior, are more self-confident and more likely to help others compared to those who do not have such relationships. Consequently, mentors in the church can help children, teenagers and youth, as well as newly baptized members and interested guests to grow spiritually and master the challenges of life. In the same way, young people can also be mentors for older people.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(Proverbs 9:8–10)<br>
Churches that are open for learning provide training opportunities for their members to develop individual gifts and skills and promote services and ministries in the church.<br>
                                       <br>
Learning is a fundamental principle of life, and where there is no more learning, there is stagnation. Jesus was respected as a Rabbi, that is, as a teacher, and his disciples can be considered his students. The Greek word for disciple (mathetes) comes from the world of education. Followers of Jesus are people in training, and training promotes growth. The real goal in the school of Jesus is actions and not just words and knowledge. Because training empowers people to develop and grow, the church should be a place of learning for all generations. <br>
                                       <br>
Young people are not the only ones who need structured, continuous education and support in the environment and daily life of the local church. Churches that place great importance on education are therefore committed to providing all members with the opportunity to grow in understanding, improve their individual gifts and continue to develop in service for God. They therefore encourage and support their members in the participation in internal and external training opportunities. The progress of a living community of faith thrives on the awareness that one is never finished learning.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">(Exodus 18:21–23)<br>
Strategical and purpose driven churches lead with a vision and passion, integrating the younger generation in the leadership activities of the church.<br>
                                       <br>
A strategic and goal-oriented church does not limit its attention to administrative processes. It is much rather intentionally missional and oriented on continued development, progress and growth in all areas. It has or develops a vision and a mission for its local community and is constantly seeking to involve all members—including the youth—in the continuous development, analysis and evaluation of the vision and goals. It constantly reminds all in the church of the vision and actively includes young people in the leadership activities of the church. <br>
                                       <br>
Just how seriously a church takes its young people is often revealed by how much youth are included at all levels of the leadership processes. When young people take part in the leadership, they will perceive the church as their church and actively shape the activities and the mission of the church. Value-oriented leadership is also marked by continuous and forward-looking consideration of the iCOR values and ways to actively promote and evaluate them in the daily activities of church life.<br>

                                    <span style="color:#000000;">iCOR is an instrument for a value-oriented church development designed to help churches recognize biblical values in daily church life and live them out together. iCOR was originally conceived by the Youth Ministry Department as a response to the realization that many of our youth leave the church and is based on the fact that dynamic churches after the New Testament model are not just important for youth. iCOR provides a good basis for helping people find a spiritual home in our churches and for sustainably promoting faith, mission and fellowship among the various generations and diverse cultures represented in our churches. In this sense, iCOR is a guide designed to aid churches in their efforts to be an extended family after the biblical model and make the love of God and the Gospel of Jesus concrete, living reality—relational, participatory, socially relevant. <br>
                                       <br>
iCOR is committed to the mission of Jesus to support people in holistic discipleship. iCOR therefore places value on practical and relevant communication of biblical teachings and Christian values, and at the same time is aware that the messenger is just as important as the message. For this reason, iCOR emphasizes service and reconciliation. Ultimately, the best mission work according to the biblical example is to be a church of the relational, redeeming and living God. <br>
                                       <br>
One fundamental premise behind the iCOR values is the conviction that God has placed great potential in each human being—independent of age, culture, gender or church membership. Therefore, iCOR would like to encourage churches to actively seek ways and possibilities for recognizing, stimulating and promoting this potential more fully, in order to learn from each other and grow together. <br>
                                       <br>
The iCOR values, ideas and resources are intended to help churches engage in dialog about these values, so that with God’s help, they may become more and more the spiritual home that God would like us to be for his children and the community in which we live. The research shows that above all the younger generation will be very thankful for that.<br>

Understanding the History, Philosophy, Vision, Objectives and Structure of Adventist Youth Ministry<br>
                           <br>
As a Senior Youth Leader, working with our youth can be the greatest source of joy and satisfaction as we see them grow in Jesus and become disciples of His. “The greatest sense of achievement in ministry comes when a youth leader sees young people enter onto a life-long relationship with God by inviting Jesus Christ to be Lord of their lives” (GC Youth Ministry Handbook 2005, p xiii). As the church continues to fulfill its prophetic divine mission from the Bible, the youth leader as well as the youth of the church need a clear understanding of the Adventist mission as it relates to being a prophetic church in these last days. Only then can the senior youth leader understand the prophetic role the youth department plays, in the work and mission of the church, and its prophetic existence in these last days.<br>

This module of study will look at the organizational structure of the Adventist church as a prophetic movement in these last days, and learn the role of the Adventist Youth Society in assisting the church to accomplish its mission. We will learn the history, philosophy, mission, objectives, and structure of the Adventist Youth Society. As a Senior youth leader, it is imperative for you and the youth of the church to understand why we exist as a department, how the department came into existence, and the role of the Adventist Youth Society in assisting the church to fulfill its mission.<br>

The Seventh-day Adventist church, firmly rooted in Revelation 14, is a prophetic movement called out by God in earth’s last days to prepare a people for the coming of Jesus Christ. In the 1850s, the embryonic denomination wrestled with the concept of how the church should be organized, and in 1861, prayerfully came up with the basic structure we have today, as shown by the diagram below.<br>

The Adventist Youth Department in a very real sense is also a prophetic movement within the church as can be seen in the church’s early history—most of the early pioneers and founders of the church were themselves young; Ellen Harmon was only 17 when she began receiving visions from God, and only 34 when the church was organized. The prophecy of Malachi 4, where the hearts of the fathers are to be turned to their children and the children’s hearts to their parents, can be seen being fulfilled within the youth department. Ellen White made a strong plea from Australia, December 19, 1892 to the church at large to begin having separate spiritual meetings for the boys and girls in their local churches. It read: “We have an army of youth today who can do much if they are properly directed and encouraged. We want our children to believe the truth. We want them to be blessed by God. We want them to act a part in well-organized plans for helping other youth. Let all be so trained that they may be so trained that they may rightly represent the truth, giving them reason of the hope that is within them, and honoring God in any branch of the work, where they are qualified to labor”<br>
(General Conference Bulletin, January 29, 30, 1893, p. 24).<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The first youth organization in the local Seventh-day Adventist church began in 1879 when two young boys, Harry Fenner, (16 years) and Luther Warren, (14 years) saw a need to plan missionary work, raise money for literature, and promote temperance in daily living. These meetings took place in Hazelton, Michigan, USA. Soon the girls pleaded to be included in the spiritual meetings and thus began the first Adventist youth organization, which was blessed by the local church. The parents of Luther Warren played an active role in molding and counseling this small group to meet their objectives. <br>
                           <br>
From 1893-1901 youth societies sprung up around the USA, and in 1901 the General Conference officially voted into existence the young people’s organization, under the Sabbath school department. At the 1907 General Conference Council at Gland, Switzerland, the church approved the formation of a Youth Department within the General Conference where elder M. E. Kern was elected the first GC Youth Director.<br>
                           <br>
Within the same year (1907) a group of church workers met to select a name for the department and draw up basic guidelines. The name finally agreed upon was “Seventh-day Adventist Young People’s Department of Missionary Volunteers.” Over the next two decades, passionate youth leaders developed the Junior Missionary Volunteer (JMV) programs and guidelines and youth camp philosophy, which encouraged handicrafts, woodcraft, trailing and camping as strong activities where the young people would connect with nature and spiritual truths from Bible. For more on the history of Adventist Youth Ministries please read the 2005 edition of the GC Youth Ministry Handbook, pages 5-10.<br>

                           <br>
History of the JMV Classes<br>
JMV classes were introduced within the department in 1922. <br>
...The first North American Division youth congress, held in San Francisco in 1947 with E. W. Dunbar as world youth director, drew thousands of youth. In 1969 the first World Youth Congress was held in Zurich, Switzerland, with Theodore Lucas as world youth director.<br>
                           <br>
The Character Classics Reading Plan (later changed to Encounter) was adopted in 1946. John Hancock organized the first conference-sponsored Pathfinder Club in Southeastern California Conference at Riverside, California in 1946. From 1947 to 1950 the Pathfinder program continued to develop in the Pacific Union Conference under the direction of J. R. Nelson, union youth director. Finally, the General Conference adopted the Pathfinder Club organization in 1950. (Senior Youth Ministry Handbook, also known as Foundations for Senior Youth Ministries (GCSYMH), 2013, p.124)<br>

                           <br>
History of the AY/AJY Classwork<br>
As youth engaged in JMV Society activities, some leaders felt the need to help them develop strong Christian characters and prepare for effective witnessing, so they would know how to do missionary work. The leaders studied the possibilities, including many helpful suggestions in the Spirit of Prophecy writings.<br>
A system of classes developed from that study and through observation of similar organizations emerging at that time. Class requirements included Bible and nature study, homemaking skills, outdoor activities, first aid, personal and home health, physical fitness, community service, and many different avenues of witnessing. These meaningful activities helped youth to find true happiness.<br>
Leaders envisioned an army of youth with talents and energies committed to Christ, an army with ranks filled by those whose hands would be ready to grasp any emergency and turn it to the glory of the great Master Guide.<br>
During the General Conference session in San Francisco, California in the spring of 1922, the work of the Junior Missionary Volunteer Society was greatly strengthened by the addition of what had become known as “progressive classwork.” Two classes were provided at that time, and youth leaders returned to their respective posts throughout the world, bringing new inspiration to the youth of many lands where the program had already spread.<br>
The 1927 General Conference Autumn Council in Chattanooga, Tennessee enlarged the Progressive Classwork to include three classes, Friend, Companion and Comrade, for junior youth and one class for senior youth and adults. C. Lester Bond joined the General Conference MV Department in 1928, and two major programs evolved that year: MV Honors and the Master Comrade Class—developed for senior youth and adults “who desired to prepare for junior leadership.” The first Master Comrade (later called Master Guide) was invested in 1931.<br>
The MV/JMV Classwork (later AY/AJY), designed to help youth physically, mentally, spiritually, and socially, proved to be a definite factor in character building, and has become a blessing in the lives of thousands. The formation of the MV Society and JMV Society was the beginning of the church’s answer to the inspired call to “do something for youth.” It was also an answer to the need of youth for involvement in spiritually stimulating church activities. (GCSYMH, 2013, p.125)<br>
                           <br>
Name Changes<br>
Over the years, the name of the young peoples’ department underwent various changes as the church saw the need to keep current with our youth who are ever changing in the outlook, goals, needs and values of their present generation. What began in 1907 as “Seventh-day Adventist Young People’s Department” (known as MV – Missionary Volunteers), changed to “Youth Department of Missionary Volunteers” in 1972. In 1978 the department name changed to “Adventist Youth” commonly known as AY department. Delegates at the 2005 General Conference Session voted the name, “Youth Ministries Department” which encompassed all the three age levels of youth ministry (e.g. Adventure Club, Pathfinder Club, and Senior (Young Adult) Youth Society. The 2015 General Conference session further adopted a name change to “Adventist Youth Ministries” (AYM).<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The basic philosophy of AYM is securely grounded in the Biblical revelation of who Jesus Christ is. The Bible reveals a loving God who created humanity in His own image, to have a loving personal relationship with Him. The fall of man brought a broken relationship, not only between humanity and God, but also between each other. God took the initiative to remedy the situation and sent His only Son to die in our place so that we might have a chance to see Him face-to-face again. Through His Son Jesus Christ, who visited earth as a human so that we could see more clearly, we can understand God’s love to us (Heb. 1:1-3).<br>
Jesus gave a clear picture of God and sent out His disciples to follow after His example, meeting lost sinners where they are, showing them a better life in the Father’s love and then making disciples of them to go and do the same, to hasten the soon return of Jesus Christ. Not only did Jesus show the Father’s immense love for humanity through “servant leadership” (Jn. 13:1-17), but He also showed them how to receive power to overcome sin in this world through the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus showed His disciples how to live a life in the Spirit and become disciples of the Kingdom of God in a sinful world. (Gane: 51-52) (Building Youth Ministries-A Foundational Guide). This is emphasized in the AY mission statement that seeks “to lead young people into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ and help them embrace His call to discipleship”. (p.132) “GCSYMH”. 2013)<br>
It is Jesus who is our model of “incarnational ministry” (e. g. allowing the character of Jesus and the power of Holy Spirit to be revealed in the life of our young people, thus becoming true disciples of His in this generation). Ellen White endorsed this model of incarnational ministry as a model for our youth to adopt in their Christian walk with Jesus when she said:<br>
“The youth are the objects of Satan’s special attacks; but kindness, courtesy, and the sympathy which flows from a heart filled with love to Jesus, will gain their confidence, and save them from many a snare of the enemy... There must be more study given to the problem of how to deal with the youth, more earnest prayer for the wisdom that is needed in dealing with minds... We should seek to enter into the feelings of the youth, sympathizing with them in their joys and sorrows, their conflicts and victories... We must meet them where they are if we would keep them... let us remember the claim of God upon us to make the path to heaven bright and attractive. (Ellen White, Gospel Workers (Washington, D. C.: Review &amp; Herald, 1948), 207-212, emphasis added.)<br>
                           <br>
Mission / Vision<br>
The AYM mission statement seeks “to lead young people into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ and help them embrace His call to discipleship”. This mission statement has become ultimate goal of the Adventist Youth Ministries department, that seeks to win, train, hold, and commission, young people for Christ.<br>
Barry Gane rightfully captured the very essence of the Vision/Mission of the AYM as stated in his book “Building Youth Ministries-A Foundational Guide”:<br>
“Youth ministry built on this model (life and ministry of Jesus) seeks to meet young people where they are, and to offer them pastoral care not only as spiritual guides, but also as counselors and friends, fellow pilgrims on a similar spiritual journey. With Jesus as our model we are called to ministry, a personal and relational ministry, that will involve a good deal of one to one time.” (Gane: 54-55) (Building Youth Ministries-A Foundational Guide).<br>
The AYM continues to work with the local church to fulfill God’s mandate to prepare a people for the soon return of Jesus Christ. “Adventist Youth Ministry is that work of the church that is conducted for, with, and by young people.” (Pastors and Elders Handbook for Youth Ministries, 2002, p. 2) We see that it is the youth themselves that need to be personally involved in fulfilling the mission of the department, displaying what our church leaders expect from every baptized member “Total Membership Involvement” in these times. In other words, the mission of Adventist Youth Ministries is basically one of: salvation, discipleship, and service, which is grounded deep in the biblical model of the early church’s mission in the book of Acts 2:42-47. There are four dynamic forces that undergirded the growth of the early church: grace, worship, community, service. These four dynamic forces are strongly interwoven into the work and mission of the youth department. It is a biblical ministry where the AYM Pledge is carried out, by the youth, to the youth, for the youth, with the youth.<br>
                           <br>
Objectives of the AYM<br>
As youth leaders plan the work for their youth in the local church, a clear understanding of the objectives of the AYM is of utmost importance. Ellen G. White in the late 1900s spelled out the key objectives for the department in a letter published in the Signs of the Times, May 29, 1893. Here she set forth the objectives for the department:<br>
a)To train the youth to work for other youth,<br>
b)To recruit the youth to help their church and “those who profess to be Sabbath-keepers”;<br>
c)To work “for those who are not of our faith”<br>
                           <br>
In seeking to reach these objectives, the youth are called upon:<br>
a)to pray together<br>
b)to study the Word together<br>
c)to fellowship together in Christian social interaction<br>
d)to act together in small groups to carry out well-laid plans for witnessing<br>
e)to develop tact and skill and talent in service to Jesus<br>
f)to encourage one another in spiritual growth<br>
                           <br>
In 1907, at the General Conference Council at Gland, Switzerland, M. E. Kern, the first elected youth director for the department, set out the following objectives, in harmony with those laid out above. They were:<br>
a)To raise the level of the devotional life of the young person<br>
b)To lift up the standard of attainment of the youth<br>
c)To educate and train youth for service<br>
d)To provide opportunities for outreach and service<br>
e)To teach the principles of stewardship<br>
f)To lead youth to discover their individual worth and develop and discover their spiritual gifts (GC Pastor’s and Elder’s Handbook for Youth Ministry, 2002:13)<br>
                           <br>
In response to these inspired directives and M. E. Kern’s expansion of E. G. White’s objectives for the department, the Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM) Department was also organized to give leadership training and to provide resource materials and evangelistic plans covering both the Junior Youth Ministries (JYM) and Senior Youth Ministries (SYM) in the local church. (“GCSYMH” 2013:127)<br>
                           <br>
Structure of Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM)<br>
AYM has two broad age groups that are broken into two dedicated subsets of ministries: Junior Youth, ages 6-15, and Senior Youth, ages 16-30+. These two subsets are further broken down into the following four (aged-related) ministries within the department.<br>
                           <br>
Junior Youth Ministries (JYM): Ages: 6-15 Includes:<br>
Adventurer Ministry (Ages 6-9)<br>
Strengthens parent-child relationships by providing weekly activities tuned into the psychological needs of this age group and also giving parents opportunities for learning parenting skills and enjoying special activities with their children. <br>
                           <br>
Pathfinder Ministry (Ages 10-15)<br>
Assists in the critical years of identity formation and adolescent transformation for boys and girls. Offering intentional activities of service and mission, Pathfinders guides the energy of young people to focus on their community.<br>
                           <br>
Senior Youth Ministries (SYM): Ages: 16-30+ Includes:<br>
Ambassador Ministry (Ages 16-21)<br>
Designed to strengthen the current senior youth ministry of the church. It challenges them to experience and share a personal relationship with Jesus; helps them develop a lifestyle that is consistent with their belief system; provides training in diverse vocational interests; and provides them with a safe environment for the wholesome development of lifelong friendships. (GCSYMH, 2013, p.9)<br>
                           <br>
Young Adult Ministry (Ages 22-30+)<br>
Engages the vitality of a generation sharing their living relationship with Jesus in work and life, recognizing the diverse demographic from those in education or work, married or single, and possibly parents. This critical ministry embraces empowering young adults for leadership, mentoring, evangelism, and healthy lives. Dartmouth, the human brain continues to grow and change into the early 20s. ‘We as a society deem an individual at the age of 18 ready for adult responsibility,’ she states. ‘Yet recent evidence suggests that our neuropsychological development is many years from being complete’ (Grossman, Lev, “They Just Won’t Grow Up,” Time, January 24, 2005, p. 42-53).<br>
“As a result of this physical reality, your teenager is caught between two worlds: that of being a child (with simple, incomplete thinking and a minimal data bank of experience), and that of being an adult (with more complete, mature thinking and a bigger data bank). <br>
Youth can and do act like adults at times. This is normal. And they can and do act childishly at times. This is also normal.” The entire above section, including the Baird quote, was taken from http://www.focusonthefamily.com/parenting/teens/letting-go-of-your-teen/why-parents-want-tocontrol-their-teens<br>
                           <br>
Given this important fact, youth tend to think that they’ve got it all taken care of, but things such as rightly perceiving the world and managing their emotions are also things that they’re still working on and are a consequence of their brains’ not being complete yet. Knowing this will help us keep patience with these creative, lovable, but often frustrating young humans.<br>
Next, we must understand that youth culture and societal systems really are different and distinct in important ways from the adult or mainstream culture around them. Today, even in remote regions of the world, the digital age is creeping in, and in all developed nations, youth have more autonomy, at least in a digital sense, than ever before. Many of their parents, particularly in nations where the digital age has come more recently, do not understand computers, the internet, social media, cell phones, and newer forms of entertainment as well as their children do. They may not completely realize that their children are inhabiting a different world than their own. Getting inside that <br>
                           <br>
These objectives still form the major objectives of the AYM today, and while each ministry above has adapted these objectives to suit their age-related ministry, any local church AYM that consistently endeavors to attain these objectives will reap success and become a mighty influence in the local church and its territory around.<br>
                           <br>
Adventurers<br>
Our colors represent our mission. We’re bold, bright, and confident. Blue represents Heaven. Blue is the color of the sky and a reminder of the heavenly realm Scarlet in the Bible represents blood and redemption. The life of man is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11) and Christ’s blood atonement is necessary for the redemption of man. Green represents growing and blooming where one is planted. It is representative of a Christian life that produces good fruit and finds rest in Christ. White represents righteousness because of its purity of color and light. It points to the Righteous One and the righteousness He imputes to all who come to Him in faith.<br>
                           <br>
Pathfinders<br>
a.Red reminds us of Christ and His sacrifice. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). “Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God” (Rom. 12: 1).<br>
b.Three sides represent completeness of the Trinity -- Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Tripod of education: Mental Crafts and Honors, Physical Campouts, work bee, health focus Spiritual Outreach and personal spiritual development.<br>
c.Gold represents excellence “I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich” (Rev. 3:18). The Pathfinder Club has high standards to help build strong character for the kingdom of heaven.<br>
d.Shield represents protection. In the Scripture God is often called the shield of His people. (Protection) “Fear not... I am thy shield” (Gen. 15:1) “Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.” (Eph. 6:16)<br>
e.White represents purity. “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment” (Rev. 3:5). We desire to have the purity and righteousness of Christ’s life in our lives.<br>
f.Blue represents loyalty. It is the purpose of the Pathfinder Club to help teach us to be loyal to: Our God in heaven. Our parents. Our church. Loyalty is defined as a reflection of the character of our True Master Guide.<br>
g.Sword represents the Bible. The sword is used in warfare. A battle is always won by offense. We are in a battle against sin, and our weapon is the Word of God. The sword of the Spirit is the Word of God. (see Eph. 6:17) <br>
h.Inverted Triangle represents the order of importance Jesus taught which is contrary to that taught by the world. Sacrificing of one’s self by placing the needs of others ahead of our own.<br>
                           <br>
Ambassadors<br>
a.The cross in the logo points to the fact that Jesus’ sacrifice is the center of a relationship with Him. The cross on the earth is symbolic of His sacrifice, giving us hope of a new and better life both here on earth through the concept of servant leadership and through an earth made new at His return.<br>
b.The open book is the Word of God, the foundation for our faith, knowledge, and lifestyle. It is open because it’s a message for us to internalize as our constant guide and companion. It is also for sharing with all who will freely receive it. <br>
c.The graded colors of yellow to orange represent the dawn of eternal life that follows the darkness of our temporal experience on this sinful earth.<br>
                           <br>
Young Adults<br>
The gospel of Jesus represented by the cross is at the center of Young Adult Ministry. Colossians 1:17 The three angels message of Revelation 14:6-12, represents an urgent plea to the world. A message to be carried by the Young adults to all the world in their generation. The half globe represents the world field that should receive the three angels message. The message is for every tongue, nation, kindred. NO discrimination. Blue represents loyalty. It is the purpose of the Young Adult Ministry to teach loyalty to God, the mission and the church. Loyalty is defined as a reflection of the character of Jesus. Yellow is the color of sunshine. It’s associated with joy, happiness, intellect, courage and energy.<br>
The Ideals of the Adventist Youth Ministry AYM<br>
While the senior AYM church youth leader endeavors to fulfill the AYM key objectives laid out above, the ideals of the AYM find their expression and fulfillment in living out the senior AYM Aim, Mission, Motto, and Pledge of the department.<br>
Aim<br>
“The Advent message to all the world in my generation.”<br>
Mission<br>
“To lead young people in a saving relationship with Jesus and help them embrace his call to discipleship.”<br>
Motto<br>
“The love of Christ compels me.”<br>
Pledge<br>
“Loving the Lord Jesus, I promise to take an active part in the work of the Adventist Youth Ministries, doing what I can to help others and to finish the work of the gospel in all the world.”<br>
(For a detailed explanation of Ideals of the senior AYM see page129-133 in the book, Foundations for Senior Youth Ministries)<br>

The senior youth leader in the AYM who remains in constant harmony with AYM mission statement, and ideals as expressed in the aim, mission, motto, and pledge, will reap success and become a mighty influence in the local church and its territory around the world. Ellen. G. White expressed it well when she said:<br>
“To save from sin and guide into service:” this true and only motive, so complete and impressive, was adopted during the 1926 General Conference session. To obtain the salvation of the youth it is necessary to give them every possible opportunity to participate in all Adventist youth activities. By keeping youth actively preparing for more efficient service, they are protected from evil. It is necessary to place them in some activity as soon as they are ready. “Seeking the good of others is the way in which true happiness can be found.” (Counsels on Stewardship, p. 24)<br>

Understanding Youth<br>
                           <br>
The youth of today live in a world different from that of their parents and the adults of the church when they were the same age. All youth—from time immemorial—dream, but today our youth live in a society that digitally makes their dreams seem “real,” and transports them into a virtual world full of vision. The fact that they live in a virtual world encourages them to develop a lifestyle in accordance with the great mutation of this world. This way of living is often decried and misunderstood by the adults of the church. As a youth leader, the time has come to seek a better understanding of the mentality of today’s youth in order to make them feel understood and feel that they belong to God’s family. This will in turn help them to improve their spiritual growth.<br>

In this module we will study to understand Jesus’ example with regards to cultural accommodation, discover the challenges faced by young people, understand the world in which they live, and know the steps in the process of being acquainted with the youth environment and entering into it with them.<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Monday, December 04, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
First we must realize this important point: <br>
“Teen brains aren’t finished yet. The frontal lobe of the brain — the part responsible for decision-making and reasoning — isn’t fully developed until a person’s early-to-mid-twenties. “According to Abigail Baird of the Laboratory for Adolescent Studies at Dartmouth, the human brain continues to grow and change into the early 20s. ‘We as a society deem an individual at the age of 18 ready for adult responsibility,’ she states. ‘Yet recent evidence suggests that our neuropsychological development is many years from being complete’ (Grossman, Lev, “They Just Won’t Grow Up,” Time, January 24, 2005, p. 42-53).<br>
                           <br>
“As a result of this physical reality, your teenager is caught between two worlds: that of being a child (with simple, incomplete thinking and a minimal data bank of experience), and that of being an adult (with more complete, mature thinking and a bigger data bank). Youth can and do act like adults at times. This is normal. And they can and do act childishly at times. This is also normal.” <br>
                           <br>
The entire above section, including the Baird quote, was taken from http://www.focusonthefamily.com/parenting/teens/letting-go-of-your-teen/why-parents-want-tocontrol-their-teens Given this important fact, youth tend to think that they’ve got it all taken care of, but things such as rightly perceiving the world and managing their emotions are also things that they’re still working on and are a consequence of their brains’ not being complete yet. Knowing this will help us keep patience with these creative, lovable, but often frustrating young humans.<br>
                           <br>
Next, we must understand that youth culture and societal systems really are different and distinct in important ways from the adult or mainstream culture around them. Today, even in remote regions of the world, the digital age is creeping in, and in all developed nations, youth have more autonomy, at least in a digital sense, than ever before. Many of their parents, particularly in nations where the digital age has come more recently, do not understand computers, the internet, social media, cell phones, and newer forms of entertainment as well as their children do. They may not completely realize that their children are inhabiting a different world than their own. Getting inside that new world is a necessity for today’s youth leader. We must see, and encourage them to see, that youth and adult cultures are both independent of each other, and at the same time inseparable.<br>
                           <br>
We need them, and yes, they still need us. As we seek to understand the challenges and feelings of youth, it can seem like a daunting task. Can we adequately generalize youth and their culture in a way that makes sense to us and to them? Has the negative media attention affected the way youth and young adults are treated…do they have a chip on their shoulder?<br>
                           <br>
In this seminar we are seeking to find methods and ways to help us honestly explore their values and concerns in the context of the church and a developmental relationship with God and the church. We must find ways to re-engage the youth and provide a productive social bond between youth and adults in the church. We must find ways to show them that they are taken seriously and keep them (or pull them back) into the larger church community.<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Monday, December 04, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The Bible teaches that to win people, it is important to understand their environment and their lifestyle and enter into that environment and lifestyle with them.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>a.The Best Example of this is Jesus Himself.</em><br>
In order to understand the situation of humanity and to demonstrate His love for us, Jesus first left the unimaginably different environment of heaven to come to earth and live as a human in a specific society and time, wearing their clothes, eating their food, listening to their music, and learning their trades. He came down to meet our situation and lived in the context of fallen mortals overwhelmed by the consequences of sin. This not only allowed Him to understand human suffering, it also made it possible for Him to demonstrate His love for humanity. This is well explained by Paul in Philippians 2: 5-7:<br>
                           <br>
“Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross”.<br>
                           <br>
While here, Jesus mingled with people in order to understand them. He then taught them new things that were opposite from what they had been taught. For instance, He broke the local social codes (based on a narrow understanding of actual Bible passages) in spending time with people Jewish society deemed unacceptable. <br>
                           <br>
“As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him. And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” But when he heard it, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners” (Matt 9: 10-13).<br>
                           <br>
In Luke 15, the result of mingling is clear. It is said that those whom the Pharisees called “sinners” were drawn to Jesus because he stooped low to their level and understood their situation. Only then could He begin to pull them up to His level.<br>
                           <br>
“Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, “This man receives sinners and eats with them” (Luke 15:1, 2).<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>b.To win people and make himself understood</em><br>
“To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some” (1 Corinthians 9:20-23).<br>
                           <br>
It could be noted that many Christians would feel better becoming “as one under the law” than “as one outside the law.” They might face less opposition and rebuke, too. <br>
                           <br>
In verse 23, Paul gives the reasons why it is important to mingle and adopt the culture of people. “I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.”<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Monday, December 04, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Ellen White gives the successful method Jesus used to save souls. This method applies equally well in the context of youth. <br>
                           <br>
“Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Savior mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me’” (Christian Service, p. 119).<br>
                           <br>
This method of understanding the mentality of youth requires a genuine sympathy.<br>
                           <br>
“The youth are objects of Satan’s special attacks; and the manifestation of kindness, courtesy, tender sympathy, and love, will often work the salvation of those who are under the temptations of the evil one” (Pastoral Ministry, p. 275).<br>
                           <br>
She urged that we adapt religion to the youth in order to attract them.<br>
“They should make their religion attractive to the youth who come within the sphere of their influence” (Christian Education, p. 24). A good understanding of youth culture can lead them to use the potential God gave them in the service of the church.<br>
                           <br>
“The minds of many of the youth are rich in talents which are put to no available use, because they have lacked opportunity to develop them. Their physical powers have been strengthened by exercise; but the faculties of the mind lie hidden, because the discernment and God given tact of the educator have not been exercised in bringing them into use. Aids to self-development must be given to the youth; they must be drawn out, stimulated, encouraged, and urged to action” (ibid., p. 30).<br>

                           <em>a. Understand The Youth’s Environment</em><br>
Young people have a capacity of rapidly adapting to the social climate in which they are immersed. This is how God created them—intending that they be surrounded by a positive, godly environment and that they soak it in and then add their own creativity to enrich it. But today’s world has twisted this capacity of youth. With young people, things change according to the economic and social transformations of their environment. These affect their desires, their needs, their sensibilities, their relationships, their way of dressing, their appearance, and their understanding of spiritual lifestyle.<br>
                           <br>
They tend to build their identity in conformity with the world around them. Today, the younger generations are characterized by their use of modern communication technologies, bringing what is commonly called “the virtual world.” This environment provides access to many opportunities that previous generations did not have, and undoubtedly affects the moral and emotional lives of young people. It shapes the concerns and the needs of young people, making them different from those of adults. <br>
                           <br>
In many churches, young people have the strong impression that the church does not know what to do with them. It is not uncommon to find young people isolating themselves from the group and raising critiques about what is being done. For instance, they complain about the way the music is played, the way programs are run, and so on. In short, today’s youth live in a world different from that of adults. Even though the latter feel they are doing well, the young people do not see things this way.<br>
A journey into the world of the youth is necessary in order to understand, accept, and guide them. This will allow the church to detect and satisfy the needs they may have so as to integrate them and make them feel part of the church family.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>b. Understand The Youth’s Sources of Influence</em><br>
                           <strong>i. Family. </strong><br>
From babyhood on, especially as long as the youth is at home, the family remains the first source of influence. This influence is marked by two main things: the training given by parents and, especially, the impact of social life at home.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>ii. School. </strong><br>
The school exerts an impact on the life of young people. They are transformed by what they learn, by their teachers, and also by their friends. The kind of school they attend can make a difference in their behavior.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>iii. Community.</strong> <br>
The young person is influenced by his or her community; and since their tendency is to be in groups, they are bound to find one in their environment. The neighborhood, friends and everything that come into play in their relational life has an impact on the young person’s life. This can vary by how deeply a given country’s life is community-oriented, but it is true in all countries.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>4. Mass Media. </strong><br>
Today, mass media, and especially television, internet, and smartphones, are influencing young people and transforming their way of seeing things and apprehending the world.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>c. Understand The Desires of Young People</em><br>
It may not always seem like it, but young people are looking for adults capable of responding to their moral, social, and spiritual needs.<br>
                           <br>
i. Young people are seeking recognition as part of the family of the church<br>
                           <br>
ii. Young people are looking for adults and leaders with whom they can confidently communicate the realities of their lives<br>
                           <br>
iii. Young people are looking for framework and opportunity in which they can say what they think without being punished or disqualified<br>
                           <br>
4. Young people have visions and ambitions that are often different from what is usually done. They look for new ways and innovations and seek out leaders capable of bringing changes that take their opinions into account.<br>
                           <br>
5. Young people love their church and want to see it evolve and grow. They are willing to defend her in their environment so far as the actions of the church are worth being proud of.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>d. Entering in The Youth’s Universe</em><br>
To be able to understand the youth culture, there is a need of entering into their world. Here are some ways:<br>
                           <br>
i. Organize frequent meetings to discuss the problems they face while asking their opinions. Do not taboo their ideas and points of view. Also arrange one-on-one time with each youth.<br>
                           <br>
ii. Tolerate young people’s language and behavior. What they say and how they say it must to be tolerated. Give them the opportunity to freely express themselves while gradually drawing their attention to any improper conducts they may exhibit. This allows you to understand their world while at the same time allowing them to ponder their deeds.<br>
                           <br>
iii. Allow young people to express their emotions and feelings. Generally, negative ways of acting and reacting stem from internal resentments they have.<br>
                           <br>
iv. Make space for listening-based dialogue. Make it a habit to find time to listen to young people instead of talking to them.<br>
                           <br>
v. Organize informal programs and activities with the youth. Find time to just play. It’s important to them, and it’s still important to adults, too.<br>
                           <br>
It is necessary to know that young people, in general, are not interested in hearing adults’ experiences of yesteryears especially when these experiences have nothing in common with the present. Rather they yearn to see condescending adults and leaders ready to understand and accept them in the context of their world. It is all about seeing leaders identifying with the struggles and hopes of young people to better understand and minister to them. If you listen to their stories, they may listen to yours, if you find relevant ones and learn to tell the stories “in their language.”<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>e. Creating A Framework for Youth Involvement</em><br>
Once immersed in the culture of young people, it is necessary to create space for them to feel at home. You will need to:<br>
                           <br>
i. Create an environment where young people feel accepted and important. This will allow them to take ownership of the church.<br>
                           <br>
ii. Encourage young people to create informal meetings. They feel more energized when they create their own groups.<br>
                           <br>
iii. Organize forums for exchange and conversation where young people are called upon to make decisions. Preach less and put them into exchange groups.<br>
                           <br>
iv. Create diverse experiences where young people have the opportunity to bring their ideas to life with youth-oriented music and other arts.<br>
                           <br>
v. Frequently allow young people to lead programs. This allows them to take initiatives. When young people hear and see other young people in action, they will know there is room for their age group.<br>
                           <br>
vi. Create intergenerational activities. This allows for a crossroads of cultures for mutual understanding of both adult and young people’s world. Everybody will learn from each other and appreciate one another.<br>

If Jesus was able to come close to us in order to understand us in the context of our world, we can also do the same with our youth.<br>
                           <br>
•Learn to be compassionate in your dealings with youth so as to express authentic sympathy and kindness to the young people around you.<br>
•Ask the Lord for wisdom and passion for youth work so as to minister to the hearts of the young<br>
•Remember the goal is to help them develop a close relationship with Christ.<br>

Part 1<br>
Today at the seminar, try answering the questions below. Keep your answers in a safe place at home or in your office; you will need them when completing <br>
                           <br>
Part 2 later.<br>
1.Two factors that most influence the youth of your church<br>
2.The musical trend of the youth in your church<br>
3.The value placed on the church by the youth<br>
4.The leisure activities of the youth<br>
5.Their favorite media<br>
6.The influence of church leaders on them<br>
7.To whom they talk about their problems with confidence<br>
8.The main complaints about the life of the church<br>
9.The heroes they would like to resemble<br>
10.Their understanding of Christian living<br>
                           <br>
Part 2<br>
Next, use the methods outlined above to get involved with the youth of your church for a quarter. During this time, find out how close you were in your original answers to the statements--without interrogating the youth. The aim is to crosscheck the depth of your knowledge vis-à-vis youth-adult relationships. If you were mostly correct with your Part 1 answers, congratulations. If not, you know what you need to work on, and no doubt you have come much closer during the quarter of learning what your youth really think about and how they feel.<br>

The Need for Specialized Youth Ministry<br>
                           <br>
Biblical Basis for Specialized Youth Ministry<br>
During our research for a biblical basis for youth ministry, our attention was drawn to two elements that could be considered as biblical anchors for youth ministry.<br>
                           <br>
a.The first one is to “Love the Lord Your God…” (Deuteronomy 6:5) as a foundational element of personal spiritual growth. It was to be taught in Israel by parents to their children from birth until adulthood. It is considered in the New Testament as the greatest commandment (Matthew 22:37, 38) with “love your neighbor” as second to it. The outcome should then be a good connection with the Creator and respect for other human beings. It is important to grasp that youth ministry starts with the home in partnership with parents and is extended to the church family with other leaders.<br>
                           <br>
b.The second element is found in 1 Corinthians 12:12-26 where the Apostle Paul highlights the importance and value of every part of the human body, describing the church as the body of Christ. Paul uses this metaphor to indicate that there is a need for diversity in the body which is the community of believers. He goes on to say that there is also a need for interdependence among the members and that all members are important to the proper function of the body.<br>
                           <br>
Everyone is needed and has something important to share. We should be comfortable advocating specialized youth ministry because Paul’s metaphor of “human body” gives us room to value and integrate all parts of the body irrespective of age, income, social status, family structure, gender, and physical characteristics. This is a challenge for the church as a community and for the leaders, but isn’t this exactly what the church is all about, the body of Christ?<br>

This module of study will seek to gain a basic understanding of why we need specialized youth ministries and how they have functioned up to now. We will seek ways to further develop our youth ministries today with models based on growing awareness of the developmental needs of youth, intergenerational dynamics, and an understanding of cultural and societal trends that are impacting youth.<br>

Over the years, the leadership of the church has sought to accommodate the youth and establish new structures and protocols to answer to the need wherever it was possible. But it did not manage to slow the lack of interest of young people in church life. This recurrent situation that is affecting youth ministry all over has caused some youth professionals to engage in serious analysis to understand the reasons our youth are drifting away. In the process, the leadership of the Adventist church in North America has come up with a study that was conducted by the BARNA GROUP and that we must take seriously into consideration.<br>
                           <br>
They estimated that 80 percent of those reared in the church will be “disengaged” by the time they are 29. Barna Group president David Kinnaman describes the reality in stark terms: “Imagine a group photo of all the students who come to your church in a typical year. <br>
                           <br>
Take a big fat marker and cross out three out of every four faces. That’s the probable toll of spiritual disengagement as students navigate the next two decades.” We must be alarmed by such a result and adopt a course of action to try to reduce or reverse the trend and create a safe environment where our youth can grow and learn to develop a close relationship with Christ.<br>
                           <br>
How Can We Make the Youth Ministry More Relevant to Our Young People Today?<br>
                           <br>
We agree that the main goal of youth ministry should be exactly what it is for the adult in the community. Therefore, Adventist Youth Ministry which is a specialized ministry of the church should <br>
                           <br>
1.Seek to address expressed needs of young people in their own environment and respond to them as they are, and <br>
                           <br>
2.Incorporate them into the fellowship of the church as a caring Christian community. But when we do a reality check we are faced with some troubling facts among our youth community. It is very important to undertake diligently a course of action to alert the leaders worldwide to make youth ministry a priority on their strategic planning. Let us take time to read an excerpt of what Ministry Magazine (an international journal for pastors) reported about the survey of Adventist millennials done by the BARNA GROUP in 2014.<br>
                           <br>
“In his book “You Lost Me,” Barna Group’s president, David Kinnaman, details six perceptual grievances that millennials in general tend to harbor against “the church” (meaning any church of any denomination) as a cultural institution. These grievances hold that the church is intolerant of doubt, elitist in its relationships, anti-science in its beliefs, overprotective of its members, shallow in its teachings, and repressive of differences.<br>
                           <br>
In surveying of Adventist millennials in particular, these grievances hold true to an even greater extent when it comes to the Adventist young adult perceptions of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. <br>
                           <br>
-Doubtless U.S. 10% Adventist - 28%<br>
-Exclusive U.S. 22% Adventist - 34%<br>
-Anti-science U.S. 25% Adventist - 47%<br>
-Overprotective U.S. 23% Adventist - 36%<br>
-Shallow U.S. 24% Adventist - 29%<br>
-Repressive U.S. 25% Adventist - 37%<br>
                           <br>
The percentages of respondents who say their experiences fit these descriptions are higher than the national norms—for all six perceptions. For example, while one in four of United States (U.S.) millennials with a Christian background say that Christianity in America is repressive of differences, almost four in ten of Adventist millennials say this is true of Adventist churches.<br>
                           <br>
Data: Comparing U.S. millennials with a Christian background to Adventist millennials, percentages of respondents who “agree strongly” that each descriptor describes their church experience. <br>
                           <br>
Reason #1 Churches seem overprotective.<br>
Reason#2 Teens’ and twenty-somethings’ experience of Christianity is shallow.<br>
Reason #3 Churches come across as antagonistic to science.<br>
Reason #4 Young Christians’ church experiences related to sexuality are often simplistic, judgmental.<br>
Reason #5 They wrestle with the exclusive nature of Christianity.<br>
Reason #6 The church feels unfriendly to those who doubt.<br>

Henceforth, Youth Ministry should be a place of choice to engage the youth in conversation, debate and open study, to tackle those issues and help them see how they can connect their faith in Christ to the reality they live daily. Our youth need a safe haven where they can voice their concerns and challenges and express their doubts and questionings without the fear of being judged or rejected.<br>
                           <br>
In the book Education, page 17, Ellen White says: “Every human being, created in the image of God, is endowed with a power akin to that of the Creator—individuality, power to think and to do. The men in whom this power is developed are the men who bear responsibilities, who are leaders in enterprise, and who influence character. It is the work of true education to develop this power, to train the youth to be thinkers, and not mere reflectors of other men’s thought” (emphasis added). This can occur only when youth leaders are intentional about creating that safe zone where the youth can be challenged in their thinking and exposed to a sound biblical worldview in a positive, open, and welcoming way. It is important that youth leaders do not limit themselves to a unique way of doing ministry but explore different avenues and approaches more adapted to the millennials. <br>
                           <br>
Dr. Tim Elmore in his book iY Generation identifies today’s youth as an “over-connected, overprotected and overserved generation” and gives some practical solutions to their greatest challenges. Based on his experience leading millennials, he has created an acronym that summarizes and identifies what makes this generation so unique. He calls them EPIC generation. These are four characteristics that any youth leader should be familiar with if they want fully and effectively lead the millennial workforce of the future at all levels. EPIC generation stands for:<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>E---Experiential</strong><br>
Millennials are experiential in their learning. They aren’t looking for a polished and professional speaker with an impressive PowerPoint in a classroom to learn from. They want to learn from someone walking alongside them who has experience in what they are doing.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>P---Participatory</strong><br>
Dr. Elmore brings up a good point with this characteristic. He reminds us that this generation has grown up in an age of entertainment and technology that is interwoven together. When a millennial can see how their action affects an outcome, they get fired up and motivated to make the outcome even better.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>I---Image Rich</strong><br>
Between Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, millennials have images every time they look at their phone. They have also grown up with music videos, websites, digital cameras, and cell phones. Special attention should be placed on that specific trend that has become a vital part of millennials’ lifestyle. As leaders, if we are not on social media or not able to communicate with simple “smiley face icons”, better known as emojis, we are missing out on a connection with the largest generation in communities today.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>C---Connected</strong><br>
More than any other generation in the past, millennials are connected. They are connected socially and technologically. With their cell phones, they have a constant connection with the world around us and their circle of friends. These generations understand the immense power of connection. They know that with one tweet or one snapchat they could go viral. Anything they say or do could be viewed by millions upon millions of people across the globe. The question that comes to our mind should be, how can we work efficiently with this EPIC generation in our churches, in our local youth ministries? <br>
                           <br>
Primarily, we need to recognize that while this social media is an awesome technology at the core of our youth culture today, there is a great responsibility that is attached to it and which must be emphasized in our activities. Secondly, as youth leaders, we can use this age of connection to bring about a movement of Christ’s disciples and fellowship across the globe in which youth reach out to other youth in any part of the world, where they are facing challenges of all kinds. “God wants the youth to become men [and women] of earnest mind, to be prepared for action in His noble work and fitted to bear responsibilities” (Messages to Young People, p. 21).<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Finally, let us remember that the church is the body of Christ and that each part plays a vital and unique role in its functioning. That takes us to the idea that as a church we should be intentional in integrating every specific group within our church family. The word family is pivotal in our understanding of Christian faith. <br>
                           <br>
As a family, the focus should be on developing healthful relationships amongst the different generations that are intermingled in the composition of our community. We should make it a priority to pay attention to our youth and put our emphasis on their spiritual development and their integration in the community.<br>
                           <br>
It is urgent for our leaders to pray and seek God’s guidance in creating bridges between the youth and the adults that will help pass on experience, knowledge, and expertise. At the same time, we must initiate an authentic intergenerational dialogue, give them room to express creativity, and facilitate access to leadership positions within our communities in a meaningful way. The outcome for our youth would be a greater sense of belonging and ownership of their community and an active part in the great commission.<br>
                           <br>
“In order that the work may go forward in all its branches, God calls for youthful vigor, zeal, and courage. He has chosen the youth to aid in the advancement of His cause. To plan with clear mind and execute with courageous hands demands fresh, uncrippled energies. Young men and women are invited to give God the strength of their youth, that through the exercise of their powers, through keen thought and vigorous action, they may bring gory to Him and salvation to their fellow-men” (Gospel Workers, p. 67).<br>
                           <br>
How?<br>
David Kinnaman, President of the Barna Group, in his study of millennials has identified the following five areas as key elements that contribute in helping young adult stay connected to their communities. <br>
                           <br>
1. Make room for meaningful relationships: Those who stayed were twice as likely to have a close personal friendship with an adult inside the church (59% of those who stayed report such a friendship versus 31% among those who are no longer active)<br>
                           <br>
2. Teach cultural discernment: A second important ministry outcome for today’s millennials is helping them develop discernment skills—especially in understanding and interpreting today’s culture…<br>
                           <br>
3. Make reverse mentoring a priority: Young people want to be taken seriously today—not for some distant future leadership position. In their eyes, institutional church life is too hierarchical. And they’re not interested in earning their way to the top so much as they’re wanting to put their gifts and skills to work for the local church in the present—not future—tense. Mrs. White addresses this, too: “The youth must be impressed with the idea that they are trusted. They have a sense of honor, and they want to be respected, and it is their right” (Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 114).<br>
                           <br>
4. Embrace the potency of vocational discipleship: Teach them a more potent theology of vocation or calling. Millennials who have remained active are three times more likely than dropouts to say they learned to view their gifts and passions as part of God’s calling (45% versus 17%).<br>
                           <br>
5. Facilitate connection with Jesus: Church communities can help millennials generate a lasting faith by facilitating a deeper sense of intimacy with God. The version of “‘Jesus in a vacuum’ that is often packaged for young people doesn’t last long compared to faith in Christ that is not compartmentalized but wholly integrated into all areas of life.”<br>
“Millennials need the help of faithful believers from older generations if they are to make sense of it all and move meaningfully forward in their life and faith.” These new elements in addition to previous curriculum in youth ministry could equip leaders with more tools and reflection tracks to minister to the needs of our youth across the globe. <br>
                           <br>
The youth leaders should see that:<br>
•Young people should be involved more often in intergenerational activities that are intentionally inclusive and participative <br>
•Always keep in mind the essential needs of youth in your strategic planning<br>
•Empower them and meet them where they are in terms of their personal issues and spiritual growth<br>
•Create opportunities to mobilize their skills in useful projects for their local communities as well as abroad.<br>
•Encourage interaction between generations; it will help create synergy, mutual enrichment, and spiritual fellowship. “Young men should have broad ideas, wise plans, that they may make the most of their opportunities, catch the inspiration and courage that animated the apostles” (Messages to Young People, p. 24).<br>

During another study conducted with a sample of young adults, three positive fields were identified and should be considered as relevant to improve the development of relations and help the youth better connect with the rest of the community. <br>
                           <br>
                           <em>1. Intergenerational relationships. </em><br>
The first key is intergenerational relationships. For so many of our respondents, their relationship with the church was determined by their relationship with older members. It was noted that most local churches do not need to figure out how to make intergenerational relationships happen; they are already happening. However, it is important to note that these intergenerational relationships can work both ways—both negatively and positively. The goal for local leadership can be to create a church culture that reinforces the positive interactions and reduces the negative interactions.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>2. Forgiveness and acceptance. </em><br>
Nothing drives teenagers and young adults from the church faster than being rejected, and nothing draws them in faster than being accepted. Both are currently happening in spades in Adventist churches around North America. Unfortunately, this issue is not exclusive to the USA. It is present in various continents and regions of the world including developing countries. Luke 6:36 defines Matthew 5:48’s admonition to be “perfect as God is perfect” as “be merciful as your Father is merciful.”<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>3. Platforms for sharing. </em><br>
There is a power in experiencing God’s love and strength. There is a power in sharing that experience with others. And there is a power in hearing the story of another person’s encounter with God. We need to remember as well that developing connections with a younger generation can help older adults feel a greater sense of fulfillment. In fact, linking older adults with youth can provide advantages for both groups.<br>

We live in a society in crisis; our youth are facing great challenges and a significant number of them are leaving the church. Nevertheless, youth ministry is still relevant today and can play a decisive role in their spiritual growth. Leaders should be open to address the issues and the needs of the youth from an intentional, inclusive, intergenerational perspective. This generation needs to be embraced through authentic relationships, generous mentoring, and a strong connection with Jesus The various studies mentioned in this presentation, and the issues raised, may not fully correspond to the experience of all communities throughout the world church. However, it is interesting to take note of it and to continue the reflection according to the cultural specificities and challenges of your own region.<br>
                           <br>
The influence of social media is gaining ground more and more and providing access to countries that are difficult for the gospel to enter. I humbly invite all youth leaders to initiate diligently a conversation with the leadership of their local churches to create an awareness that is paramount to the development of our youth ministry. Youth leaders should also engage young people in open discussion to encourage them to put God first in their lives and become active witnesses of Christ in everything they do.<br>

This is the key point to note: as a Christian who influences other Christians, the Youth Ministry Leader will lead not just through speech, but essentially through the whole life. In following the example of Jesus, he or she becomes an example to young followers. For a leader, this connection takes place in the concept of discipleship. We are all disciples of Christ. Besides Lord and Savior, He is our example. We are not called “Christians” by mere grammatical distinction. To be a Christian is to follow Christ. To be a Christian leader is, first and foremost, to follow the example of Christ so that those who follow us may be automatically following Christ. Paul’s invitation to his readers to be his imitators, just as he was an imitator of Christ (1 Cor. 4:16; 11:1), gives us the exact dimension of the leader’s relationship with Christ. The Youth Ministry Leader needs to be a human language translation of what Jesus is.<br>

This module of study will look at the youth leader, first as a student and follower of Christ—the foundation of all Christian life and especially of leadership, then as a spiritual leader, mentor, and friend to the youth under the leader’s guidance. We will consider some parameters necessary to maintain both respect and compassionate friendship.<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Youth leadership in a church setting does not include the classic, earthly concepts of leadership alone, but transcends these concepts, living out the biblical model of godly leadership as exemplified for us by Christ and by the human leaders He trained while He was here. <br>
The first commitment of a youth leader, therefore, must be to Christ. Before we lead, we must follow. Every leader is a sheep of the supreme Pastor, following the guidance of the Great Shepherd. Yet we are also more than sheep. When we analyze all the beings created on planet earth, we find that general sociability is a relatively common feature of created beings, animals included. We as humans can be friends with people, and we can also love our pets. <br>
                           <br>
However, spirituality is a distinctive feature of human beings. We can have relationship not only with created beings, but also with the Creator. Our pets may love us, but when we stop to pray, we will not find our pets praying. So, as Christian leaders we do not act like a feline leading a pack of other felines. In the words of God, “Not by force, nor by violence, but by my Spirit” (Zech. 4:6). We subordinate our social relationships to the biblical principles of Christian spirituality. And the Bible is very clear in determining that our spirituality is about our connection to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Therefore, the leader must be a follower of Christ first. Fundamental commitment to Christianity must guide the life of the youth leader. Only then will we be able to develop leadership in the right context. A true Christian leader will naturally develop a Christ-like leadership style. <br>
                           <br>
It is interesting to remember that when God established the Hebrews as a nation, He said that the Hebrews would be “a holy nation, a kingdom of priests” (Ex. 19:6). The apostle Peter, in 1 Peter 2:9, repeats this concept to Christians, calling us a “royal priesthood.” Paul recalls throughout his writings that this priesthood/ministry is “all believers.” It should be remembered that one of the functions of priests was, through the whole ritual of the sanctuary, to bring to human understanding the reality of God’s Plan of Redemption. The priest translated into human language the realities of what God was doing for His people, thus revealing the character of God.<br>
                           <br>
We do this translating in the context of wholeness as healthy human beings. Spirituality drives the rhythm and quality of our social interactions. We are human beings, and the Bible understands the human being as a total, complete being. A biblical approach to anthropology considers the human being holistically: we are physical, mental, and spiritual. All these layers of our being are interdependent. They do not function properly if they are not well equalized, supplied, and interconnected.<br>
                           <br>
All of them are important, but there is an order of factors that changes the final product: “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God” (Matt. 6:33). When Jesus spoke these words, He was establishing the supremacy of spirituality as fuel for all areas of our lives. The success of our spirituality is the ballast to the success of everything else. For a Christian leader, spirituality is the driving and regulating agent of all the other layers in our nature. They are the fruits of a balanced spirituality that will produce balanced relationships.<br>

However, it is not enough to be a Christian leader; you need to be aware of whom you are intending to lead. When we speak of the young, we are talking about those who are at the forefront of the greatest social changes today. It is the young who receive the greatest burden of influences different from those of the church. Whether it is in the university environment, in relationships, or in the work environment of the first job. Everywhere, a “brave new world” unfolds before their eyes. It is the privilege of the youth leader to be a guide for this phase of life. But this privilege brings with it a responsibility: to have a contextualized awareness of the needs of the young, providing them the opportunity to experience a real Christianity relevant to the time and context in which they live.<br>
                           <br>
The youth leader needs to understand that providing a real and relevant experience does not mean falling into the trap of giving the youth only what they want. As the Bible and our own experience remind us, the human heart is not always trustworthy. It is necessary to provide what youth really need: a satisfying spiritual experience. We often turn youth groups into mere entertainment when we forget that helping the young to create real connections with God can only take place in a context of contagious spirituality.<br>
                           <br>
The youth of today are constantly searching for models.<br>
There are those who think that the greatest difficulty in leading youth lies in the fact that there is a natural challenge of youth to the proposed models. Indeed, since youth and young people represent the greatest expression of change in society, it is not surprising that in the context of an individualist, relativistic, postmodern society, in which any absolute imposed truth is questioned, the young tend to question everything and everyone. But whoever understands this understands that it is also a complete proof that the young are not willing to follow just any kind of leadership.<br>
                           <br>
The basic fact is that young people are pragmatic, that is, they tend to believe not in what someone says to be true, not in what someone says works. They tend to credit what they see that works. Maybe this is the true issue. In fact, Adventist Christianity is very beautiful in theory, but only works in practice. The youth’s experience with the church must be permeated with something real, practical, and effective. Otherwise, mere theory (however beautiful, interesting, and logical) produces no change in life.<br>
                           <br>
Let’s look at a culinary example: The youth leader can be seen as a “chef” in the kitchen. Imagine a chef in front of hungry clients. If he starts discoursing about the nutritional value of food, it will inform his clients, but it will not solve the hunger issue. If he tells a testament about when he has tasted a particular food, and how tasty that food was, he will surely create the desire for it in his customers, but it will not satisfy their hunger. No matter how much you discourse, the reality is that the chef will only solve the hunger issue of his clients if he goes into action and prepares the proposed food.<br>
                           <br>
So, it is with the leader. We need to materialize our concepts. Make your whole theory of leadership a practice that nurtures your followers. The young need to feel the real benefits of what the leader is proposing. If they realize that it works in the leader’s life, they will believe that it can work in their lives. Be honest about the questions you had when you were their age, and the questions you still have now. Let them understand that God doesn’t answer every single question, take away every doubt, or “fix” every situation. God’s promise is to be here—to be God with Us, and to help, support, and strengthen us through every challenge. Help them to begin to look at the complex problems and challenges and excitements of this “brave new world” as possibilities in God’s plan for their own personal lives. They need not either turn away from every new thing (as they sometimes see older folks do), nor run after it (as their friends might). They can stop and ask, “Is this a new thing God can use in my life and help me use to benefit the lives of others? And if so, how?” Take time with them, talking out the practicalities of the bright ideas they have.<br>
                           <br>
They are also willing to follow leaders who are real<br>
Now it is understood: For Christianity to be seen to function well in the life of the leader does not presuppose the perfection of the leader. One need not be perfect to be followed; as a matter of fact, young people are far less likely to follow someone who is supposedly perfect. They know very well that nobody is. Idealizing perfect leaders is idealizing the humanly impossible. <br>
                           <br>
A leader who inspires a young person is not one absolutely immune to errors, failures, and misunderstandings. What inspires a young person is, rather, one who has the wisdom, resilience, and perseverance to learn from one’s own mistakes, and find biblical solutions to practical issues. Sometimes the very fact of seeing a leader falter and then tell the truth about it, including asking forgiveness if necessary, is the turning point for a youth who is having trouble committing to Christ. It wasn’t Peter’s failure that qualified him to feed Jesus’ lambs, but it was most assuredly his recognition of his failure, his sorrow over it, and his humble repentance. (See John 21.)<br>
                           <br>
If you can succeed in modeling all of life—not every personal detail, just a well-rounded honesty in presenting all sides of human life with its struggles, dilemmas, and the solutions that the Bible proposes. If you can show that you are using what you are “selling,” you will surely inspire the young to follow your example. Not because you are perfect, but because you are able to present, in genuine practice, a solution path to issues, dilemmas, and challenges that are common to all. <br>
                           <br>
When the young can identify with the story of a leader, with the failures of a leader, with the struggles of a leader, with the dilemmas of a leader, they will identify with the solutions found by the leader. “Be my imitators as I am the imitator of Christ,” said the apostle Paul, a royal leader of the early Church who never concealed the reality of his struggles, nor did he hide the way to his victory.<br>
                           <br>
When we read Paul’s affliction in Romans 7 (“The good that I want to do, I cannot do it, but the evil that I want to avoid, that, when I see, I have done it ...”), who is alive who cannot identify with this fight? But at the same time, when Paul states his conviction that he can do everything in the one who strengthens him (Phil. 4:13), when he says that which he used to consider valuable he now regards as rubbish compared to the sublimity of the knowledge of Christ (Phil. 3:8), when he says that he learned to be happy and satisfied in whatever situation he faced (Phil. 4:11-13), Paul inspires us all to the certainty that if he succeeded, we can succeed as well. Paul was a real leader. And real leaders inspire their followers. Young people will follow real leaders.<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Sunday, December 03, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
It is true of all leaders that those whose followers see them as friends, also, will follow more willingly, but nowhere is this truer than among young people. Remember that (though they may not think so) they are still children in some important ways. Their brains are still developing, their judgment is still inconsistent, their attention spans are still shorter than they will be. A leader who is their friend will have far more influence over them.<br>
                           <br>
However, this can enter some tricky territory. Some youth leaders, in an attempt to be a friend and to be liked, go far beyond true godly leadership, entering into youthful high spirits to a point that loses respect and does not give them the well-rounded example we have seen so clearly laid out above.<br>
                           <br>
The young already know what constitutes a true friend. They know a friend who really cares, for instance, will not only refuse to join them in activities that are unwise, but will seek to prevent them from doing them, too. A true friend will not cover up or lie for a friend and will tell the truth in love in a way that superficial friends—or aloof leaders—never can. They are not seeking those who are in authority over them to be their “buddies.” But they are seeking loving friendship.<br>
                           <br>
Ellen White has this to say:<br>
“The true teacher can impart to his pupils few gifts so valuable as the gift of his own companionship. It is true of men and women, and how much more of youth and children, that only as we come in touch through sympathy can we understand them; and we need to understand in order most effectively to benefit. To strengthen the tie of sympathy between teacher and student there are few means that count so much as pleasant association together outside the schoolroom. In some schools the teacher is always with his pupils in their hours of recreation. He unites in their pursuits, accompanies them in their excursions, and seems to make himself one with them.<br>
                           <br>
Well would it be for our schools were this practice more generally followed. The sacrifice demanded of the teacher would be great, but he would reap a rich reward. (ED 212; this is in the chapter, “Recreation,” which would be helpful to read in full).<br>
                           <br>
Most youth programs include some form of recreation and activity, and those that do not, should. Any wholesome physical activity and recreation is good for youth, and good for strengthening the ties between them and their leaders. But best of all is a physical activity which is actually tied to the lesson at hand. Young people learn deep truths far more easily, and the lessons stay in their minds longer, when the lesson is attached to physical activity. This is the way to embody—literally, to put into the body—God’s truths.<br>
                           <br>
Seek out their company, enter into their interests, learn what this particular group already enjoys. Recognize and honor differences in interests and seek to help them also learn to enter into each other’s interests. Then use these interests to embody the lessons you wish to impart. You can often find good resources online using keywords like “team building activities on [faith, or teamwork, or kindness, or whatever you wish to teach at the moment].”<br>
                           <br>
Don’t forget one of your best resources is your youth themselves. Ask them what would be a good way to actively embody the lesson for the day or week. You will be surprised, not only at the creative ideas they come up with, but at how much you will learn from them.<br>
                           <br>
One of the most important things we can learn from coming close to our youth is that they are each unique, very different from each other, and each require different treatment. Education, page 280, points out that the vacillating and ease-loving will need encouragement and assistance; the discouraged need sympathy and appreciation to create confidence. The stern (though never harsh) treatment that a strong-willed rebellious one needs would be seriously destructive to a timid one.<br>

To summarize, a youth leader who has a strong commitment to Christ, who embraces and embodies biblical and spiritual disciplines, and who leads by clear and honest example will be a model that will inspire young followers to commit to Christ as well. This is the most effective form of leadership.<br>
                           <br>
Practice these things and devote yourself to them so that your progress is seen by all. This was what Paul sought to convey as a principle of leadership to the young Timothy when he wrote: “Recommend and teach these things. Do not let anyone despise you for being young. But for those who believe, be an example in the manner of speech, in the way of acting, in love, in faith, and in purity. As you await my arrival, devote yourself to public reading of the Holy Scriptures, to the preaching of the gospel, and to Christian teaching. Do not neglect the gift that you have, which God gave you when the prophets of the Church spoke, and the group of elders put their hands on you. Take care of yourself and be careful what you teach. Keep doing this, for thus you will save both yourself and those who listen” (1 Timothy 4:11-16).<br>

Apart from the AY department, there is little space for young people in the different organs of the church, and many adults are reluctant to change that by giving up any of their positions to youth. Yet, in many churches, young people make up the bulk of our membership. Statistics show a percentage of 60 to 90 in some parts of the world.<br>
                           <br>
Where they are not given a job to do, or even a say in how things are done, young people are less and less interested in the life of the church because they find it rather suitable for older people and leaders. The older ones are worried about losing youth, and yet the need for commitment and involvement of young people in the life of the church is the most effective means of developing their spiritual life and preserving it. When they feel part of the ecclesiastical structure, they will have a sense of belonging and they will remain in the church.<br>
                           <br>
It is time for leaders to seize the moment by recognizing the spiritual gifts of the youth and elevating them to positions of leadership as they are trained for them and develop the abilities. We need to have a plan in place for passing on the baton of mission and leadership. It must be an intentional effort and a thorough promotion and advocacy by the youth leader to the church leadership. The youth want to belong. They have a right to belong. We can help them do that.<br>

This module of the seminar will seek to develop a “Pass it On” philosophy. We will:<br>
                           <br>
•Understand the need to “pass it on” to the youth in all sectors of the Church.<br>
•Know the scriptural bases of involving the youth in the development of the church<br>
•Know the steps to follow in the process of using young people for better results.<br>
The youth will be the leaders of the future, ready or not; why not get them ready now, rather than merely dropping the church in their laps when we are no longer here?<br>

The Importance of Empowering Youth and Giving Them Responsibilities<br>
More than ever before, young people remain important to the growth of a community. The psalmist says: “Let our sons in their youth be as grown-up plants, and our daughters as corner pillars fashioned as for a palace” (Ps. 144:12). Young people must be trusted because there is life in them. The wise man declares: “Strength is the glory of young people” (Proverbs 20:29).<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>Leading Through Good Mentoring</em></strong><br>
The Bible speaks about the importance of drivers in the personal development. In Hebrews 13: 7, it is said that the mentor leaves an impact and a behavior to imitate:<br>
                           <br>
“Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.” Adults in churches have a part to play in helping the younger ones grow and imitate them so that they can have the necessary discernment to move forward.<br>
                           <br>
In the Bible, young people are presented in a positive way and their physical, mental and moral qualities are highlighted. They are considered as the equals of their elders. In fact, in biblical times, a Jewish young person was considered to become an adult in the spiritual realm of life at 12 or 13. From that point on, they were usually apprenticed to a person experienced in whatever their life work was to be, so that they were completely ready to take over even something as serious as priesthood at 30. Jesus began His official ministry at 30, but He began doing spiritual guidance as needed, even to temple leaders, at 12. The spiritual work to be done by elders is the same as that of the youth’s. <br>
                           <br>
“Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity” (1 Timothy 5.1-2). Young people have deep spiritual abilities. They have the same spiritual potentialities as adults. “I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God dwells in you, and you have conquered the evil” (1 John 2:14). Certainly, the Apostle was inspired by the books of proverbs which confirmed that young people are strong. This force is at once physical, moral, and spiritual. “Strength is the glory of young men” (Proverbs 20:29).<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
First, it would behoove us to remember that our denomination was founded by young people. At 54, Joseph Bates was the “father figure” of the group. The others were in their late teens and twenties. Their hearts were on fire for God in a way that tends to fade in age. The Spirit of Prophecy shows the importance of the emphasis to be given to youth. “Let not the youth be ignored; let them share in the labors and responsibility. Let them feel they are part of the act in helping and blessing others” (6T, p.435).<br>
                           <br>
Within a few decades, we lost a lot of our young people through our negligence (and it’s still going on today). “Very much has been lost to the cause of God because of inattention to the young. Ministers of the gospel should form a happy acquaintance with the youth of their congregations” (Pastoral Ministry, p. 275).<br>
                           <br>
There is a need for mentors who can be accepted by young people. “We should seek to enter into the feeling of the youth, sympathizing with them in their joys and sorrows, their conflicts and victories. Jesus did not remain in heaven, away from the sorrowing and sinful; He came down to this world, that He might become acquainted with the weakness, the suffering, and the temptations of the fallen race” (Gospel Workers, p. 209).<br>
                           <br>
It is important to give responsibilities to the youth as they can be used by God to accomplish great things. “God wants the youth to become men of earnest mind, to be prepared for action in His noble work, and fitted to bear responsibilities” (Messages to Young People, p. 21).<br>
That is why Ellen White makes this urgent appeal: “We must manifest confidence in our young men…” (Christian Education, p. 206).<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The main reason older adults are reluctant to allow youth to lead is because they are inexperienced. This is true. They must be taught and given responsibilities as they show aptitude. This is how they gain experience. We need to remember, we, too, started out young and inexperienced.<br>
                           <br>
Youth empowerment is of paramount importance as it allows for young people to grow up with skills. The aim is to enable them to participate in the life and development of the church by helping them grow in knowledge and aptitude. In this case, the youth are allowed to take initiatives, given a share of authority, taught to make decisions and implement what is best for them in the church.<br>
                           <br>
The aim here is to enable young people develop their ability to take initiatives and participate in the development of the church. Young people can be a key and a lever for the development of the kingdom of God, whether for evangelism or within the church. David Wilkerson said, and I am convinced: “Young people are a part of the church today, but all the leaders of tomorrow.”<br>
                           <br>
In order to become good leaders of tomorrow, the youth must be part of the church organization of today. They should be integrated into the present life of the church. There is, therefore, a need to position young people on the right path so they can have the necessary discernment to move forward.<br>
                           <br>
However, this does not merely mean teaching them to do all the things we already do, in the ways that we do them. The other reason older adults fear to give youth responsibilities is that they may have different ideas than ours. Good! We must learn to listen to and welcome their ideas. In the same way that we are asking them to learn from us how to discern the working of the Spirit and whether a given idea will be for the greater good of the congregation and community, so we need to learn from them how to listen “outside of our own boxes” of long-ingrained habits and culture.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>Need of Good Mentoring</em></strong><br>
Mentoring is an intentional relationship that is created between a less experienced person and an experienced one. The experienced person thus becomes a growth model for the inexperienced one. According to David Clutterbuck “A mentor is a more experienced individual willing to share knowledge with someone less experienced in a relationship of mutual trust” (Encyclopedia of Strategic Leadership and Management, p.1177). Mentoring is, therefore, a means of self-development. It is a way of helping the mentor develop himself and develop the other. It is not a ready-made lesson, but a potential for young people to develop through mentor orientation.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>What does mentoring involve?</em></strong><br>
                           <em>a Spiritual accompaniment. </em><br>
The mentor is committed to guiding and providing spiritual direction to the young person by leading them to adopt a life based on Christ and be committed to the spiritual activities of the Church. For example, praying with the youth, including them in personal prayer time, and, importantly, allowing them to see the way the mentor deals with challenges and struggles that come into his or her life.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>b. Physical accompaniment. </em><br>
The mentor tries to help the young person in their physical development. Find out what physical activities interest the mentee and join them in doing those. Encourage them, too, to learn new ways of being active. Walk together, jog together, clean up a road or park or stream together. Show them ways that physical activity can be helpful to those around them, not only to their own health.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>c. Moral accompaniment. </em><br>
The mentor helps the young person “cleanse his way” (Psalms 119:9). A mentor is worse than useless if he or she is not already a committed Christian, dedicated to living a life close to Jesus’ side, which will therefore be worthy of emulation. As we already studied, this doesn’t mean being perfect. The mentee will learn the most by seeing how a faulty human humbly lives by holding onto Christ in all situations. Find out what your mentee believes his or her strengths and weaknesses are, and work together on ways to deepen the strengths and shore up the weaknesses. The mentor can be a strong help in situations of peer pressure, for instance, especially if the parents are not filling this role, for whatever reason. One thing you will both be reminded of is that people are stronger together.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>d. Social support. </em><br>
The mentor must assist the young person in creating and maintaining healthy relationships. Our young people are in the most tumultuous period of their lives as they figure out who they really are. They are likely somewhere in the process of choosing partners, from first beginning to think about the opposite sex to seeking to learn whether God has a mate for them, and if not, how to live pure lives as singles. <br>
                           <br>
This may be their central concern, but you are in a position to help them to understand that only whole individuals can have healthy marriages, and whole individuals must have strong relationships in all spheres of life—from their siblings, parents, and extended families to the church family relationships, and including community, school, and work relationships outside the church. If the salt never leaves the shaker, it won’t be much use to God. <br>
                           <br>
Some of the older young people are already parents, as well, and that leads to a whole new level of mentoring. In order to succeed in mentoring, one must be able to go through the monitoring stages. The feeling of belonging will begin when young people find in adults the people on whom they can rely, able to guide them and help them acquire the necessary capacities for leading.<br>
                           <br>
In our particular context, the mentoring relationship would be between a present church leader and a young person who is interested in becoming a church leader. The relationship should be based on mutual interest—for example, a young musician should mentor with, say, a choir director or music minister, while one who may someday want to be a pastor could mentor with a pastor or elder, and one who is good with children can mentor with a Sabbath School leader or superintendent. The mentee can assist, then gradually take on more responsibility until he or she is prepared to hold an actual office in the area of interest.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>Try the youth in the church</em></strong><br>
Care must be taken to avoid underestimating the quality of the content that must be taught young people. The key to drive the machine of the church must be given to the youth. Once in motion, they can, and they will make the machine their personal property, so be sure they know how to drive. As they grow in ability and understanding, show them all the complexity of running a church. Help them see how to lovingly deal with conflict. Let them try things. And let them make mistakes without being judged or rejected. If they have a strong mentor, they will be able to withstand mistakes and will increasingly be able to discern where they went wrong and what to do differently next time. If you don’t know how to fail, you will never succeed.<br>
                           <br>
A sense of belonging makes the church a family where the youth find their place. In the same way that children don’t run away from their families so long as they feel they belong and maintain lifelong love and commitment to their families even after they grow up, so the young people will remain in the denomination when they feel they are part of the family. They may move to other congregations as they grow—in fact, the best outcome would be their starting new churches! But they will always belong. And the home church of their childhood and youth will retain a special glow even if they move away, because that is where they learned to truly follow Christ into abundant life, and into the ministry He had planned for them.<br>

a. The integration of young people begins with a strong will of the community to welcome them. There should be a willingness to welcome young people. They need to feel connected, appreciated, expected, and respected. <br>

                           <br>
f. Appoint young people in diverse positions of the church and train them to perform. They will do better and better each time they try.<br>
                           <br>
The attraction of young people to church services depends on the quality of the program, the opportunities they will be offered, and the training they have received. Integrating young people into church life requires the taking of responsibility.<br>

Young people have plenty of strength, energy, and ideas, and as they usually have time they can commit themselves fully (and free of charge) to the church. The sooner the young person feels needed and important, the more loyal they will become, and the more difficult it will be for them to leave the church.<br>

The senior youth leader is an integral part of the local church. He/she should work with the youth, their parents, the pastor, and volunteers to develop and implement a yearly plan with regular social, educational, spiritual and/or mission-oriented events meant to develop and maintain a vibrant program. Along with being fun and welcoming, this will also help to build a sense of community within the youth of the church, provide opportunities for both spiritual and social development, and help them connect with one another while growing in their faith. <br>
                           <br>
Since the local church is the rightful hub of youth ministry, the plans of the youth council should consider the initiatives of the Division, Union, and Conference. One of the greatest challenges facing the local youth leader is the responsibility of yearly planning, while endeavoring to be faithful to the Ideals of the AYM as expressed in the Aim, motto, pledge and objectives. <br>
                           <br>
This has discouraged many leaders, even sometimes causing them to give up and feel that they have failed as a youth leader. In order to be faithful to the AYM aim (“The Advent message to all the world in my generation.”) which is in keeping to the church’s mandate: “to preach the everlasting gospel to a perishing world in these last days”, the youth leader needs to become purposeful in adopting a balanced yearly plan model that will accomplish the AYM aim, motto, pledge and AYM objectives.<br>

This module will seek to assist the leader to plan a yearly model for the youth of the church, while implementing the key AYM objectives of the local church within the four dynamic areas that grew the early New Testament church (growth, worship, community, and service). It will stress the fact that AYM primarily focuses on Jesus, the Master Youth Leader. It will also stress the need to incorporate annually the major youth objectives of their conference, union, and division. The model will also seek to assist the leader to implement the current re-visioning of the GC AYM department to save our youth through the initiatives of “Reach In, Reach Out, Reach Up”.<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The youth leader needs to understand that it all begins with a focus on Jesus as the Master Leader who has given us a basic model to follow that transcends time. Christ’s life on earth gives the true model to save lost youth and usher them into the kingdom of God, modeling them into disciples of Christ, while living in this sinful world. <br>
                           <br>
Christ’s method of fulfilling His mission on earth was very purposeful and practical. Likewise, there is a need for youth leaders to become purposeful in the way we lead our youth. Becoming purposeful involves a sense of urgency in the way we live and work. What made Jesus successful was His connection with heaven to carry out His mission. <br>
                           <br>
The promise Jesus gave to His disciples before His accession to heaven is exactly the same promise youth leaders can accept today as His last day disciples hastening His soon coming. “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (Acts 1:8)<br>
                           <br>
The power that Jesus received from heaven to fulfill His mission came from the Holy Spirit and this same power is offered to youth leaders in their mission for their local church youth. Just as Jesus was empowered through the presence of the Holy Spirit, every youth leader needs this empowerment to develop a yearly youth model in their local church. <br>
                           <br>
In seeking to develop a sustaining yearly model for the youth, and model them into disciples for Jesus, we need to look at the life of Jesus and discover His secret to making disciples. The lifestyle of Jesus reveals the key concepts that form the basic areas of a local AYM program.<br>

Luke 6: 12-17 A Day in The Life of Jesus<br>
A day in the life of Jesus (e. g. Luke 6:12-17) reveals the same four biblical dynamic forces that helped the early church grow in Acts 2:42-47, and which we want to grow our youth programs. They are Spiritual Development, Building Community, Worship, and Missions. <br>
                           <br>
1.Verse 12: “He went out on the mountainside to pray.” He spent the first hours of His day in communion with the Father. We will identify that as PERSONAL SPIRITUALITY/DISCIPLESHIP.<br>
                           <br>
2.Verse 13: “When the morning came he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them.” Strengthened by His communion with the Father, He next sought the company of His twelve disciples. The Christian was never meant to live in isolation; God is community. Jesus showed us the way to COMMUNITY.<br>
                           <br>
3.Verse 17: “...he went down with them . . . and a great number of people ... had come to hear him and be healed.” Together, Jesus and His disciples spent the rest of the day in service, in the proclamation and demonstration of the Kingdom of God. This is true SERVICE AND MISSION.<br>
                           <br>
Acts 2:42-47 A Day in the Lives of the Early Christians<br>
                           <br>
Gane in his book “Building Youth Ministries-A Foundational Guide,” outlined the Biblical model of these four dynamic forces of church growth, as found in Acts 2:42-47. These forces need to become the core areas of ministry for our youth in the local church, with its programs and training centered around them year-after-year (Gane, p. 52-53).<br>
                           <br>
The four dynamic forces were grace, service, worship, and community. These four forces are clearly seen in the life of the early church and under-girded the rapid growth of the New Testament church community.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>1. Grace</em><br>
The free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ to sinners, who don’t deserve it. Gane stresses that Adventist Youth Ministry must include an intentional focus on God’s saving acts in history in such a way as to meet the needs of the young people at their stage of development. Youth ministry built on this model seeks to meet young people where they are, and through love and spiritual care, lead them into a saving relationship that recognizes and fully accepts the astonishing, free gift of God’s grace to them personally.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>2. Worship</em><br>
The celebration of God’s gift in praises to Him in formal church services, small groups, and individual daily lifestyle. This is carried out Gane in his book “Building Youth Ministries-A Foundational Guide,” outlined the Biblical model of these four dynamic forces of church growth, as found in Acts 2:42-47. These forces need to become the core areas of ministry for our youth in the local church, with its programs and training centered around them year-after-year (Gane, p. 52-53). The four dynamic forces were grace, service, worship, and community. These four forces are clearly seen in the life of the early church and under-girded the rapid growth of the New Testament church community.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>2. Worship</em><br>
The celebration of God’s gift in praises to Him in formal church services, small groups, and individual daily lifestyle. This is carried out through prayer, singing, praise, and thanksgiving. These practices build a rich spiritual life which goes with the young person far beyond weekly worship services or AY meetings. They learn that while following Jesus today does not literally mean to be with Him in the same way as His first disciples could, the priorities and intentions, the heart and inner attitudes of modern disciples are forever the same. A disciple wants to be like the Master and the disciple reorders the priorities of life in order to make discipleship possible. Jesus says that the Scriptures testify of Him and no discipleship is possible without spending time with Him through the meditation upon His Word. The Word, made alive by the Holy Spirit, will shape and transform the heart and life of the disciple to be like the master (Psalm 1:1-3). The whole life will become worship.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>3. Community</em><br>
Relationships bonded together in an atmosphere of warmth, love, and acceptance, where self is laid aside for the good of others. As, in the early church, believers were nurtured through the Word and teachings of the apostles. So here, young believers are welcomed into a community that reflects love, support, and unity as a window on the kingdom of God. In this community, no one is left out and everyone is cared for. In this community, there will be people at all levels on their journey with God. Some might be totally committed to Him, others might have no interest in spiritual things at all. Our task is to journey with all of them and to minister to them wherever they find themselves on the spectrum of faith. This will lead our youth to do the same as they grow in faith.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>4. Service</em><br>
The early church was intentional about expanding the kingdom of Jesus and extending the good news of a life in Christ and the grace He gives to everyone, everywhere, all the time. In the same way, service and mission are the heartbeat of your youth group/small group. Your outreach methods and activities will depend on your circumstances, the needs of the community, the resources that you and your youth group have, the spiritual gifts of your team, and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. <br>
                           <br>
Whatever shape or form your service/mission takes, it should always represent the ultimate objective for the existence of your ministry. Bear in mind the prophetic counsel given to us through inspiration: “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Savior mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, “Follow Me” (Ministry of Healing, p. 143). These four dynamic forces (GCSYMH, p. 29) need to become the foundation of youth programming.<br>

Youth Ministry Programming Cycle Model for The Local Church (Gcsymh, P. 30)<br>
This youth ministry cycle is presented in order of steps 1-5. While this is the order recommended, your youth ministry cycle does not have to follow this particular order, if your circumstances do not allow. For example, if your ministry is structured into small groups, number 2 would not be part of your cycle; however, you could bring elements of number 1 into your small groups.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Here is how the model is applied: (GCSYMH, p. 30-33)</strong><br>
                           <em>1. Mission is the beginning and end of the model. </em><br>
Train your committed youth to become contagious and effective in sharing their faith. <br>
                           <br>
a. Equip all your committed youth for Friendship Evangelism. Use the “Contagious Christianity” training. Equip them to share their personal story/testimony and to be aware of opportunities God will provide to influence someone else’s life, whether at home, school, work, neighborhood, or clubs. Construct your AY/Youth meetings (No. 2) in such a way that they feel free to invite their friends and non-believers they are influencing toward Jesus to come. Let them see their youth meeting as part of the cycle of evangelism. Let it be a place/event that can be of assistance to them in their mission adventures.<br>
                           <br>
b. Resources: “Becoming a Contagious Christian” training and other training tools are available at youth.adventist.org.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>2. The Meeting Model: </em><br>
Plan for your weekly meeting to be your Front Door for Evangelism Consider your regular AY meeting, youth group, or small group meeting as an event that will have multiple targets:<br>
a. Minister to non-Adventist youth<br>
b. Minister to Adventist youth who are nominal<br>
c. Minister to Adventist youth who have made a commitment to Jesus While your Message and Method are clearly defined and our three Foundations are firmly in place, these targets will define and determine the nature of your programming.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong>Elements of the meetings:</strong><br>
a. Relevant themes; develop a sense of belonging; make it attractive; engage the participants; use a variety of methods throughout the year.<br>
                           <br>
b. We live in the age of technology and wherever possible use technology in the context of your meetings.<br>
                           <br>
c. However, always remember the foundations of your ministry and always be purposeful in your pro gramming.<br>
                           <br>
d. Core elements that are generally present in whatever type of meeting you choose to run:<br>
                           <br>
1. Creative and not repetitive<br>
2. Relationally based and warm<br>
3. Grounded in practical Bible teaching relevant to the theme of the day<br>
4. Based on involvement and interaction<br>
5. Anointed in prayer<br>
                           <br>
Meetings are generally constructed around a THEME and contain a number of elements that include welcome, prayer, songs, ice breakers, quiz, interaction, role, etc.; however, there is a main segment that can be presented in a number of different ways, such as:<br>
a. Formal presentation by someone who has some insights on the theme<br>
b. Debate on the theme<br>
c. Theme presented to be discussed in a small group followed by reporting and summing up<br>
d. A musical meeting based on a theme (different songs to be presented and discussed)<br>
e. A theme to be role-played by different groups followed by discussions<br>
f. A presentation of a drama<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>Please Note</em><br>
Provide periodical alternatives to your youth meetings; they do not always have to be conducted on the church premises. Here are some possibilities:<br>
a. Meeting in nature - in a park or simply go for a purposeful nature walk;<br>
b. Visitation of a hospital/nursing home / prison / orphanage / shutins / friends who do not attend<br>
                           <br>
It would be wise to dedicate a series of meetings at specific times of the year that could take the form of a reaping campaign, when you can challenge participants to cross the line for Jesus.<br>
                           <br>
Resources: For ideas for youth meetings and Voice of Youth/ reaping campaigns, go to youth.adventist.org. Look for “Face Time” and “The One,” among others.<br>
                           <br>
3. Developing community: an essential foundation of your youth ministry Consider small group ministry to be an indispensable part of your ministry weekly or once every two weeks. This is a place of belonging for every participant, where they are known personally, cared for, accepted, and challenged to grow spiritually. This is the place where you will lead your ‘seeker’ friends for further investigation of the faith. <br>

Our vision is to transition our youth from simple membership to authentic discipleship. Youth and small group leaders are encouraged to embrace spiritual practices that develop their character and help them grow into the likeness of Jesus, the Master Teacher. They should challenge all participants to grow, whether it is in the context of the small group or individually.<br>

7. Repeat: Youth Ministry begins and ends with Service and Mission<br>
Youth ministry has developed a reputation of service as something we do overseas or at home a few times a year; however, it is God’s plan for us to develop service as a way of life. It is on the journey of service that young people come to find their unique place in ministry; this is what brings meaning and purpose in their spiritual journey. <br>
                           <br>
We consider the following elements as essential as part of our Service/Mission tool kit:<br>
a. My Story: the readiness and ability to share your personal testimony / story<br>
b. His Story: the ability to simply explain the essence of the gospel<br>
c. Our Story: a clear understanding and the ability to articulate the unique contribution of the Adventist Message<br>
d. Regular involvement in acts of compassion, justice and mercy<br>
e. Proclamation of the Word through regular evangelistic series.<br>

GC /AYM Quinquennium Theme – “Pass it On”<br>
Refer to Pass It On Booklet (GC, 2016)<br>
In keeping with the General Conference Youth Ministry Quinquennium Theme of “Pass it On,” the youth leader additionally needs to purposefully incorporate the three key elements of this initiative (Reach Up, Reach In, Reach Across) into their weekly programs, so that all three components are experienced at least once per quarter. This need not be seen as something to add; it is clearly present in all the dynamic elements of life and growth that we have seen already.<br>
                           <br>
1. Reach Up (“For the love of Christ compels us.” 2 Cor. 5:14) Spiritual Renewal through:<br>
• Worship<br>
• Prayer<br>
• Meditation (Ps. 1:2)<br>
• Spirit of Prophecy<br>
• Bible study (1 Tim. 3:16)<br>
• Other Bible Practices<br>
                           <br>
2. Reach In (“By this everyone shall know that you are my disciples if we love one another” Jn. 13:35). Church Community through:<br>
• Small Groups<br>
• Adventurers<br>
• Pathfinders<br>
• Ambassadors<br>
• Teen Ministries<br>
• Supportive Groups<br>
• Public Campus Ministries<br>
• Young Adults<br>
• (Involving Relational/Incarnational/Intergenerational)<br>
                           <br>
3. Reach Out (The Gospel to all the World in my Generation… tell the World). Mission Service through:<br>
• Public Evangelism<br>
• Small Groups<br>
• Personal Evangelism (My Story/His Story/Our Story)<br>
• Reclaim<br>
• Adventist Volunteer Services<br>
• Service Projects<br>
• Church Planting<br>
• Web Evangelism<br>
                           <br>
4. Jesus (The Center of Love and Forgiveness… Jn. 20:21 &amp; Lk. 6:12-17). It all begins with Jesus as the center (hub) of AYM for total empowerment.<br>
• Jesus is our Center of Empowerment: “As the father has sent me, I am sending you … Receive the Holy Spirit.” (Jn. 17:20-22)<br>
• His Purpose – “To Proclaim the Good News of the Kingdom of God.” Lk. 4:43 (NIV)<br>
• His Message – “The Kingdom of God has come near.” (Mk. 1:14-15)<br>
• His Method – “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.” (Acts 1:8)<br>
• His Prayer – “That all of them may be one.” (Jn. 17:20-21)<br>
The AYM model below outlines the concepts of the local youth ministries’ 5-year emphasis where Jesus is central to accomplishing the “Reach Up, Reach In, Reach Out” key emphases in a comprehensive AYM program model during the years 2016 – 2020.<br>
                           <br>
See the three principles clearly in His own earthly life:<br>
Luke 6: 12-19 (NIV)<br>
                           <br>
a. Reach Up – vs. 12 “One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray and SPENT THE NIGHT PRAYING TO GOD.”<br>
                           <br>
b. Reach In – vs. 13 When morning came, he called HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND CHOSE TWELVE of them, whom he also designated apostles: 14 Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 15 Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, 16 Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.<br>
                           <br>
c. Reach Out – vs. 17 HE WENT DOWN WITH THEM and stood on a level place.<br>
A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, 18 who had come TO HEAR HIM AND TO BE HEALED OF THEIR DISEASES. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, 19 and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.<br>
                           <br>
Resources<br>
The General Conference Youth Ministries Department has many resources and links to others that can help. Resource materials must be collected and studied in order to keep abreast of the latest developments and research discoveries in youth ministry. This can seem overwhelming, but if you dedicate an hour or two a week to your own personal “in-service training,” you can keep up. The leader should keep in contact with the conference/mission youth director, who can help the youth and young adult leader in his or her development. This contact also will help the leader to keep informed on the latest denominational programs and plans (GCSYMH, p.41).<br>

Local church programming will vary from one AY Society to another, as the youth leader assesses the needs of their youth and group size. The leader however needs to stay faithful to the key objectives of the AYM while seeking ways within the weekly programs to integrate them into the hearts and lives of their youth.<br>
                           <br>
The youth leader needs to always remember that the youth department is an integral part of the local church, incorporating the assistance of the parents, church board, and members to assist in discipline their youth for Jesus, and instilling in them a sense of outreach in mission-oriented events yearly (e. g. Global Youth Day). Building a sense of community within the group, providing opportunities for both social and spiritual development with vibrant purpose-filled programs that meet the key objectives of the youth department, must become the goal of every youth leader.<br>
                           <br>
It’s not easy to accept the role of a youth leader, but remember the Word of God to Joshua:<br>
“Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go. Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” <br>

Youth Ministry is always changing. It changes with the times; therefore, it is imperative for the Youth Leader to come up with relevant programming. This will naturally prompt the leader to think outside the box so that youth ministry is both attractive and interesting. <br>
                           <br>
The Youth Leader is expected to have a comprehensive program that is aligned with the annual themes of the General Conference Youth Ministries. A well-balanced program should include physical, social, spiritual, intellectual, and emotional components. Since the local church is the rightful hub of youth ministry, the plans of the youth council should consider the initiatives of the Division, Union, and Conference.<br>
                           <br>
The programs that take place weekly remains the key structure of the AY society. Much happens here that will attract the youth to attend the other meetings of the department. That why it is needful for the AY Leader to treat this work as the heart of evangelizing, discipline, and mobilizing the youth of their local church. <br>
                           <br>
Yet the chore of planning has caused many youth leaders frustration, some to the point of quitting, because of failure to plan relevant, interesting programs for their youth group each week. Many leaders are at a loss to know how to plan creative programs, around the mission of the local church, that will attract their youth to attend and keep them involved week after week.<br>

This module of study will assist the local AY leader in the art of relevant, creative programming, incorporating a comprehensive structure that is aligned with the annual themes of the General Conference Youth Ministries. You will learn to create a well-balanced program that incorporates the physical, social, intellectual, and emotional components that assist the youth in building their faith in Jesus. <br>
                           <br>
Because our times are changing, Adventist youth ministry needs to constantly adapt its approach in programs to the youth without neglecting the key objectives of the Youth Department as outlined by M. E. Kern, the first world youth director, with the blessings of Ellen G. White (see Module 3 for more detail).<br>

Since the local church is the rightful hub of youth ministry, the plans of the youth council should consider the yearly initiatives of the Division, Union, and Conference, each year. As a local church AY leader, you are to ensure that your programs meet the yearly themes of the GC youth department within that given year. Ellen White stresses the need for church leaders to find the best and most interesting ways to disciple the youth for Jesus Christ: <br>
                           <br>
“When the youth give their hearts to God, our responsibility for them does not cease. They must be interested in the Lord’s work and led to see that He expects them to do something to advance His cause. It is not enough to show how much needs to be done, and to urge the youth to act a part. They must be taught how to labor for the Master. They must be trained, disciplined, drilled, in the best methods of winning souls to Christ. Teach them to try in a quiet, unpretending way to help their young companions. Let different branches of missionary effort be systematically laid out, in which they may take part, and let them be given instruction and help. Thus, they will learn to work for God” (Gospel Workers, p. 210).<br>
                           <br>
Creative AY planning begins with knowing the basic programming structure around which creative programs are run as well as the needs of your youth group. This is vital to achieve well-balanced programs that includes the physical, social, spiritual, intellectual, and emotional components. Knowledge of a basic program structure will give you a steady foundation on which to carry out creative programming.<br>

                        <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                        <div class="blogdate">Sunday, December 03, 2023<br></div>
                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The many AYM manuals currently available present numerous models for developing creative youth programs. The following Servant Leader Model serves to meet the above key elements that form a successful AYM basic structure. The unique feature of this model is that it incorporates the need of involving the youth themselves in running the programs, thus creating a buy-in of acceptance from the youth in the implementation of each program and training them for further church leadership.<br>
                           <br>
Below, you will be learning a simple, six-step approach to planning your youth meetings for a whole year. But if you want your youth to learn to be leaders themselves, as we have said over and over throughout this seminar, you need to involve them from the beginning. They would love to help you plan, and their energy and enthusiasm will keep you from being overburdened and burned out. Each box in the six steps below represents a type of program to be conducted by the youth that week. Three to four youth are requested ahead of time to plan and conduct the program, with the assistance of the youth leader to guide them in resources and ensuring the presentation will fulfill the objective to be taught.<br>
                           <br>
The success of conducting the programs using the youth will engage them, and motivate them to come up with creative ways to conduct the program. Remember that a youth ministry program should be done for the youth, by the youth. Our youth have many exciting ways to run programs and this alone will create a buy-in from them because they are involved in owning the program.<br>
                           <br>
The youth leader at the beginning of the year will gain much success by using the Servant Leadership Style model to train their youth to effectively reach a stage where they are competent enough to stand alone and conduct the program with the leader as a supervisor. The youth leader and their youth need to consult together to find the best style of conducting any given program that will incorporate variety, interest, and a strong biblical foundation.<br>
                           <br>
Each week a different box/theme should be conducted using different persons so that throughout the year, all the youth of your group would have had the experience of conducting a program.<br>
                           <br>
                           <br>
6. A Six-Step Ay Programming Aid (use together with your youth)<br>
Here are six easy steps to plan an exciting, creative AY yearly program involving your youth.<br>

2. Meet with your AY Society Council and selected youth, to plan the yearly calendar.<br>
3. Fill in the major Division/Union/Conference events for the year. For example:<br>
- AY Week of Prayer<br>
- AY Celebration Day<br>
- Youth Congress/Camp<br>
- Youth Federation Programs<br>
- Bible Bowl Dates<br>
- Health and Temperance Events<br>
- AY Evangelistic Effort<br>

                           <br>
                           <em>Note: Remember to include the AYM Yearly Theme into each program</em><br>
                           <br>
4. Then proceed to fill in your Local Church Calendar Events. (Remember to invite those dept. heads of your local church to make a presentation to the youth.)<br>
                           <br>
5. Fill the dates, venue, and type of Social/Recreation events in the AY Quarterly calendar.<br>
                           <br>

The ultimate goal is “that we may present everyone perfect (mature, complete, whole) in Christ” (Col.1:8) and “to prepare God’s people for works of service (ministry), so that the body of Christ may be built up” (Eph. 4:12). Once you have filled in all the types of meetings you intend to use in a given quarter, you can brainstorm creative ways to fulfill these objectives, in ways that will interest and please your particular youth. <br>
                           <br>
1. Be sure to plan your quarterly AY Program around the Six Fundamental AY Objectives of the AY department.<br>
                           <br>
2. You may choose three to four Fundamental Objectives of the AYM each quarter to fulfill. Remember to include the AYM Yearly Theme into each program.<br>
                           <br>
3. Seek to plan in detail at least a quarter at a time, filling in all Sabbaths for that quarter. Let your young people help you brainstorm creative and exciting ways to fill in these programs.<br>
                           <br>
4. Then post your three-month program on the church notice board.<br>
                           <br>
5. Be aware, of course, that life can intervene. It may be that some things will change from the original plan, but if this happens, it is a lot less upsetting than if you had no plan at all. If you know where you want to go, you can roll with the waves that occur on your way there.<br>
                           <br>
6. Remember to seek approval from the church board, especially for new efforts or things which will cost money, at the beginning of each quarter.<br>
                           <br>
7. Try at least one thing per quarter that you’ve never tried before, and be sure to evaluate together afterward! Make a note of which things worked well, and which did not. Determine if you could do something differently and try again, or if this particular method isn’t a good fit for your group. Either is okay.<br>

The senior youth leader has much work to do, and myriad opportunities to plan creative programs for and with the youth. Remember, as you plan for the whole year, consider taking into account the holiday seasons which present ideal opportunities to carry out mission and service activities that will be life-changing to your youth. If you have differing local holidays or festivals, so much the better.<br>
                           <br>
In your planning, try to include training weekends, retreats, meal-meetings where you can continue to help those who want to assist you in ministry. After all, you will learn you cannot do it alone. Seek counsel from those that have a passion for the youth. Building a vibrant youth ministry team is the most important part of creative programming. Learn to engage your youth in all aspects programming, and you will find new energy and enthusiasm, too.<br>

The Lord has a special gift for every youth. From the bestowal of the gifts to the discovery, use, and the upkeep of the gifts, is a special journey that youth leaders are privileged to walk through by the sides of their youth. It is the responsibility of the leader to grow the church youth program by proactively reaching out to youth within the church and partnering with them to assess their spiritual gifts. They can encourage them to participate in local and conference-wide activities like Bible bowl, mission trips, global youth day and week of prayer, but the real focus is how these gifts can be expressed at the local church.<br>
                           <br>
What opportunities are available for each gift? Who are the key people in the journey? What is the role of the nuclear family and the church family? How can these gifts be used to encourage maximum involvement of the youth? <br>
                           <br>
Why should the gifts of the youth be recognized and embraced?<br>
As a disciple of Jesus Christ, every Adventist youth can be sure that he or she has full access to God through the Holy Spirit daily. It is this Spirit that guides us into all truth and brings all things to our remembrance. God the Holy Spirit also distributes gifts to the church for works of service, and to build up the body of Christ (Eph. 4: 12). Every disciple of Jesus, including the youth, has this asset available to him or her for service.<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><br>
                           </strong>Theological Foundation: Joel 2: 27 – 29; Romans 12:6-8; 1 Corinthians 12: 4 – 11; and Ephesians 4:1-13.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>The Promise</em></strong><br>
Jesus made a promise to His disciples before leaving this world, that He would send them another Comforter, whom He identified as the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is functional and operational in the daily life of everyone, whether we recognize Him or not. Once we do recognize and welcome His presence, one role of the Holy Spirit is to give gifts to God’s children. These gifts will vary according to our abilities and Christian maturity. All the gifts are given to build up God’s church and to equip each disciple for service. “Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.” (1 Corinthians 12:27, NIV)<br>
                           <br>
Scripture and the church’s expectation often seems at odds with each other. At first glance, it would seem that the congregation is deprived of gifts, while Scripture says, “We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us” (Romans 12:6). If we take God at His word, then we must believe that He not only gives us the gifts, but he gives to each of us a measure of faith as well. Yes, He has given each local church all the gifts it needs for life, health, growth, and ministry.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>The Prophecy</em></strong><br>
The prophet Joel foresaw an unprecedented manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the last days. “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit” (Joel 2: 28, 29).<br>
Amazing and exciting exhibitions of talent will take place when the young and old experience the outpouring of God’s Spirit as prophesied in this passage. Unprecedented talents, gifts, and abilities will be demonstrated in those who are so gifted by God. According to the prophet, young people will have enhanced visions and revelations of what God’s purpose is for their lives. This will be affirmed and endorsed through the wisdom given to older Christians in dreams.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>The Fulfillment</em></strong><br>
This prophecy was cited by Peter as having a partial fulfillment at Pentecost, but like many other Bible prophecies, it has dual application and is very relevant and applicable for these last days. The apostle Paul affirmed the role of the Holy Spirit in the equipping and distributing of gifts in God’s church. In Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and Ephesians 4 he outlines a variety of gifts that are given to Christian believers by the Holy Spirit. These include gifts such as teachers, government leaders, pastors, and helpers, among others. <br>
                           <br>
Ellen White writes:<br>
“God has set in the church different gifts. These are precious in their proper place, and all may act a part in the work of preparing a people for Christ’s soon coming” (Gospel Workers, p. 481).<br>
It is very clear from scripture that God never intends for all of the spiritual gifts to reside in any one individual. Similarly, it is absolutely clear that God desires and ensures that all who have been born again by His Holy Spirit become beneficiaries of one or more spiritual gifts. All gifts, including the gifts of faith and grace, are given to humankind by the Holy Spirit of God. It is our privilege to receive them and to use them for the purposes God intended. As Christian disciples, all Adventist youth can be assured that this gift is as readily available to them as it is to every other Christian, young or old, mature or immature.<br>

Through all ages God’s children have relied on the Holy Spirit for counsel, wisdom, and direction. Daniel and his friends in Babylon understood the need for complete reliance on the Holy Spirit: “In acquiring the wisdom of the Babylonians, Daniel and his companions were far more successful than their fellow students; but their learning did not come by chance. They obtained their knowledge by the faithful use of their powers, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. They placed themselves in connection with the Source of all wisdom, making the knowledge of God the foundation of their education” (PK 486).<br>
                           <br>
This is the key for those who work with the young generation. We not only seek to teach them mere life skills, which are critical and important, but encourage the youth to rely fully and completely on the Holy Spirit as they make the best of those skills. We have the faithful examples of the past. We see the difference it made for David, when he followed the voice of the Holy Spirit while using his skill and experience to defeat an indignant Goliath. We see the very opposite in David’s predecessor, King Saul, who was blessed with amazingly awesome gifts and abilities but relied on his own power, to his demise and defeat.<br>
                           <br>
Jesus was very clear when responding to the stubbornness of the Jews, “It is the Spirit which quickens: the flesh profits nothing, the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life” (John 6:63, ERV). <br>
Ruth was “only a girl.” That’s what her society would have said, and many of our contemporary societies say the same. Her Jewish neighbors could have added, “only a pagan girl.” But Naomi took her on as a young apprentice in the wise ways of being a godly wife. As a result, Ruth stayed with Naomi even after there was no relational call to do so. Back in Naomi’s hometown of Bethlehem, Ruth’s spiritual gifts of helpfulness, faith, and generosity glowed in contrast with those around her, and in the end, she became a wife again, a mother this time, and—little though she knew it—ancestor of Jesus!<br>
                           <br>
Esther was well-taught and obedient but destined for a future that probably shocked her. Instead of being wife and mother to a godly Jew, as she must have expected and perhaps longed to be, she was taken from her home into the harem of an ungodly pagan king and made queen. Obedient to Mordecai, the father figure in her life, she did not reveal her Jewishness—which must have meant foregoing ceremonies and celebrations that would have let the secret out. Did she secretly manage to keep Sabbath holy? We have many questions which will never be answered until we can ask her in person. However, we can imagine that she must have spent many a night in prayer, wondering what God’s plan for her was. Yet in the end, her clear gifts of wisdom and discernment, gained through prayer and fasting, saved her whole nation.<br>
                           <br>
Solomon was very young when the mighty responsibility for the guidance of God’s nation fell on him. Overwhelmed by this prospect, Solomon no doubt fell asleep thinking, pondering, worrying...and God sent him a dream. In the dream, God asked, “What shall I give you?” Little did Solomon know this was a test which would reveal his untried character. Solomon passed the test by begging God to give him wisdom—and became a king who is famous all over the world to this very day for his wise use of the gift God gave him by His Spirit. Solomon’s life is also a cautionary tale—being spiritually gifted will not protect us if we persist in making unwise choices. This is what we strive to teach our youth in all the areas of life covered in this seminar, and more. They must be well-rounded and whole when they come to adulthood.

Faithful men and women in all ages have understood the benefits of living by the Holy Spirit. Far too many others have been too independent and too impatient. One young man was amazingly gifted and talented but had serious character flaws. While this young man was a member of the church, it happened that he ran afoul of the law and had a criminal case pending in court. The senior church leader offered to pray for God’s intervention in his case, to which the young man replied, “I’m fine, God works too slowly.” <br>
                           <br>
The rich young ruler who met Jesus was much the same. He may have been extremely gifted and talented and accomplished much but did not see the need for the guidance of the Holy Spirit in his decision making.<br>
One of the great advantages youth leaders have is to utilize the trust which the youth have in them to inspire and motivate them to develop their God-given gifts and talents. While working and interacting with young people, youth leaders have a VIP advantage in their lives and can make this a positive partnership to help to identify and encourage these gifts. Many talents remain unused and dormant simply because they were never identified or encouraged.<br>
                           <br>
An insightful and observant youth leader will engage youth in the development of these gifts. This must be a deliberate and intentional process. The following steps are not linear; they are circular. Once you have gone through steps one through five, you are back at one again to start over. Young people grow up and move out of your program, and others come in all the time. If we want our young people to be active and productive and stay in church, we must continually help them discover and develop their gifts.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>1. Step One: Conduct a Spiritual Gifts Inventory</em></strong><br>
You will find the link for the Adventist Youth Ministries Spiritual Gifts Inventory at the end of this module, but it would be helpful to be familiar with the general categories of gifts as given in the Bible. It should also be understood that the lists in Romans, 1 Corinthians, and Ephesians are not exhaustive. God, as anyone who is even a little familiar with the Bible knows, gives whatever gifts He wants to whomever He wants to give them to, whenever He chooses to give them! It is enough to ask, will this gift or ability build the church up in love, to know that it is from God. That said, here are the main categories in the Bible. It can help to envision them as a diagram of the Body of Christ. (You will notice that some gifts are in more than one category.)<br>
                           <br>
• “Head” gifts: wisdom, discernment, knowledge, teaching, administration, and leadership, intercession<br>
• “Mouth” gifts: preaching, teaching, exhortation, prophecy*, evangelism<br>
• “Heart” gifts: faith, giving or generosity, hospitality, pastoring (chaplaincy, etc. also fit in here), mercy, intercession<br>
• “Hands” gifts: helps, mercy, hospitality—people who like to make things should read Ex. 28:3; 31:1-6: God also gives those “crafting” gifts as spiritual gifts, and we under-utilize them in our churches.<br>
• “Feet” gifts: apostleship (planting new churches), missionary, helps<br>
*Prophecy: We tend to think of this as a rare gift, one who sees the future in dreams and visions, and so on. God does sometimes work this way, as He did in Ellen White’s life (starting when she was only 17, by the way), and according to Joel, He will again. But the gift of prophecy is actually defined as someone who “speaks for God.” In a sense, preachers, teachers, and evangelists have this gift in some measure, but many, many of us, even while young, have received impressions of something God wants us to share with someone, and that is the gift of prophecy at work.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>2. Step Two: Identify the gifts and abilities of the youth</em></strong><br>
You and your young people will enjoy the exploration and study of spiritual gifts. An important thing you will see happening is them encouraging and affirming each other. One will shyly think they don’t have a gift, but the inventory shows they do. A friend, or several, chime in--” Oh, yes, you do! Remember that time when you---?” Of course, you will help them to understand that one of the important steps of discerning a gift is that it is affirmed by others when it is exercised. Many, if not most gifts will be affirmations of something the young person already feels an attraction to, but some will be surprises. And remind them these can change over their lifetimes. At 80, Moses certainly didn’t expect to be suddenly given any new gifts, let alone be called to lead the people out of Egypt!<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>3. Step Three: Encourage those gifts and talents</em></strong><br>
No matter how much the youth encourage each other, it will be your task as leader to be the head cheerleader. You don’t want to give the impression that the young person gets any credit for whatever gift God has bestowed, as if they are somehow special above the others and “deserve” this gift somehow. But you certainly do want to affirm and encourage. If a young person feels she cannot do the thing God seems to be calling her to do, you can say that God wouldn’t ask it if He didn’t believe in what this young person can do with His help, and that God never calls us to do anything on our own. If another seems to be feeling proud or acting conceited about his gift(s), remind the group that no gift is greater than another, and nobody simply sprouted his own gift; they all came directly from God and should be used humbly and for His purpose.<br>
True Maria. God doesn’t take back the gift. But I don’t see where that fits here. In fact, be sure to round out your spiritual gifts Bible study with 1 Cor. 13, which shows the “more excellent way” of the greatest gift of all. It’s not any of those listed above—it’s Love. True love, the kind that only comes from God, and with it enthroned in our hearts we can’t be either too humble or too proud.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>4. Step Four: Engage or utilize these gifts and talents in ministry</em></strong><br>
Here is where “the rubber meets the road.” Spiritual gifts are given for very specific purposes, and we don’t need to guess or figure out what those purposes are. They are listed very plainly in the same scriptures that list the gifts. They are for strengthening disciples, building up the body of Christ, His church, and reaching out to share His love outside our walls.<br>
                           <br>
So, once you have a list of the gifts within your group, you are ready to put your young people to work, and they will be much more inclined to help, because they will be doing things they are good at, which God is calling their hearts to do. This is when you create the plans we have talked about at other points in this seminar and mobilize your energetic young “army” for Jesus. Great things will happen, and then you will come together, evaluate, take note of changes you want to make next time, and yes, comfort each other for mistakes made and encourage each other to try again, with your hands in God’s.<br>
                           <br>
                           <strong><em>5. Step Five: Affirm those gifts constantly</em></strong><br>
As a youth leader, you know, yourself, how easy it is to get discouraged, or simply drift away and forget your calling in the midst of life and its stresses. For young people, this is even more true. Their friends are making fun of their attempts to use their gift for evangelism. Or their parents don’t understand their desire to be hospitable or generous. The “old people” (that’s us!) in the church don’t like the way they do ministry. Or the youth are “just too busy” with school and work and fun. Constant, mutual encouragement will go a long way toward helping all of you move ahead on the journey God is leading you on, to become fully committed disciples of Jesus. <br>

It cannot be overemphasized how important it is for youth leaders to help young people discover their spiritual gifts, and then to provide or create opportunities for them to use them for God. Every local congregation has youth who are extremely gifted. It takes a spirit filled and attentive youth leader to identify and encourage the gifts in our youth. All Christians have full and complete access to the Holy Spirit at all times and are beneficiaries of the gifts which He bestows. It is the privilege of every youth to be a recipient of one or more of these gifts. A proper understanding of the role of spiritual gifts in ministry is a necessity for every youth leader. Youth leaders have a unique privilege and opportunity to encourage young people to identify and develop their spiritual gifts. This task will be made much easier if the youth leader is equipped with the tools to identify their own gifts and to ask God daily to assist them in developing and utilizing them in ministry.<br>

                           <em>The Church Exists for Mission</em><br>
When the apostle Peter, still in the first century of Christianity, sought to explain the reason for the existence of the church, he quoted what God had said to His people before Sinai: Peter reminded us that we, the church of God, is a “holy nation, a royal priesthood, a people chosen by God for the purpose of proclaiming the virtues of Him who brought us out of darkness into His marvelous light.” <br>
                           <br>
We exist for a purpose; we have a mission: to proclaim the virtues of Christ. Christ himself left this mission: to preach the Gospel to every tribe, language, and people. This same mission is identified in the context of the three angels’ messages when we see that each angel brings with him a Gospel to announce to everyone on earth. If the church exists for the purpose of evangelizing the world, then our young people’s programs should reflect this. We as leaders should be about the business of both evangelizing our youth, and recruiting them to take their place in the world church as young evangelists.<br>
                           <br>
But what does “evangelist” mean? Is it only an official, paid position, someone who goes out and preaches to crowds at large meetings? Or is it true that, one way or another, every Christian is to be an evangelist?<br>
If the word Gospel means “Good News,” then the evangelist must be happy about what he or she is sharing. To simply speak of the problems of society is not to evangelize. This is journalism. The act of evangelizing is something that, regardless of form or method, must take place in a context of “good news,” “happy novelty,” both to the speaker and to the listener. Evangelism does not deny the sad reality, but it brings back to this sad reality the joy that hope produces in the hearts of those who believe in the “good news” of the Gospel.<br>

This module will consider different forms of evangelism and how to motivate our youth to experiment with them to discover what their particular best place in mission is. We will also examine biblical models, and realize the importance of spiritual gift discernment in determining what an individual’s role should be in the mission of the church. <br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
When the writer of Hebrews begins his epistle by talking about the “various ways” through which God has always sought to speak to human beings, he not only describes a form of God’s action, but grounds a reality: in the transmission of the Gospel message, there are diverse ways and means of transmitting the same message. Let’s look at a few of them. <br>
                           <br>
                           <em>Relational or Friendship Evangelism</em><br>
This is the method that is most often used and with which most people will be more comfortable. It is, in a very real sense, what Jesus did when He “mingled with the people, seeking their good.” Your youth already have friends. (Those who don’t are in need of a different kind of help, and helping them learn to be friendly and find friends will be a first step in evangelism, both to them and to the friends.) Help them learn to see that when they act in loving ways toward their friends they are doing the work of God. This does not mean preaching to their friends or trying to convince them to believe what we believe. As a matter of fact, trying to argue someone into something does far more harm than good.<br>
                           <br>
It does mean being there for their friends—having a trustworthy listening ear, watching for ways to help and encourage them, and also receiving help from them. The best kind of friendship is the one in which both friends are seeking to help the other be his or her best self. Then, when the relationship is strong and has grown in intimacy, at some point the friend will have questions about what you believe. Why, for instance, are you able to remain in a state of trust when things are going wrong? That is the time we need to be ready with answers for why we believe what we believe, what Jesus has done and is doing for us, and stories of grace we’ve seen in our own lives. That’s when it’s accepted as the best of Good News.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>Small Groups</em><br>
On a little more formal basis, all youth organizations should also have small groups which get together to sing, study the Bible, pray, and share stories. We have many excellent resources for how to begin and carry on small group ministries. If you already have small groups in place, it might just be the best place for someone to easily bring a friend who is beginning to have questions about faith and spiritual practice. <br>
Hopefully, these friends would have already been invited to fun events, outings, or service opportunities the youth group is doing, and which many will enjoy even if they are not yet spiritually awakened.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>Local Community Service Projects</em><br>
The priority area for the ministry of youth is the community. One of the main needs of young people, one of the main reasons they become bored and restless, is the need to be needed. The community is a real space, with real people, and real needs. Any action in favor of the community is an action that will produce reactions, transformations that can be perceived. This encourages all involved, but especially the young.<br>
Although it seems romantic (even epic), the idea of serving in distant lands beyond the sea, as vital as this dimension of service is, is far from being the only possible way of doing mission. For the great majority of people, the call to mission takes place in the context of “flourish where you are planted”. There is no denying this local, daily dimension of evangelism. The ends of the world need the Gospel. But Jesus told His disciples to start first at home, in Jerusalem and Samaria, then all Judea.<br>
                           <br>
Youth must be taught by example that every church has a special responsibility to its community. Although our system oversees the financial maintenance of mission in distant lands (see our Sabbath school offering system), the church cannot ignore that it has a special responsibility to the community in which it is situated. The Jerusalem of every young person is the place where he lives, the school where she studies, it is his university, her work environment.<br>
                           <br>
In the ideals of Youth Ministry, we can clearly perceive this broad and inclusive vision of the Mission, for, driven by the “Love of Christ” that motivates me, the target challenges me to preach the Advent Message to the whole world in my generation. “Everyone” includes those who are close to me. By committing myself, in the Vow, to take part in the Youth Ministry of the local church, I am showing interest in my local reality. In the purpose, I am reminded that I exist for the youth, the church and my fellow human. In the Objectives I understand that I exist to Save from Sin and Guide in Service. In the Mission statement, I am urged to “work for the young, fostering fellowship and spiritual motivation, empowering them to serve the church and the community.”<br>
                           <br>
Not only that but doing local community service of some kind is one of the most effective forms of evangelism. It raises awareness of the church as a whole, and of the youth in particular; it’s something you can invite youth to help with, and it opens doors no other kind of service. If someone is worrying about basic human needs, from where their next meal will come from to how they will get their lawns mowed or get to their next doctor’s appointment, it’s hard for them to be very interested in going somewhere to hear a sermon.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>Public Proclamation</em><br>
Here we come to the thing that most people first think of when they hear the word “evangelism.” It is an important part of our mission to the world, and some of your young people will be interested and gifted in the ways they need to be to help with public proclamation. When your church puts on evangelistic series, your youth can be helpful in every aspect of this endeavor, from planning, inviting, putting up posters, stuffing envelopes, and sharing it on all their social media networks, to greeting at the door, sitting with guests, helping to answer questions, and yes, preaching and singing, too. For that matter, why wait until a special series to let them try all these ways of helping? You may have a budding young preacher in your midst who could learn invaluable lessons by preaching now and then.<br>
                           <br>
When members of your youth ministry has already been active in being true friends to those they know, meeting and praying in small groups and inviting others to join in, and doing visible community service that matters—not for the purpose of “getting people to come to your meetings or to church,” but simply because they are in need and it’s the right thing to do—then many more will, in fact, be interested in the public meetings.<br>

Every method, every form, every way of evangelizing should be taught in such a way that the young enjoy it. Remember: “Gospel” is something happy for those who speak as well as for those who listen. Therefore, evangelization must take place in such a context that the youth appreciate it.<br>
                           <br>
In Module One (The Youth Leader as a Spiritual Leader, Mentor, and Friend), it was mentioned that young people, especially in the context of postmodernity, are pragmatic. They believe in what works. They need to see how the things they believe affect real, day-to-day life. A method of evangelism that works in practice will always be a method that the young will appreciate. Realizing that your actions are providing a reaction in the intended direction will bring tremendous satisfaction and joy to the young person who is involved in the process of evangelism.<br>
It is especially important that each young person is being carefully led to discover and use his or her own special gifts.<br>
                           <br>
The discovery of spiritual gifts will help to connect the young to the type of evangelism they are comfortable with.<br>
We have observed that the AYM Mission Statement challenges me to empower young people to serve the church and the community. This training includes training, but it is not limited to that.<br>
Empowerment includes making young people fit to fulfill the mission of proclaiming the gospel. If we already understand that this proclamation must take place in a context of good news, something good for the proclaimer and the receiver, there is no denying the crucial importance of allowing the young person to do what they need in a way that they like. No matter what age we are, we all have seen the sad results when someone, perhaps for years, has dutifully filled a position they really don’t like and for which they are not gifted or fitted, just because they think they must. This is not evangelism, nor is it a good way to run a church!<br>
                           <br>
The most effective way for evangelism to happen is for the young person to fulfill his mission in the context of exercising his spiritual gifts. It is therefore the duty of the youth leader to guide the process of discovering the Spiritual Gifts of their youth. This discovery will help affirm the youth and young adults in the kind of evangelism they feel comfortable with. And there is no denying the reality: Happy people work better. A young person doing what she needs in the way she likes, is a young person doing what she needs to be happy. <br>
                           <br>
While she discovers true joy in service, others are discovering the joy of following God. That is evangelizing. Happy—it will be more effective. Happy—they will feel more fulfilled. Happy—they will be more creative in finding ways and means to bless their community with the reality of a transforming Gospel.<br>

Try it: Instead of you alone wanting to determine the form and manner in which your young people should evangelize, dialogue with them about possible ways and means, how they would like to see it done. Ask what they like to do. Challenge them to think of new ways to do what needs to be done. Analyze together the reality of your local community. Help them realize every community is different. What is the character of theirs? What are the values of the community? What are taboos? What are the connection values? If evangelism is “Good News”, what would be the “Good News” in the context of this individual community? The people of the community have already tried the “Bad News” of Satan. We all are victims of sin. Look for ways to transform the life of the community for the better.<br>
                           <br>
For example: A universal value of connection is love. Christ knew that. Christ’s method in all the communities He visited was to love. When He loved, He attracted. Those who felt loved and supported were also attracted. Loving is always right. Yet different actions say “Love” to different people and in different places. Together with your youth, study the differing methods of Jesus. When did He use friendship evangelism? When did He use small group evangelism? What kinds of community service did He do? When and how did He proclaim publicly? Then determine which of these methods will work best in your community. You may use them all, at some point. Have a plan. But also pray a lot, and allow the Holy Spirit to work in ways that seem to you to be completely off your plan! <br>
                           <br>
The human being is reactive. By default, it reacts to the stimuli it receives. If one is simply criticized in his worldview, he will become defensive (or go on the attack). He will close his heart (and maybe his fist). Now if he feels loved he will open his heart. Jesus left the example.<br>

“Christ Lifted the Stigma from Poverty—Christ has ever been the poor man’s friend. He chose poverty, and honored it by making it His lot. He has stripped from it forever the reproach of scorn by blessing the poor, the inheritors of God’s kingdom. Such was His work. By consecrating Himself to a life of poverty He redeemed poverty from its humiliation. He took His position with the poor that He might lift from poverty the stigma that the world had attached to it. He knew the danger of the love of riches. He knew that this love is ruinous to many souls. It places those who are rich where they indulge every wish for grandeur. It teaches them to look down on those who are suffering the pressure of poverty. It develops the weakness of human minds and shows that notwithstanding the abundance of wealth, the rich are not rich toward God.” (Welfare Ministry, 172.3)<br>
                           <br>
“Our Savior went from house to house, healing the sick, comforting the mourners, soothing the afflicted, speaking peace to the disconsolate. He took the little children in His arms and blessed them, and spoke words of hope and comfort to the weary mothers. With unfailing tenderness and gentleness, He met every form of human woe and affliction. Not for Himself, but for others did He labor. He was the servant of all. It was His meat and drink to bring hope and strength to all with whom He came in contact” (Gospel Workers, 188).<br>
                           <br>
“Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Savior mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, “Follow Me” (The Ministry of Healing, 143).<br>

It is the youth who will finish the work. The youth leader who is able to instill these mission principles into the hearts of young will not only be fulfilling a leadership role but will be helping the youth fulfill the purpose for which Adventist Youth Ministry exists. The young have a mission, and this mission is a prophetic duty. They will finish the job. Joel prophesied that young people would be directly involved in proclaiming the message: “[In the last days] I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions” (Joel 2:28).<br>
                           <br>
The target “The Advent message to the whole world in my Generation” establishes the sense of urgency that must be imprinted. The mission of preaching the gospel must now be completed in their generation.<br>

It is the leader’s responsibility and privilege to cultivate that passion and commitment, while encouraging increasing levels of participation of each young person in the fulfillment of the mission in a holistic way. This integrity in the fulfillment of the mission will give qualitative aspects (forms, methods, and manners) and at the various levels of involvement (personal, small groups, public proclamation, local community service projects).<br>
                           <br>
By challenging young to engage in these various levels, the youth leader will be giving the young the blessing of having day-to-day, mission-driven involvement. Youth will learn how to testify of their faith at the level of personal relationships, whether by studying the Bible with someone through a series of Bible Studies or through every day or occasional dialogues where they will always have the opportunity to impart spiritual values and experiences.<br>
                           <br>
They can participate in Small Groups and Youth Sabbath School Classes where they can experience a maturing of their faith as well as help other young people to grow. They will have the opportunity to engage in public proclamation, both on a normal Sabbath and in public evangelism series. They will participate in local community service projects where they will have the opportunity to involve non-Adventist friends—or help them in projects they already have going on.<br>
                           <br>
Remember, this is one of the most effective methods of personal evangelism today: Involve those who intend to evangelize in joint actions to meet the needs of a community. Giving people a sense of belonging is the most effective way to make them believe. For many years, people first had to show that they believed before they were allowed to belong. But that’s not the way Jesus did it. The world changed. Involvement in common experiences is the most effective way to convey values and make them common. It is the “Test Drive” of the Gospel. First try it, then want it for yourself. It works.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>Be open to change</em><br>
Although these various levels of involvement can be achieved through various structures present in the context of the church and the Youth Ministry, they do not need to (and should not) be restricted to pre-existing structures. For an ever-changing society, methods, forms, and ways must continue to change. Your youth will be your best source of new ideas and creative methods.<br>
                           <br>
Love (by God and people) is the driving principle that will ground all actions. But the methods, forms and ways need to be relevant to the reality with which it is intended to dialogue. Emphasize therefore the importance of guiding young people in discovering their spiritual gifts, and in the challenge of applying these gifts, in methods of evangelism preferred by themselves (under the guidance of the leader).<br>
                           <br>
But there remains one final question: Why by themselves? Simple: Young are the best translation of the reality in which they are inserted. They are the best thermometer of this reality, and can become an effective thermostat of the reality of a postmodern, relativistic, pluralistic, individualistic, and pragmatic society. Ellen White said it accurately: “The Lord appointed the youth to be His helping hand” (3T, p. 104).<br>

The first language of many of youth is not French, Portuguese, Tswana, Swahili or English, it’s social media. Traditionally, friendships have been personal, but since the advent of social media, they have, to a great extent, become digital instead. We cannot ignore the power and influence of social media on our youth, but we need to educate them on both the opportunities and the dangers. The leader should help the youth to be stewards of social media.<br>

Call it cyberspace, call it the web, call it your virtual life—whatever you call it, the internet is an incredible marvel of technology. And like most marvels of technology, it has incredible potential for good, and for evil. We’ve all heard the horror stories about the web. Pornography is so readily available that even elementary-school kids can click onto X-rated sites. And what about the safety factor? Almost everyone has a story about someone who gave out their name and address to a friend they met in a chatroom and ended up being the victim of a psychotic stalker. If these are the images you have of the web, your reaction may be, why would any Christian want to get involved in that? I should just stay away from it! <br>
                           <br>
But the web is not only about computers. It’s about people, media, and choices and those are all important issues for any Christian. We can choose to use email to keep in touch with friends, do research for school or work projects, check out and support our favorite Christian music artists, and discuss hobbies, not to mention spiritual subjects with people around the whole world. The web has a great potential for good. And it’s here to stay. Here are some alarming facts to consider:<br>
                           <br>
In the USA:<br>
a. Today’s teens spend more than 7 ½ hours a day consuming media—watching TV, listening to music, surfing the Web, social networking, and playing video games.<br>
b. 93% of teens ages 12-17 go online.<br>
c. 38% of teens ages 12-17 send text messages daily, while a quarter send daily messages via social networks.<br>
d. One in every 25 teens had “problematic Internet use” and those students also tended to be more depressed and would get into serious fights more often. And boys in that category had higher rates of smoking and drug use.<br>
                           <br>
Cell phones, too, are amazing and incredible things! The average cell phone user has more computing power in their palm than what it took to land men on the moon in 1969… technology really has come a long way.<br>
                           <br>
Cell phones are a true blessing; allowing us opportunities to multi-task and work smarter, not harder, and to access information at lightning-fast speed; or contact someone quickly and efficiently in case of an emergency; or share the love of Jesus through a verse, testimony, poem, etc. Plus, we can choose from virtually any type of game, app, or entertainment we desire. Nowadays the cell phone connects its user to virtually anyone in the world at the touch of a screen.<br>
                           <br>
But as with anything that offers us blessings, there are curses in disguise and with the incredible power that cell phones give teens, great responsibility and caution must be exercised in how they are used.<br>

We must help our youth understand that technology is neither some scary, evil plot to destroy their minds and souls, nor is it the heaven-sent answer to all of earth’s problems. It’s just a tool, and it can be used for good or evil. Like everything else in life, it comes down to the choices we make. As we have studied throughout this seminar, a very important part of our leadership is to model good social media choices in our own lives. If we’re not, it won’t matter what we tell them.<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>Some Things Your Young People Need to Know</em><br>
1. Anyone can put up a website, so it’s our responsibility to make sure that the information we’re getting is coming from a reliable source. Teach youth to compare different, reliable sources before believing everything they read. <br>
                           <br>
2. Using the Web for entertainment is just as legitimate as picking up a book, turning on the TV, or putting a CD in the stereo. And we need to follow the same guidelines. Would Jesus cheerfully watch/listen to this with you?<br>
                           <br>
3. Always follow safety rules (see details below)<br>
                           <br>
                           <em>Rules for Social Media Safety</em><br>
(This is suitable for printing and handing out to your young people.)<br>
1. Never give out your real name, address or phone number. Unless you already know them personally, keep your online friendships online; don’t plan to meet in real life. Be careful about giving any identifying information like your hometown, the name of your school, the name of a team you play on etc., that might allow a stalker to identify you. You can share what’s going on in your life with online friends without having to give a lot of details.<br>
                           <br>
2. Never abuse; make fun of, or bully someone online! Not only is this behavior inappropriate in all social media environments, but it is also against the law and downright ungodly! Jesus made it clear that we should always seek to treat others the way that we would want to be treated ourselves (Matt. 7:12).<br>
                           <br>
3. Set reasonable personal time limits. The apostle Paul had this to say about doing things—even good things—too much: “You say, ‘I am allowed to do anything’ but not everything is good for you. You say, ‘I am allowed to do anything’—but not everything is beneficial” (1 Corinthians 10:23, NLT). The reality is that most youth’s online time will be spent on social media; so, limit yourself…and if you have a problem with that…<br>
                           <br>
4. Walk with the wise. Solomon in Proverbs 13:20 writes, “Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm” (NIV). If you’ve got friends who are choosing to use the internet unwisely—then it’s likely that you’ll also fall prey to the negative peer pressure. Choose your friends wisely. They will either help you or hurt you.<br>
                           <br>
5. Make yourself accountable to a caring adult. Talk to a parent, teacher, youth pastor, Pathfinder leader or counselor. Any adult who cares about you will be more than happy to help you find a balance in your life when it comes to social media.<br>

For many youth the internet and social media are great ways to access information, get entertainment, and stay connected with friends and family, but for some—a surprisingly large number—the internet can actually become an addiction. <br>
                           <br>
In China, in February 2015, a teen known only as “Little Wang,” in an effort to end his internet addiction, cut his left hand off. The 19-year-old called a taxi to take him to the hospital, leaving a note telling his mother he’d be back soon. He left the hand behind on the nearby bench where he cut it off, but the hospital was able to reattach it. Still, he may not regain full control of it, surgeons say. A teacher says the boy’s Internet habit made him “impetuous.” This is, of course an extreme case, but the fact is that the internet can be extremely addictive.<br>
                           <br>
                           <u>Warning Signs of Addiction</u><br>
•Diminished interest in activities youth once enjoyed<br>
•Feelings of distress or anxiousness when youth cannot use the Internet<br>
•Secretive Internet usage<br>
•Withdrawal from activities with family and friends<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
On the web, just as anywhere else, the Christian’s guideline should be “Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things” (Philippians 4:8, NIV). There are a lot of websites out there that simply aren’t pure, noble, true, or appropriate for a Christian person, young or old.<br>
                           <br>
Maybe it’s because the web is such a new technology, maybe because it’s so private, but whatever the reason, some people feel that the usual rules don’t apply. They’ll click onto pornographic websites even though they would never buy a Playboy magazine or rent an X-rated movie. Let’s face it, pornography is pornography, wherever you find it. And it’s never appropriate for a Christian. Neither is violence, hatred, racism or spiritualism (witchcraft, wicca, ghosts, demons, etc.). <br>
                           <br>
Yes, there are websites that advocate all those things. We must help our youth to understand that looking for such things, or staying there out of curiosity if we accidentally stumble across them while looking for something else is dangerous. They should leave the site immediately. There are also resources at the end for software which will help screen out such sites. God wants our youth to “Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart” (2 Timothy 2:22, NIV).<br>
                           <br>
They need to learn, also, that even if they are only visiting wholesome, positive sites, maybe even Christian ones; their use of the web may still be hurting their spiritual life. Web-surfing can be addictive. Some people spend hours and hours each day at it, neglecting family and friends, exercise, sleep, work, school, and time with God. Discuss with them ways to examine how much time they are spending online and whether it is getting in the way of other activities. Some may need to give themselves an internet/social media vacation until they get their priorities straightened out. Moses, in Psalm 90:12 wisely writes: “Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom” (NIV).<br>
                           <br>
Many youth fall prey to the devil’s trap when it comes to the choices they make online, but God says: “Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect” (Romans 12:2 NLT). <br>
                           <br>
The thing that may help the most is simply remembering that our minds and bodies belong to God and are a holy place where He lives (1 Cor. 6:19-20). Create some activities which help to reinforce this, and it will tend to chase away all unhealthy obsessions, online or not.<br>

“God calls us to live in light of His grace, knowing the infinite cost God paid to save us. Through the Holy Spirit we glorify God in our minds, bodies and spirits. We are called to be a godly people who think, feel and act in harmony with the principles of heaven. For the Holy Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we should involve ourselves only in those things which will produce Christ-like purity, health and joy in our lives. This means that our amusement and entertainment should meet the highest standards of Christian taste and beauty... It also means that because our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we are to care for them intelligently. Along with adequate exercise and rest, we are to . . . engage in whatever brings our thoughts and bodies into the discipline of Christ, who desires our wholesomeness, joy and goodness. (Rom. 12:1, 2; 1 John 2:6; Eph. 5:1-21; Phil. 4:8; 2 Cor. 10:5; 6:14-7:1; 1 Peter 3:1-4; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 10:31; Lev. 11:1-47; 3 John 2.)”<br>

                        <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
It is important to understand the key difference between the internet and social media. The internet is a kind of super-highway, and social media—things like Facebook, Snap Chat, Twitter, YouTube, Vine, Tumblr, Medium, Kik, and Instagram—are all different side-roads that can be used on that superhighway. <br>
                           <br>
As we have studied, we can help our youth make wise choices about which apps to use and how to use them by filtering all choices through God and His Word, the Bible. It is fine for them to use the web to stay in contact with friends and family who are miles away. Whether they send letters by email, arrange to meet in a (private) chatroom, or post family pictures on a website for grandma to view, they can use the web to strengthen the relationships they already have.<br>
                           <br>
But what’s much more intriguing and controversial is using the web to make new friendships. There are lots of ways to do this. One of the most common is through chatrooms where people meet to talk about common interests. Chatrooms range from places where Christians meet for online Bible studies, to places where people gather to discuss downright perverted topics. Young people are naturally curious, and on top of that, being “invisible” online can lead to a feeling of deceptive power and safety. They will take chances they might not in real life. They must learn to exercise choice and discretion in deciding where to chat and with whom. People also meet online through message boards and news groups, where one can post a message on a topic that interests one and check back later to see if anyone’s answered the post. Here is where the safety rules above especially apply.<br>
                           <br>
Chatrooms, message boards, and newsgroups can all begin to take on a sense of community as the same people use them over and over and get to know each other. People can either post questions and information by typing, but they can also connect via face-to-face as well with things like Google Hangouts, Skype, Facebook, and FaceTime. As is to be expected, online friendships (and romances/infatuations) do form. <br>
                           <br>
Someone can go from discussing a hobby they’re interested in, to sharing concerns and problems from their everyday lives, and even (on many Christian sites) asking for prayer and encouragement from fellow believers. This sense of community—of knowing and being known—can be great. It can also be deceptively dangerous.<br>
                           <br>
Remind your young people: Online friendships can be wonderful. But they come with a major warning attached: generally, you don’t actually see these people. You don’t know anything about them, except what they choose to reveal on their computers. Some people are probably telling you the truth about their age, gender, interests, and other characteristics, but there’s nothing to stop someone from lying. Always be cautious with people you chat with online. Remember, somebody in your chatroom may not be who they say they are. It’s sad, but true, that there are sick people out there who lurk in youth chatrooms looking for young people of whom they can take advantage of: hurt, abuse, kidnap, rape, or even murder!<br>
                           <br>
Does this mean they should never chat, post messages, or otherwise get acquainted with people online? No, it simply means they must remain watchful and follow the safety rules. One great safety is the same as it is in everyday, personal life: trusted adults. Remind your youth that in the same way that parents (or other trusted adults) would like to meet and know the friends they bring over to the house, so they should be invited to “meet” online friends. <br>
                           <br>
If you have modeled good, compassionate, caring, and open leadership qualities for them, they will be more likely to believe that you might know something more than they do about who is to be trusted online. Of course, you know that not all your young people have trustworthy parents, and some have parents they could, in fact, trust, but for whatever reason, they don’t. They need to be able to turn to you for guidance.<br>
                           <br>
More Suggestions, from psychologist, speaker and popular author, Dr. Tim Elmore:<br>
                           <br>
1. Teach your young people to balance “screen time” with “face time.” For every hour they spend in front of a screen, they should spend equal hours face to face with people. This will help them keep their soft skills high as they enter a job.<br>
                           <br>
2. Place your kids in groups and ask them two questions to prompt discussion:<br>
a. What are the advantages to new technology in our lives?<br>
b. What are the disadvantages to new technology in our lives?<br>
                           <br>
3. When spending time in face-to-face conversations, always prioritize those people. Place your phone on silent and give eye contact with the persons in front of you. This communicates they are the priority and that you can reply to messages later.<br>
                           <br>
4. Give assignments that force young people to interface with people from older or younger generations. Whenever we converse with those different from us we grow in our emotional intelligence and in our communication skills.<br>
                           <br>
5. Teach your students that whenever they feel they’re slipping into a dependence or addiction to anything—it always helps to take time off. Together, you and they can do a “technology fast” and put your phones, tablets or laptops away for a season. You’ll all feel liberated.<br>
                           <br>
6. Encourage parents to talk to their children about these issues—at least before middle school. They should monitor their kids’ cell phone and Facebook page, as long as they still live at home. Talk about it so it’s not a secret, but remind them accountability is good, and prevents harm. Let them see your pages, too, to help them see that you, too, follow good internet safety rules.<br>
                           <br>
7. Work with schools to communicate that sexting is illegal/immoral. Teen sexting leads to criminal charges; and when photos get sent to another state it’s a federal offense.”<br>
                           <br>
8. Teach Social Etiquette with Cell Phones (see “Additional Resources” for link)<br>
                           <br>
9. Teach them that choices have consequences<br>
                           <br>
10. Teach them to think before they act<br>
                           <br>
11. Teach them that what’s posted online, stays online… forever!<br>

Discuss:<br>
                           <br>
A. Because of the dangers, some parents are hesitant to grant internet privileges to their teens. Others allow their teens total freedom to surf the net as they please. How much freedom or restraint do you think teens should be allowed on the internet? List at least four internet safety rules.<br>
                           <br>
B. Read 1 Corinthians 9:19-23 and discuss: what are some ways a Christian youth could use the internet and social media to help spread the gospel?<br>
                           <br>
C. How can social media be incorporated in Youth Ministry?<br>

Youth today use technology as a natural part of their life. They have been born into and grown up in a world that is infused with it. Cell phones, the internet and social media can either be an incredible help or hindrance to them. It’s all in how you, as their youth leader, have prepared yourself to train them and their parents about both the positive and negative aspects of it.<br>
