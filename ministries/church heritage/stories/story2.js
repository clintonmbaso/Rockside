            <h2>The Church of the Old Testament</h2>

<p>God’s church stretches from Eden to Eden. Those who have obeyed God have been called by various names, such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>the sons of God</em></li>
    <li><em>the seed of Abraham</em></li>
    <li><em>the children of Israel</em></li>
    <li><em>Christians</em></li>
</ul>

<p>They all have the same fundamental beliefs.</p>

<h3>The Law of God in the Old Testament</h3>

<p>The church of the Old Testament accepted the law of God as its rule of life. The <strong>Ten Commandment law</strong> is unchangeable because it is an expression of God’s character, which is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Universal</li>
    <li>Eternal</li>
    <li>Unchangeable</li>
</ul>

<p>Long before the commandments were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, the people of God were already keeping them. God said:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” — <em>Genesis 26:5</em>
</blockquote>

<h3>God’s Method of Salvation</h3>

<p>God has had only one method of salvation, one standard of righteousness, all through the ages. We read in Psalm 105:8-11 that He made a covenant with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Abraham</li>
    <li>Isaac</li>
    <li>Jacob</li>
    <li>The children of Israel</li>
</ul>

<p>as <strong>“an everlasting covenant.”</strong> God declares that the covenant was made forever:</p>

<blockquote>
    “The word which He commanded to a thousand generations.” — <em>Psalm 105:8-11</em>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not correct to say that in the Old Testament times, people were under law, and in New Testament times, people are under grace. God has always maintained a <strong>harmony of law and grace</strong>. We are saved by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and once we have experienced salvation and entered a relationship with Him, we delight in doing His will.</p>

<h3>Faith and Sacrifice in the Old Testament</h3>

<p>The members of the Old Testament church showed their faith in the plan of salvation by offering a sacrifice. By faith, they accepted God’s plan, for the sacrifice was a symbol of the <strong>Lamb of God</strong>, who would take away the sins of the world. Through faith in the coming Messiah, they became:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Free men and women</li>
    <li>New creatures in Christ</li>
</ul>

<p>The hope of the ages has always been the coming of the Lord.</p>

<h3>Guidance Through Prophets</h3>

<p>God instructed the church members in Old Testament times through prophets. Moses was the first writer whom God used to record permanent instructions for His church and to preserve the people’s experiences for future generations. These inspired writings were read to the congregations on the:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Seventh-day Sabbath</li>
    <li>Other special occasions</li>
</ul>

<p>These writings are known to us as the <strong>Old Testament</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Church of the New Testament</h2>

<p>The church of the New Testament received its fundamental beliefs from the Old Testament church. It accepted the law of God as a rule of life. The Lord Jesus knew that some people would think He came to replace the teachings of the Old Testament church and the law, so He said:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” — <em>Matthew 5:17</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Like the Old Testament church, the New Testament church loved and cherished the law of God. Paul declared:</p>

<blockquote>
    “I delight in the law of God after the inward man.” — <em>Romans 7:22</em>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Coming of Jesus and the Apostolic Church</h3>

<p>The Church of the New Testament was privileged to have the Lord of glory come to them in human form. Unfortunately, despite studying the Scriptures, many church members were so bound by tradition that they missed accepting Jesus as the Savior of the world. The apostles continued to preach:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” — <em>Acts 4:12</em>
</blockquote>

<h3>Organization and Evangelism</h3>

<p>After the ascension of Christ, the apostolic church was organized, with James becoming the first general president. The church had a strong evangelistic program. In addition to the twelve apostles, key figures included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Paul — perhaps the greatest evangelist of all time</li>
    <li>Barnabas</li>
    <li>Silas</li>
    <li>John Mark</li>
    <li>Apollos</li>
    <li>Timothy</li>
    <li>Titus</li>
</ul>

<p>Deacons were also elected as officers of the early church.</p>

<h3>The Mission of the Early Church</h3>

<p>It appears that the headquarters of the early church was at Jerusalem, but the apostles and teachers were commissioned to:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” — <em>Mark 16:15</em>
</blockquote>

<p>The officers and members of the early Christian church wrote Gospels and Epistles not only for the early church but also for future generations of Christians.</p>

<h3>Persecution and Challenges</h3>

<p>Only a few weeks after Jesus ascended to heaven, the New Testament church faced persecution. The disciples were imprisoned for preaching, and Stephen became the first martyr. As Christianity spread through the Roman Empire, believers faced severe persecution, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Imprisonment</li>
    <li>Torture</li>
    <li>Execution</li>
</ul>

<p>The darkest hours of persecution occurred between <strong>A.D. 100 to 300</strong>. When the sword could not destroy the Christian church, the enemy of souls used another tactic — making the church popular with the state and introducing pagan rites and ceremonies into Christian worship.</p>

<h3>Compromise and Apostasy</h3>

<p>Gradually, false teachings infiltrated the church. The simple faith was lost as Christians gained wealth and power in business and government. In <strong>A.D. 476</strong>, the barbarian tribes overthrew the Roman Empire, and the head of the church at Rome became known as the bishop.</p>

<p>At this time, the Bible was not placed in the hands of church members for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Handwritten copies were scarce.</li>
    <li>Church leaders feared that people would discover certain doctrines — such as the immortality of the soul, worship of saints, purgatory, and Sunday observance — were not taught by Jesus Christ.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Change of the Sabbath</h3>
<p>The Church of Rome claims it changed the day of worship from the seventh to the first day of the week. However, both history and the Bible show that the observance of Sunday as a Christian institution originated from paganism.</p>

<h3>The Faithful Remnant</h3>

<p>Despite the compromise and apostasy, there was always a <strong>faithful remnant</strong> who:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Had the faith of Jesus</li>
    <li>Kept the commandments of God</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Church of the Dark Ages</h2>

<p>By the sixth century, the bishops of Rome held power over most of the Christian churches. This strong leadership was known as the <strong>papacy</strong>, with the pope as its head. In <strong>538 AD</strong>, papal power became supreme and ruled for a period of <strong>1260 years</strong>, as predicted by Daniel and John in their prophetic books. This period of papal supremacy ended in <strong>1798</strong>, when the pope of Rome was taken prisoner.</p>

<h3>Persecution and the Dark Ages</h3>

<p>Through secular authority, the church forced the followers of Jesus to choose either to accept the false doctrines and pagan ceremonies of Catholicism or to suffer imprisonment — and perhaps death — by the sword or by burning at the stake. This long period of history is known as the <strong>Dark Ages</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
    “The noon of the papacy was the midnight of the world.” — <em>J. A. Wylie, quoted in GC 60</em>
</blockquote>

<h3>Faithful Witnesses Amid Darkness</h3>

<p>Despite the darkness that covered the earth during the long period of papal supremacy, the <strong>light of truth</strong> could not be completely extinguished. In every age, there were witnesses for God — men who:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Cherished faith in Christ as the only mediator between God and man</li>
    <li>Held the Bible as the only rule of life</li>
    <li>Hallowed the true Sabbath</li>
</ul>

<p>Their contributions to the world remain immeasurable, though often unrecognized. They were:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Branded as heretics</li>
    <li>Their motives impugned</li>
    <li>Their characters maligned</li>
    <li>Their writings suppressed, misrepresented, or mutilated</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, these faithful individuals stood firm. From age to age, they maintained their faith in its purity, preserving it as a sacred heritage for future generations.</p>

<blockquote>
    “How much the world owes to these men, posterity will never know.” — <em>GC 61</em>

<h2>The Church of the Reformation</h2>

<p>“In lands beyond the jurisdiction of Rome there existed for many centuries bodies of Christians who 
remained almost wholly free from papal corruption... These Christians believed in the perpetuity of 
the law of God... Churches that held to this faith and practice existed in Central Africa and among 
the Armenians of Asia.”</p>

<h3>The Waldenses: Defenders of Truth</h3>

<p>“But of those who resisted the encroachments of the papal power, the <strong>Waldenses</strong> stood foremost. In 
the very land where popery had fixed its seat, there its falsehood and corruption were most 
steadfastly resisted... The Waldenses were among the first of the peoples of Europe to obtain a translation of the <strong>Holy 
Scriptures</strong>... Behind the lofty bulwarks of the mountains — in all ages the refuge of the persecuted 
and oppressed — the Waldenses found a hiding place. Here the light of truth was kept burning amid 
the darkness of the Middle Ages. Here, for a thousand years, witnesses for the truth maintained the 
ancient faith...”</p>

<h3>John Wycliffe: The Morning Star of the Reformation</h3>

<p>“John Wycliffe was the herald of reform, not for England alone, but for all Christendom. The great 
protest against Rome which it was permitted him to utter was never to be silenced.... When 
Wycliffe’s attention was directed to the Scriptures, he entered upon their investigation with the same 
thoroughness which had enabled him to master the learning of the schools...”</p>

<blockquote>
    “God had appointed to Wycliffe his work. He had put the word of truth in his mouth, and He set a 
    guard about him that this word might come to the people. His life was protected, and his labors were 
    prolonged, until a foundation was laid for the great work of the Reformation... Wycliffe was one of the 
    greatest of the reformers” — <em>(GC 63-66, 80, 81, 92-94)</em>
</blockquote>

<h3>John Huss and Jerome: Martyrs for Truth</h3>

<p>John Huss was one of the members of the church of the Reformation who read and believed the 
writings of John Wycliffe. When he became a priest, he exposed unscriptural teachings of the 
church, and his preaching aroused the interest of hundreds of students from all parts of Bohemia 
and Germany. Huss was burned at the stake, as eventually was Jerome, his companion and 
supporter.</p>

<h3>Martin Luther: The Just Shall Live by Faith</h3>

<p>The greatest impetus to the church of the Reformation period came from the courage and faith of 
<strong>Martin Luther</strong>. At the age of 21, Luther was already an accomplished scholar. He read the Latin 
Bible — the first Bible he had ever seen — and memorized portions of Scripture. Dramatically, he came 
to the realization:</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>“The just shall live by faith.”</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>On <strong>October 31, 1517</strong>, Luther nailed to the heavy wooden door of the Wittenberg Castle Church a list 
of ninety-five theses, or statements, of doctrine. These were later printed and sent all over Europe.</p>

<blockquote>
    “I cannot and I will not retract, for it is unsafe for a Christian to speak against his conscience. 
    <strong>Here I stand, I can do no other; may God help me. Amen.”</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>The church of the Reformation expanded due to the translation of the Bible into German 
by Martin Luther.</p>

<h3>Other Key Reformers</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Philip Melanchthon</strong>: A close friend of Luther and a teacher at Wittenberg, he helped draft the <strong>Augsburg Confession</strong>, a high point of the Protestant Reformation.</li>
    <li><strong>John Calvin</strong>: A Frenchman who strengthened the Huguenots. From Geneva, Switzerland, many of his students went to Spain, England, and other countries to support the Reformation. His enthusiastic student, <strong>John Knox</strong>, shook the foundations of apostasy in Scotland.</li>
    <li><strong>Ulrich Zwingli</strong>: A reformer in Switzerland during Luther's time and pastor of the Cathedral of Zurich. Switzerland became a model of peace and order as a Protestant nation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Reformation in Scandinavia</h3>

<p>In Scandinavia, the Reformation prospered. The <strong>Petri brothers</strong> translated the Bible into Swedish, 
and Sweden became a Protestant country. <strong>John Tausen</strong> preached the Reformation in Denmark, 
and through his work and the translation of the Bible into Danish by <strong>Pedersen</strong>, Denmark also became 
Protestant. The Reformation was further strengthened by Bible translations into other languages.</p>

<h3>William Tyndale and the Printing Press</h3>

<p><strong>William Tyndale</strong> and the printing press gave the common people of England the Bible in their own 
language. The Bible set men in many countries free. Darkness was dispelled by the Word of 
God; ignorance was replaced by the Scriptures.</p>

<h3>Later Reformers: The Wesley Brothers</h3>

<p>Later reformers like <strong>John Wesley</strong> would bring gospel truths into even greater prominence, spreading 
the message of salvation far and wide.</p>

<h2>The Church of the Pilgrim Fathers</h2>

<p>On <strong>September 16, 1620</strong>, approximately one hundred pilgrims — men and women of iron-willed religious fervor — set sail on the <em>Mayflower</em> for what is now known as the United States of America.</p>

<p>Their journey of faith was driven by a desire for <strong>religious liberty</strong>. This courageous voyage paved the way for future advocates of freedom, such as <strong>Roger Williams</strong>.</p>

<p>Roger Williams later founded the colony of <strong>Rhode Island</strong>, establishing the first settlement in America with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A republican form of government</li>
    <li>Full religious freedom</li>

<h2>The Church of the First Missionaries</h2>

<p>The father of modern missions was <strong>William Carey</strong> of England (1761–1834). As a young man, he repaired shoes, and above his workbench, he had a large map of the world on the wall. The shoemaker was inspired to sail to foreign lands by the reports of Captain Cook’s voyages.</p>

<p>A sermon he preached to a group of ministers resulted in the formation of the first missionary society, and Carey sailed as a pioneer missionary to India. Despite many reverses, he translated portions of the Scriptures and laid the foundation for modern missions.</p>

<h3>The Rise of Modern Missions</h3>

<p>As the nineteenth century dawned, the Protestant churches became <strong>mission-conscious</strong>. Societies for the support of missions began to develop in many lands. No fewer than seven societies were established in England and America during the quarter of a century following the founding of the <strong>Church Missionary Society</strong> in 1799. The era of modern missions had begun.</p>

<h3>Pioneers of Modern Missions</h3>

<p>Among those who suffered privation and loss to extend the gospel boundaries are the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>William Carey</strong> — First missionary to India.</li>
    <li><strong>Robert Morrison</strong> — Prepared an English/Chinese dictionary and published the Bible.</li>
    <li><strong>Adoniram Judson</strong> — Translated the Bible into Burmese; also served in India.</li>
    <li><strong>David Livingstone</strong> — Opened Africa for Christianity.</li>
    <li><strong>Robert Moffat</strong> — Pioneer worker in Africa.</li>
    <li><strong>John Williams</strong> — Pioneered with the boat, <em>The Messenger of Peace</em>, in the South Pacific.</li>
    <li><strong>John G. Paton</strong> — His life was threatened by cannibals fifty-three times in the South Pacific Islands.</li>

<h2>The Church of the Adventists</h2>

<p>The great apostolic doctrine of <strong>Christ’s second coming</strong>, the revival of interest in this event by the reformers, and the signs indicating its nearness formed the background for the preaching of the <strong>second advent</strong> early in the nineteenth century.</p>

<h3>The Work of William Miller</h3>

<p>The work of <strong>William Miller</strong> was of first importance in this movement. Men in various lands arose, preaching the second coming of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<h3>Biblical Foundation</h3>

<p>Christ’s coming to earth a second time, as <strong>King of Kings</strong>, was foretold by the prophets of the <strong>Old Testament church</strong>. This became a recurring theme in the <strong>New Testament church</strong>.</p>

<h3>Hope Through the Ages</h3>

<p>Through centuries of persecution and martyrdom, the hope of Christ’s return strengthened Christians in the church of the <strong>Dark Ages</strong>. The reformers believed the prophecies of this event and recorded their assurance that time would not be long before Jesus returned.</p>

<h3>The Great Religious Awakening</h3>

<p>Today, His <strong>second advent</strong> has become the dominant theme in many parts of the Christian church, inspiring a great religious awakening. This exciting section of church history will be explored further in the next section of the <strong>Church Heritage</strong> course.</p>

<h2>The Church of the Remnant</h2>

<p>The term <strong>remnant</strong> is a Bible word used to describe the church in the last period of earth’s history. Just as a remnant piece of material is the last piece of a roll of cloth, the remnant church is the last part of the church through the ages. The remnant piece of cloth is identical to the cloth at the beginning of the roll; similarly, the remnant church is the same true church God has had in the world throughout history.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of the Remnant Church</h3>

<p><em>In the book of Revelation, John describes many characteristics of the remnant church:</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>They <strong>keep the commandments of God</strong> — <em>Revelation 12:17</em></li>
    <li>They have the <strong>testimony of Jesus Christ</strong>, or the spirit of prophecy — <em>Revelation 12:17; 19:10</em></li>
    <li>They proclaim the <strong>three angels’ messages</strong> to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people — <em>Revelation 14:6-12</em></li>
    <li>They call attention to the <strong>judgment hour of God</strong> — <em>Revelation 14:7</em></li>
    <li>They announce that <strong>spiritual Babylon is fallen</strong> — <em>Revelation 14:8</em></li>
    <li>They warn men and women against receiving the <strong>mark of the beast</strong> — <em>Revelation 14:9-10</em></li>
    <li>They have the <strong>patience of the saints</strong> — <em>Revelation 14:12</em></li>
    <li>They have the <strong>faith of Jesus</strong> — <em>Revelation 14:12</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Mission of the Remnant Church</h3>

<p>The remnant church is called to:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.” — <em>Jude 3</em>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the church is to continue the work of the Protestant Reformation. It must put the "protest" back in Protestant and lead men and women to protest against substituting tradition for Bible truth. The church must announce the reforms outlined in God's Word, guiding people to walk in the light of Scripture rather than the teachings of man.</p>

<h3>The Remnant Church and the Second Advent</h3>

<p>God has ordained that a movement will preach the everlasting gospel and the third angel’s message to the entire world before the second coming of Jesus. Just as John the Baptist was the herald of Christ’s first coming, the remnant church is to be the herald of His second coming:</p>

<blockquote>
    “There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.” — <em>John 1:6</em>
</blockquote>

<p>The Bible also foretells the existence of a remnant church — a movement sent from God.</p>

<h3>The Teachings of the Remnant Church</h3>

<p>The teachings of the <strong>Seventh-day Adventist Church</strong> align with the teachings of the Christian church throughout history. As you study the Bible, you will find that fundamental truths — such as salvation by grace through faith, the judgment, the seventh-day Sabbath, baptism by immersion, tithing, the gift of prophecy, the second advent, and the unconscious state of the dead — have been upheld by the church in every era.</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus Himself, our supreme example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Was baptized by immersion</li>
    <li>Kept the Sabbath</li>
    <li>Taught the sanctity of marriage</li>
    <li>Emphasized the responsibility to pay tithe</li>
    <li>Warned of a coming judgment</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the same teachings upheld by the Seventh-day Adventist Church today.</p>

<h3>God’s People and the Remnant Church</h3>

<p>God’s people are found in all religious persuasions. They are those walking in the light of His Word as best as they understand. When sincere seekers of truth learn about the three angels’ messages in Revelation 14, they will respond and obey. John urges those in spiritual Babylon to come out:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Come out of her, my people.” — <em>Revelation 18:4</em>
</blockquote>

<p>God desires His people to join the remnant church, to be witnesses to His truth, and to prepare for Jesus’ second coming.</p>

<h3>A Personal Call to You</h3>

<p>You have the privilege of being part of the remnant church. With this privilege comes a God-given responsibility to live up to the light you have received. As you continue studying the history and mission of the remnant church in the following pages, you will witness God’s leading in its organization and work.</p>

<p>Make a decision today — by the grace of the Lord Jesus — to be a true representative of His remnant church and stand firm in faith, singing:</p>

<blockquote>
    “Faith of our fathers! living still...<br>
    We will be true to thee till death.”
