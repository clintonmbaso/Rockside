                                                      </strong>The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of God, given by divine inspiration through holy men of God who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to man the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the test of experience, the authoritative revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God's acts in history. (2 Peter 1: 20,21; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17; Psalm 119:105; Proverbs 30:5,6; Isaiah 8:20; John 10:35; 17:17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; Hebrews 4:12.). <br>

                                                      <strong>8.For what purpose were the Scriptures written? </strong><br>

“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” 2 Tim. 3: 16. <br>

“Neither have I gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.” Job 23: 12. <br>

“And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.” Luke 24: 27. <br>

“And He said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto you, whi1e I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me.” Verse 44. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>14.What does God's character preclude Him from doing? </strong><br>
“In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.” Titus 1: 2. <br>

“He is the Rock, His work is perfect: for all His ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is He.” Deuteronomy 32: 4. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>16.What, therefore, must he the character of His Word? </strong><br>

                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>17.What test should therefore be applied to every professed teacher of truth? </strong><br>
“To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.” Isaiah 8: 20. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>18.What does God design that His Word shall be to us in this world of darkness, sin, and death? </strong>“Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path!' Psalm 119: 105. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>19.To what extent has God magnified His Word? </strong><br>
“Thou hast magnified Thy Word above all Thy name.” Psalm 138: 2. <br>
Note-God did this by backing His promises with an oath based on Himself Hebrews 6:13,14. By this He pledged and placed at stake His name, or character, for the fulfilment of His word. <br>
                                                      <br>

“Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.” Psalm 119: 54. <br>

                                                      <strong>What did Christ say to the Jews concerning the study of the Scriptures? </strong><br>
“Search the Scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.” John 5: 39. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>2.For what were the Bereans commended? </strong><br>
“These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so.” Acts 17: 11. <br>
                                                      <br>
Note-”If God's Word were studied as it should be,” says a modern Bible student, “men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose that are rarely seen in these times. But there is little benefit derived from a hasty reading of the Scriptures. One may read the whole Bible through, and yet fail to see its beauty or comprehend its deep and hidden meaning. One passage studied until its significance is clear to the mind and its relation to the plan of salvation is evident, is of more value than the perusal of many chapters with no definite in view, and no positive instruction gained.” <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>3.By what comparison is it indicated that some portions of God's Word are more difficult to </strong>understand than others? <br>
“For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat!' Hebrews 5: 12. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>4.In what way is this comparison further explained? </strong><br>
“For everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the Word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.” Verses 13,14. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>5.What writings are specifically mentioned as containing some things difficult to understand? </strong>“And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures, unto their own destruction.” 2 Peter 3: 15, 16. <br>
                                                      <br>
Note - Some scriptures are too plain to be misunderstood, while the meaning of others cannot so readily be discerned. To obtain a comprehensive knowledge of any Bible truth, scripture must be compared with scripture, and there should be “careful research and prayerful reflection.” But all such study will be richly rewarded. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>6.Who alone comprehends the things of God? </strong><br>
“'For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man ' but the Spirit of God.” 1 Corinthians 2: 11. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>7.How thoroughly does the Spirit search out the hidden treasures of truth? </strong><br>
“But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God!' Verse 10. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>8.What is one purpose for which the Holy Spirit was sent? </strong><br>
“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” John 14: 26. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>9.Why cannot the natural man receive the things of the Spirit? </strong><br>
“But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know because they are spiritually discerned.” 1 Corinthians 2: 14. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>10.For what spiritual enlightenment should everyone pray? </strong><br>
“Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.” Psalm 119: 18. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>11.For what spiritual gift did the Apostle Paul pray? </strong><br>
“That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.” Ephesians 1: 17. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>12.Upon what conditions is an understanding of divine things promised ? </strong><br>
“Yea, if thou cries after knowledge, and lifts up thy voice for understanding; if thou seeks her as silver, and searches for her as for hid treasures; then shall thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God Prov. 2: 3-5. <br>

                                                      <strong>13.What great blessing did Christ confer upon His disciples after His resurrection? </strong><br>
“Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures.” Luke 24: 45. <br>

“If any man will [willeth to, R.V.] to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of Myself!' John 7: 17. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>16.How did Christ reprove those who, though familiar with the letter of the Scriptures, failed to </strong>understand them? <br>
“Jesus answered and said unto them, You do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.” Matthew 22: 29. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>17.What are the Scriptures able to do for one who believes them? </strong><br>
“And that from a child thou has known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus!' 2 Tim. 3:15. <br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>“How Readest Thou?” </strong><br>

IT is one thing to read the Bible through, Another thing to read to learn and do. Some read it with design to learn to read, But to the subject pay but little heed. Some read it as their duty once a week, But no instruction from the Bible seek; While others read it with but little care, With no regard to how they read, nor where. Some read to bring themselves into repute, By showing others how they can dispute; While others read because their neighbors do, To see how long 'twill take to read it through. Some read it for the wonders that are there-How David killed a lion and a bear; While others read it with uncommon care, Hoping to find some contradictions there. Some read as if it did not speak to them, But to the people at Jerusalem. One reads with father's specs upon his head, And sees the thing just as his father said. Some read to prove a pre-adopted creed, Hence understand but little that they read; For every passage in the Book they bend To make it suit that all-important end. Some people read, as I have often thought, To teach the Book instead of being taught; And some there are who read it out of spite. 1 fear there are but few who read it right. But read it prayerfully, and you will see, Although men contradict, God's words agree; For what the early Bible prophets wrote, We find that Christ and His apostles quote. So trust no creed that trembles to recall What has been penned by one and verified by all. <br>

                                                      <strong>Of whom did Christ say the Scriptures testify? </strong><br>
“Search the Scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.” John 5: 39. <br>
Note - 'Search the Old Testament Scriptures: for they are they that testify of Christ. To find Him in them is the true and legitimate end of their study. To be able to interpret them as He interpreted them is the best result of all Biblical learning.” -Dean Alford. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>2.Of whom did Moses and the prophets write? </strong><br>
'Philip finds Nathanael, and says unto him, We have found Him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph.” John 1: 45. <br>
Note-In her translation of the Old Testament Scriptures, Helen Spurrell expressed the following wish for all who should read her translation: “May very many exclaim, as the translator has often done when studying numerous passages in the original, I have found the Messiah!” <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>3.From whose words did Christ say the disciples ought to have learned of His death and resurrection? </strong><br>
“0 fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory?” Luke 24: 25, 26. <br>
                                                      <br>

“And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.” Verse 27. <br>

                                                      </strong> God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became also truly man, Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced temptation as a human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. By His miracles He manifested God's power and was attested as God's promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to minister in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in glory for the final deliverance of His people and the restoration of all things.

A key text in understanding that the Holy Spirit is a Person, is John 14:16, where Jesus promises to send “another Helper (or Comforter)” to His disciples. These two </span><span style="color:#000000;">w</span><span style="color:#000000;">ords - “another” and “Helper”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">- clearly prove the Spirit is indeed </span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Person</span><span style="color:#000000;">.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> The </span><span style="color:#000000;">G</span><span style="color:#000000;">reek w</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#000000;">rd translated “another” (allos), means “another of the same kind.”1 Thus, </span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#000000;">f we be</span><span style="color:#000000;">l</span><span style="color:#000000;">ieve Jesus to be</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">a Person (and, for that m</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#000000;">tter, to be God), then we must believe the Spirit, too, is a Person, and that He is God. To believe otherwise is to make Jesus Christ a mere “power” or “force”- which is obviously false. <br>
                                                      <br>
As a side-n</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#000000;">te, J</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;">sus'</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">use o</span><span style="color:#000000;">f</span><span style="color:#000000;"> the adjective, “another” clearly demonstrates the Holy Spirit is distinct f</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">om the </span><span style="color:#000000;">F</span><span style="color:#000000;">ather and the Son, thus providing support for the doctrine of the Trinity. Further, the word translated “Helper” (parakletos), includes the idea of “one called alon</span><span style="color:#000000;">g</span><span style="color:#000000;">side t</span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#000000;"> help.”2 Surely this indicates anoth</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;">r Person called upon for aid,</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">and not some thing! <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
The Bible Teaches the Holy Spirit is also God <br>
That the Holy</span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Spirit is also God, is revealed throughout the</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> Scriptures. The several passages which speak of the “Spirit of God” or the “Spirit of Christ” and other like ter</span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#000000;">s, all indica</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#000000;">e the Sp</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#000000;">rit is God. The </span><span style="color:#000000;">H</span><span style="color:#000000;">oly Spirit is specifically called “God” in Acts 5:3,4 and “Lord” in 2 Corinthians 3:17,18. Tha</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#000000;"> th</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Holy Spirit is a d</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#000000;">stin</span><span style="color:#000000;">c</span><span style="color:#000000;">t Person from the Father and the Son is seen in several key texts. These texts clearly and unmistakably separate the three Persons of the Godhead. Birth of Jesus announced - Luke 1:26-38.&nbsp; Baptism of Jesus - Matthew 3:16-17. See also: Matthew 28:19; Luke 11:13; John 14:16,26; 15:26; 16:7-15; 1 Corinthians 12:3-6; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2. <br>
If the Holy Spirit were merely God's personal power or force, as some maintain, then it would be redundant for Jesus (Matthew 28:19 and the texts from John's Gospel) and the Apostle Paul (especially 2 Corinthians 13:14), to speak of the three members of the Godhead as they do. The only plausible explanation is that the three-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit-are in fact three distinct Persons, comprising the one and only God. This is the plain teaching of the Bible. <br>
Isaiah the Holy Spirit an impersonal force lacking self-consciousness? Isaiah IT just some kind of power source like electricity or the wind? Or is HE a self-conscious being, the Third Person of the Trinity? The way to answer these questions is to investigate the Scriptures. What follows is a systematic, ten-point, Biblical defense of the full Personality and full Deity of the Holy Spirit. <br>

                                                      <br>
First: <br>
In Acts 13:<strong>1</strong>-</span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>5, the Holy Spirit acts as a Person. </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">He<strong> speaks</strong> to the leaders of the church at Antioch. He instructs them, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which </span><span style="color:#000000;">I</span><span style="color:#000000;"> have called them” (v. 2). Notice the personal references “to Me” and “I.” Th</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Holy Spirit, along with the Antioch lea</span><span style="color:#000000;">d</span><span style="color:#000000;">ers, </span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#000000;">ends </span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#000000;">ut</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">the missionaries (vv. 3, 4). <br>
                                                      <br>
Second: <br>
Throughout the rest of the Book of Acts, the Holy S<strong>pirit is</strong> portrayed as a Person.&nbsp; <br>
                                                      <br>
He had inspired Scripture which had to be fulfilled (1:16).&nbsp; <br>
Ananias lies to the Holy Spirit (5:3). The Spirit bears witness to Jesus (5:32).&nbsp; <br>
Philip is instructed by the Spirit (8:28).&nbsp; <br>
The early believers are comforted by Him (9:31). <br>
The Spirit tells Peter how to act towards the men He has sent (10:19f).&nbsp; <br>
Peter recounts to Cornelius what the Spirit had told Him (11:12).&nbsp; <br>
The decisions of the Jerusalem council are confirmed by the Holy Spirit (15:28).&nbsp; <br>
The Holy Spirit forbids Paul to preach in Asia and Bithynai (16:6f).&nbsp; <br>
He testifies about the “chains and tribulations” awaiting Paul (20:23).&nbsp; <br>
Paul tell</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#000000;"> the elders of the chur</span><span style="color:#000000;">c</span><span style="color:#000000;">h at Ephesiansesus, “. . . the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd th</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;"> church of God . . .” (20:28). <br>
The Holy Spirit again prophesies of the problems</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">about to befall Paul (21:11).&nbsp; <br>
And finally, Paul declares, “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">our fathers . . .” (28:25). <br>
                                                      <br>
Third: <br>
The Holy Spirit exhibits personal trai</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#000000;">s elsewhere i<strong>n the B</strong>ible.&nbsp; <br>
The Spirit “hovers” over the creation (Hebrew--rahap Genesis 1:2, compa</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">e Deut</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">32:11).&nbsp; <br>
He is to send Israel's Redeemer (Isaiah 48:16). <br>
Jesus promises His followers that the Spirit will speak for them when they are being persecuted (Matthew 10:16-20).&nbsp; <br>
The Spirit will teach them what they should say (Luke 12:12). <br>
The Spirit assures believers we are the children of God. He leads us and enables us to cry out “Abba, Father” (Romans 8:14-17).&nbsp; <br>
He intercedes for us befo</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">e the Father</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(Romans 8:26).&nbsp; <br>
He also loves us and enables us to love God and others (Romans 5:5, 15:30). <br>
The Spirit searches “the deep things of God” and knows them (1 Corinthians 2:10f</span><span style="color:#000000;">)</span><span style="color:#000000;">.&nbsp; <br>
He distributes spi</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">itual gifts to all Christians “as He wills” (1 Corinthians 12:11).&nbsp; <br>
And we can have “comm</span><span style="color:#000000;">u</span><span style="color:#000000;">nion” or “f</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;">llowship” with the Holy Spirit (2 Corinthi</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#000000;">ns 13:14;</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">Gr. </span><span style="color:#000000;">k</span><span style="color:#000000;">oinonia). </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Further, we can grieve the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:30).&nbsp; <br>
He instructs us as to what will happen “in the latter times” (I Timothy 4:1).&nbsp; <br>
He witnesses to bel</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#000000;">evers as to the per</span><span style="color:#000000;">f</span><span style="color:#000000;">ection of the sacrifice of Jesus (Hebrews 10:14-17).&nbsp; <br>
He is insulted when people reject what Christ has done (Hebrews 10:29).&nbsp; <br>
As such, the Spirit commands people to accept the free offer of eternal life (Revelation 22:17). <br>
                                                      <br>
Fourth: <br>
Masculine pronouns are used in reference to the Hol<strong>y Spirit</strong> despite the fact that “Spirit” (Greek--pneuma) is neuter (John 14:26; 15:26; 16:8,</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">13f,&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000;">G</span><span style="color:#000000;">reek--ekeinos, literally, that One).&nbsp; <br>
                                                      <br>
Fifth: <br>
Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as “another Helper<strong>” (John</strong> 14: 16). “Another” in the Greek is al</span><span style="color:#000000;">l</span><span style="color:#000000;">os. Greek scho</span><span style="color:#000000;">l</span><span style="color:#000000;">ar Joseph Thayer</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">states,</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">“Allos generally denotes simply a distinction of individuals</span><span style="color:#000000;">.</span><span style="color:#000000;">” This usage is in contrast to a similar word Jesus could ha</span><span style="color:#000000;">v</span><span style="color:#000000;">e spoken but did not--heteros (different). “Heteros involves the secondary idea of difference of kind” </span><span style="color:#000000;">(</span><span style="color:#000000;">Thayer, p. 243). Hence, since Jesus is a Person, the Holy</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">Spirit must be One also. <br>
In addition, the word rendered “Helper” (Greek--parakletos) is applied to Jesus in I John 2</span><span style="color:#000000;">:</span><span style="color:#000000;">1 wher</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;"> it is generally translated as “Advocate.” Thayer writes in reference to both Jesus and the</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">Holy Spir</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#000000;">t being called parakletos,” so of the Holy Spirit destined to take the place of Christ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">with the apostles (after his ascension) . . .” (Thayer, p. 483). Only a Person can take the place of a Pe</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">son. See Acts 9:31 where the early church is said to be “. . . walking in the fear of the Lord and the comfort of th</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Holy Spirit.” “Comfort” is the verb form of the noun parakletos (i.e.. p</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">a</span><span style="color:#000000;">kleses)</span><span style="color:#000000;">.</span><span style="color:#000000;">&nbsp; <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
The Deity of the Holy Spirit&nbsp; <br>
                                                      <br>
First: <br>
The Holy Spirit is </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>equated with God in several pla</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">ce<strong>s in th</strong>e Scriptures. Peter considers lying to the Holy Spirit to be the same as lying to God (Acts 5:3f).&nbsp; <br>
Paul calls the Spirit “the Lord” (2 Corinthians 3:17). Interestingly, the Bible of</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">Jehovah'</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Witnesses (the <br>
New World Translation) renders the phrase “Jehovah is the Spirit.” <br>
The Spirit distributes gifts to Ch</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">istians “as He wills” </span><span style="color:#000000;">(</span><span style="color:#000000;">1 Corinthians 12:11). But it is God who sets </span><span style="color:#000000;">m</span><span style="color:#000000;">embers in t</span><span style="color:#000000;">h</span><span style="color:#000000;">e Church “as He pleases” (1 Corinthians 12:18).&nbsp; <br>
In addition, the Lo</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">d directs our</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">“hearts into the love of God” (2Thes 3:5). Yet, “the love of</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">God has been poured out in </span><span style="color:#000000;">o</span><span style="color:#000000;">ur hearts by the Ho</span><span style="color:#000000;">l</span><span style="color:#000000;">y Spirit” (Romans 5:5). <br>
                                                      <br>
Second: <br>
Christians are the temple of God</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">because the Spirit<strong> dwells </strong>in us (1 Corinthians 3:16).&nbsp; <br>
Further, Paul prays for Christians to “be filled with all the fullness of God” (Ephesians 3:19). B</span><span style="color:#000000;">u</span><span style="color:#000000;">t later, he commands us to “be filled </span><span style="color:#000000;">w</span><span style="color:#000000;">ith the Spirit” (Ephesians 5:18). <br>
                                                      <br>
Third: <br>
The</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">Holy Spirit possesses the</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">attributes of God.&nbsp; <br>
H<strong>e is&nbsp; 	</strong>eternal (Hebrews 9:14),&nbsp;&nbsp; 	omnipresent (Psalm 139:7-10),&nbsp;&nbsp; 	and omnipotent (Luke 1:35-37).&nbsp; <br>
He knows “the deep things of God” so He must also be omniscient (1 Co</span><span style="color:#000000;">r</span><span style="color:#000000;">inthians 2:10f). <br>
                                                      <br>
Fo</span><span style="color:#000000;">u</span><span style="color:#000000;">rth: <br>
The Holy Spirit does the works of God.&nbsp; <br>
Genesis st<strong>ates, “t</strong>he LORD God formed man” (2:7).&nbsp; <br>
But Job proclaimed, “The </span><span style="color:#000000;">S</span><span style="color:#000000;">pirit of God has made m</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;"> . . .” (Job 33:4).&nbsp; <br>
The Holy</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">Spirit calls people to be missionar</span><span style="color:#000000;">i</span><span style="color:#000000;">es and elders (Acts 13:2, 20:28).&nbsp; <br>
But Jesus tells us to pray for “the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harve</span><span style="color:#000000;">s</span><span style="color:#000000;">t” (Matthew 9:38). Peter states that the Scriptures were writ</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#000000;">en as people “were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Peter 1:20f) even though </span><span style="color:#000000;">P</span><span style="color:#000000;">aul informs us that “All Scri</span><span style="color:#000000;">p</span><span style="color:#000000;">ture is God-breathed” (2Tim 3:16; MKJV).&nbsp; <br>
God giv</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;">s The Revelation to Jesus, bu</span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#000000;"> is the Spirit who is speaking to the churches (Revelation 1:1; 2:7). And most importantly, God gives eternal life, although people must be “born of the Spirit” to be saved (1John 5:11; John 3:3-8).&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Further, God choos</span><span style="color:#000000;">e</span><span style="color:#000000;">s us for salvation, and the Holy Spirit guarantees our inheritance (Ephesians 1:3-14). <br>
                                                      <br>
Fifth: <br>
The words of God are considered to be the words of t<strong>he Holy</strong> Spirit. Compare the following sets of verses: Isaiah 6:9f; Acts 28:25-27; /Hebrews 10:15f; Jeremiah 23,33f). <br>
                                                      <br>
Conclusion: <br>
                                                      <br>
In light of all of the preceding information,</span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> there is on</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">l<strong>y</strong> one possible answer to the title of this article--the Holy Spirit is a Person who is God. As such, HE is able to give the believer comfort and direction in life. These things, a “force” could not possibly provide (see Romans 8:14; Acts 9:</span><span style="color:#000000;">3</span><span style="color:#000000;">1).&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">&nbsp; <br>

S0 GOD created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.&quot; Gen. 1:27. This is the Bible record of the beginning of the human race. The method employed in man's creation is also explained: &quot;And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&quot; Gen. 2:7. <br>
Man is declared to be the creation of God. His ancestry stems not from the animal creation, but from the great Creator Himself. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Conflicts with Evolution <br>

These declarations of Scripture are in direct conflict with the present-day theory of evolution through natural selection, which, though entirely unproved, is generally accepted even by members of the Christian churches. <br>
Whether one accepts the theory of creation or the hypothesis of evolution, he, in either case, must have a starting point in his effort to account for human existence. He must go back to some point of beginning. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Begin with God <br>

 The creationist, accepting the Bible record as true, begins with God. He finds in God an allpervading power and person, and from Him he reasons down through all creation. Since God was-all things were possible.&nbsp; <br>
 God claims to be the Creator not only of man, but of all the vast universe as well. &quot;And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of Your hands.&quot; Hebrews 1: l0. <br>
 Of the vast work of creation, the psalmist said: &quot;By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.&quot; &quot;For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.&quot; Psalm 33:6,9. <br>
 One of the prerequisites of acceptance with God is to &quot;believe that He is.&quot; (Hebrews 11: 6.) Once this faith in God's personal existence is established in the heart no trouble is experienced in accounting either for life or for the universe. If God lives, and if He is omnipotent, then everything in nature can easily and readily be attributed to His power and handiwork. He is the ultimate cause of life and of all things, for &quot;without Him was not anything made that was made.&quot; (John 1: 3.) <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Where Does the Critic Begin? </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <br>
 	But not only must the believer in the Bible have a beginning, so must the evolutionist. <br>
Where does he begin? This question confronts him with the greatest difficulty, for since he denies the existence of a personal, all-powerful God, he must seek to find some other satisfactory explanation of life. This is not easy. Having discarded the Bible record, he has to rely upon presumption and speculation. <br>
 Often an evolutionist will say, &quot;Let us suppose that far back in the remote ages of the past, matter and force existed. This force began working upon the matter, and the processes of evolution began.&quot; And there he has his beginning. It is based entirely upon a supposition, absolutely without proof or reason.&nbsp; Why, we ask the evolutionist, do you not go back farther? Why begin after the appearance of force and matter? Who made the matter? Who released the force into the universe? Even these things have to have a beginning. But without God the finite mind cannot think farther back. It becomes lost in a great maze of speculation and finds no satisfactory explanation of life and nature. <br>
 How much more reasonable it is to begin with God and reason down, than with a few molecules of matter and try to reason up to a finished universe and man. Surely the former requires much less faith than the latter. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>They Cannot Understand God <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 	The critics of the Bible story of creation declare that they wish to be guided only by reason: they will believe nothing they cannot reason out. Therefore, since they cannot understand God nor His origin, they refuse to believe in Him at all. But this is not a valid argument. Every man living believes in things he cannot explain or understand. <br>
 Who of us can understand life? What is life? What is it that we have today, and tomorrow departs and leaves the body only an inanimate form? <br>
 &quot;Consider the lilies,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.&quot; Matt. 6:28,29. <br>
 Can anyone really understand the beautiful flowers and active animals, the flora, or the fauna of earth? And yet we all accept them, we love them, we handle them, we appropriate them to our use without question as to how they came into being. <br>
 It is as easy to explain God as it is to explain the beauty of the lily, which rears its snowy white head above the foul miasma of the filthy pool in which it often has its roots, and from the depths of which it draws its life. <br>
 It is true that men cannot explain or understand God. To be able to do so would reduce Him to their own level. Men would be as wise as He. <br>
 &quot;Can thou by searching find out God? Can thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what can thou do? Deeper than hell; what can thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.&quot; Job 11: 7-9. <br>
 God &quot;dwells in a light which no man can approach unto.&quot; He has withdrawn Himself into His vast eternity, but this is no excuse for our refusal to believe in Him. <br>
 	Everything in the universe testifies to the existence of a personal God. Said the psalmist: <br>
 &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork. Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.&quot; Psalm 19: 14. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Missing Link <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Rejecting the Bible teaching that man's ancestry stems from God, the evolutionist is forced to turn to the theory that both man and beast have a common ancestry. He reasons that at first plant life appeared, then came the lower forms of animal life, such as tadpoles, etc. From this beginning there is said to have been a gradual ascent to the higher forms of animal life: frogs, birds, four-footed animals, monkeys, chimpanzees, apes, and finally man. All appeared in succession. <br>
The evolutionist concedes that there is a long gap between the ape and man, and for generations he has been frantically searching for something to fill this gap, in an effort to prove the theory of man's direct ascent from the animal creation. <br>
Some years ago, while the author was in South Africa, Professor Dart, of the Witwatersrand University, sent out a claim to have discovered the long looked for &quot;missing link&quot; -the common ancestor of all modern species. His discovery was a skull, found in the lime beds at Taungs, Bechuanaland -a skull which Professor Dart claimed was of neither anthropoid ape or human being, but an intermediate between the skulls of both in structure and brain capacity. <br>
There appeared at the time a full-page, illustrated article in the Cape Argus of February 7, 1925, under the caption, &quot;Are These, Then, Our Ancestors?&quot; The illustrations were of dinosaurs and a huge gorilla. The question in the title referred to these animals. The implication was that if the skull discovered by Professor Dart was found to be that of a creature neither man nor monkey, but halfway between them in appearance, it would furnish ample proof of the theory that man is the offspring of the brute kingdom and that he did not have a separate creation as recorded in the Scriptures. <br>
Up to that time, the Darwinian theory of the origin of man had been subject to challenge, because there was no tangible evidence anywhere that there had been a transition period when monkeys or some of the lower animals developed into men. The earth had been opened at a thousand places, and millions of pounds had been squandered in the frantic search for the so-called &quot;missing link&quot; between the ape and the man, in an effort to prove the truthfulness of this much vaunted theory of natural evolution. The evidence had not been forthcoming. <br>
 	For years-whenever some unusual skull or other strange bone was unearthed-there was great excitement for a time until the leading scientists were forced to agree that the new find did not quite bridge the gap between man and his supposed ape ancestors. The search went merrily on. <br>
Then Professor Dart appeared with his Taungs skull. <br>
But what had Professor Dart really found? In the same number of the Cape Argus as referred to was found the report of an interview with the English scientist, Professor Keith, who said: <br>
&quot;We want to know when Professor Dart's manlike ape was living. <br>
My own opinion is that it is not perhaps so very old geologically. Then we have to consider what sort of beast it is that Professor Dart has got hold of.... What he has discovered appears to be an unknown form of manlike ape. The photographs impress me with the similarity to the gorilla and the chimpanzee, and the impression I form is that it is really nearer akin to them. <br>
&quot;My opinion is that it probably does not lie in the line of human descent. Between the highest form of anthropoid ape and the lowest form of man there is a huge gap.... But this find of Professor Dart's does not lie, I think, there, but on the border line among the higher apes.&quot; <br>
So what Professor Dart really found was the skull of an ape. Perhaps a bit more manlike in appearance than the apes and monkeys we see today, but still only an ape. Professor Keith did not think that this ape belonged in the huge gap between the lowest forms of man and the highest forms of anthropoid apes, but rather on the border line among the higher apes. In other words, it was a fine specimen of monkey, but it was all monkey and not part man. The &quot;missing link&quot; was still missing. The search had to begin all over again. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Effort to Eliminate God <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Why this frantic attempt to find a connecting link between man and the animal kingdom? It is an effort to get rid of God. The hypothesis that all forms of life came into being through a process of natural evolution, that species have resulted from natural selection, places God in obscurity-in fact, it makes Him unnecessary. It eliminates Him from the original creation and leaves man without proof of His power to regenerate the hearts of men. It lowers man to the lowest forms of life and makes, him a descendant of the brute, instead of a creature formed in the image of God. <br>
For generations, evolutionists have compassed land and sea for evidence of transition from one form of animal life to another, but they have not found it. There is no such process; men all come into being by other means than evolution. This other way corresponds exactly to the Bible plan. <br>
If the Darwinian hypothesis were true-that man had ascended from the brute creation-there should be evidence of it everywhere. All about us would be signs of life in transition from one stage to another. Wherever monkeys or apes are found, we should find many of them partly developed into men. The earth would be literally filled with evidence of this transition. But transition is found nowhere. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After His Kind <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The principle upon which evolution is based makes every living thing to be of the same kind. <br>
The Bible teaches, however, that there are different kinds and that everything reproduces only after its own kind. See Gen. 1: 21, 24, 2 5. We find that in all nature the declarations of God through the Scriptures are vindicated. <br>
The kinds never cross. All man's efforts to make them do so have proved failures. <br>
No man has ever produced a new species. He has never been able to produce a rose from a turnip, nor a pineapple from a stalk of corn. These are not of the same kind. Cattle have never been produced from sheep, nor fowls from swine. These also are not of the same kind. <br>
It is true that man may, by cultivation and selection, increase the beauty and the size of the bloom of the rose or of the lily; he may make it variegated in color, and even change its shape and appearance, but it still is of the same family. It is only made to produce better fruitage of its kind. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Things Have Degenerated <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The geologist proudly boasts that the fossils in the rocks forming the earth's surface will prove the succession of life theory, and yet every spadeful of earth turned over has given the lie to this assertion and has proved that God's law-that everything should produce &quot;after its kind&quot; - has held sway from the beginning. It has further proved that instead of a steady progression upward there has been a steady degeneration. <br>
Thus, the oldest human skeletons found at Gibraltar, in Belgium, and in France are of size and shape to show that their owners had great brain power, and great stature. Professor Horatio Hale, of the Royal Society of Canada, said that cc primitive man showed the highest intellectual powers.&quot; <br>
The geologist George McCready Price declares that &quot;the fossils, regarded as a whole, invariably supply us with types larger of their kind and better developed in every way than their nearest modern representatives, whether of plant or of animal. Our modern plants and animals, whether in the sea or on the land, are degenerate dwarfs.&quot; <br>
Thus, geologists have found that the common frog, for instance, was from six to ten feet long in his primitive state; and some fossils of frogs have been found indicating that the frog's head was about twenty inches in length. The frogs were more powerful than an ox of today. The ancient dragonflies had bodies from twelve to sixteen inches long and had a wingspread measuring two feet. <br>
The elephant was originally about one third taller than the modern ones and about double their weight. The same can be said of plant life. <br>
Sir William Dawson declares, &quot;Nothing is more evident in the history of fossil animals and plants of past geological ages than that persistence of degeneracy is the rule rather than the exception.&quot; Then he adds, &quot;We may almost say that all things left to themselves tend to degenerate, and only a new breathing of the Almighty Spirit can start them again on the path of advancement.&quot; <br>
The eminent English biologist, Thomas H. Huxley, though a world renowned apostle of the evolutionary theory, admitted that the hypothesis cannot be proved. He declared, &quot;In the present condition of our knowledge and of our methods, one verdict (not proved and not provable) must be recorded against all grand hypotheses of paleontologists respecting the general succession of life on the globe.&quot; <br>
Thus, the world is in a maze; and men are floundering about trying in vain to explain the origin of things, but unwilling to accept the theory of divine creation. <br>
Man is not a development of the animal kingdom. He has not been pushed upward by some blind power of force, behind which no mastermind was working. He has, instead, fallen from a high estate of human perfection, as a result of the transgression of the law of our great Creator. <br>
But his case is not hopeless. The One who originally made him again offers to restore His image within him and exalt him to God and His throne. Though made a little lower than the angels, saved man will eventually be exalted far above the angels and will reign with Christ in His glorious kingdom. <br>
Looking heavenward we Christians find inspiration in our lineage, realizing that though fallen yet are we the children of God. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Evolution Destroys Christian Faith <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The teaching that makes man a descendant of the brute, instead of a creature formed in the image of God, at one stroke sweeps away the entire foundation of Christianity. <br>
It destroys faith in the Bible as an inspired revelation and robs God of the glory due Him as Creator. If God's part in the original creation be successfully denied, then we are left without proof of His power in the spiritual re-creation. <br>
It destroys faith in the record of the fall of man and makes of no value the plan of redemption. It destroys the spirit of brotherhood and leads to war and strife. If men really are only the offspring of the brute creation, where is the harm in their destroying one another? <br>
It destroys faith in immortality and the future life. <br>
It makes death an eternal sleep and the resurrection of the dead impossible. <br>
Should, therefore, the theory of evolution be proved, that proof would at once eliminate God and Christ and make the Bible a myth and a deception. <br>

But this theory has not been and cannot be proved. The Bible is still the sure Word of God, and those who build their faith upon it shall never be confounded. <br>
The Word of God will stand for ever. All through the long history of the world, men have arisen who have vaunted themselves against God and have challenged His Word; but they have one and all come to naught. They have withered as the green herb.&quot; They have shared the fate of all who have lifted up their hands against God. <br>
But God's truth goes on forever. It has weathered the storms and criticisms of countless&nbsp; generations, yet it shines brighter today than ever before-the Bible is the most-read book in the world. <br>
So it is with those who believe God's Word. They, too, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">shall never be moved</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">; they have built their house upon a rock, and it will withstand the fiercest storms of doubt and scepticism that can be launched against it. <br>
A strong belief in God and His Word is absolutely essential to an understanding of the origin of man and of the vast universe. It is through faith that the Christian understands, that the worlds were framed by the Word of God. It is by faith that he knows that he was created in God's image. <br>
Man does not spring from the lower orders of life, but he is the handiwork of the Almighty. &quot;For in Him we live, and move, and have our being; ... for we are also His offspring.&quot; Acts 17: 28. <br>
Man is not mere dust of the earth. He is of royal descent. He is kin to God. He is greater than the beasts of the field, over which he was originally given dominion. He is God's masterpiece in the creation connected with this earth, and he had a beginning entirely separate and distinct from the lower forms of life. God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and, thus, he who was formed of the dust of the ground became a living soul. He was God's kind. <br>

 Central to the question of the historicity of the early chapters of Genesis is the question whether the Noahic Flood was global or only regional. A worldwide Flood would have cataclysmically changed the entire surface of the globe, including any fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks that may have been formed prior to that time. Consequently, the earth's present fossiliferous sediments must date largely from the time of their deposition in the waters of the great Flood. <br>
 On the other hand, the modern evolutionary system of earth history denies any such global cataclysm and is based on the assumption of uniform itari a nism. The sedimentary rocks and their fossil contents have been interpreted as evidence of a vast series of evolutionary ages extending over billions of years of time, deposited slowly and generally uniformly over the earth as living organisms gradually evolved into higher and higher forms during those ages. <br>
 	The </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">day-age theory</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> is the attempt by Bible expositors to accommodate these evolutionary ages within the framework of the six days of creation. The </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">gap theory</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> is the attempt by other expositors to accommodate them outside the framework of the six days of creation. Both such theories, if consistent, are associated with the '1ocal flood theory,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> since a universal Flood would have destroyed the sedimentary framework of the geological ages. That is, a universal Flood precludes the historicity of the geological ages, and vice versa. <br>
 	If the Genesis Flood actually was worldwide, then the strained exegesis associated with the dayage and gap theories becomes unnecessary and harmful. In the tabulation below, therefore, are listed one hundred reasons why the Flood should be accepted as a true global cataclysm. <br>

Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity of body, mind, and soul, dependent upon God for life and breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their dependence upon Him and fell from their high position under God. The image of God in them was marred and they became subject to death. Their descendants share this fallen nature and its consequences. They are born with weaknesses and tendencies to evil. But God in Christ reconciled the world to Himself and by His Spirit restores in penitent mortals the image of their Maker. Created for the glory of God, they are called to love Him and one another, and to care for their environment.

 NOTE - If one continued in consciousness after death, he would know of the promotion or dishonor of his sons. But job says he does not know this. Not only so, but in death one loses all the attributes of mind-love, hatred, envy, etc. Thus it is plain that his thoughts have perished, and that he can have nothing more to do with the things of this world. But if, as taught and held by some, man's powers of thought continue after death, he lives; and if he lives, he must be somewhere. Where is he? Is he in heaven, or in hell? If he goes to either place at death, what then is the need of a future judgment, or of a resurrection, or of the second coming of Christ? If the judgment does not take place at death, but men go to their reward at death, then their rewards precede their awards, and there would arise the possibility that some have at death gone to the wrong place, and must needs be sent to the other, after having been in bliss or torment for ages, perhaps. <br>

 NOTE-There is not even a remembrance of God. As already seen, the Bible everywhere represents the dead as asleep. If they were in heaven or in hell, would it be fitting to represent them thus? Was Lazarus, whom Jesus loved, in heaven when the Savior said, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Our friend Lazarus sleeps</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">? John 11:11. If so, calling him to life was really robbing him of the bliss of heaven that rightly belonged to him. The parable of the rich man and Lazarus, recorded in Luke 16, was given to teach, not consciousness in death, but that in the judgment riches will avail nothing unless rightly and beneficently used, and that poverty will not keep one out of heaven. <br>

NOTES - If, as stated in Eccl. 9: 5, the dead know not anything, then they have no knowledge of the lapse of time. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Six thousand years in the grave to a dead man is no more than a wink of the eye to the living.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> To them, consciousness, our only means of measuring time, is gone; and it will seem to them when they awake that absolutely no time has elapsed. And herein lies a most comforting thought in the Bible doctrine of the sleep of the dead, that in death there is no consciousness of the passing of time. To those who sleep in Jesus, their sleep, whether long or short, whether one year, one thousand years, or six thousand years, will be but as if the moment of sad parting were followed instantly by the glad reunion in the presence of Jesus at His glorious appearing and the resurrection of the just. <br>
 It ought also to be a comforting thought to those whose lives have been filled with anxiety and grief for deceased loved ones who persisted in sin, to know that they are not now suffering in torments, but, with all the rest of the dead, are quietly sleeping in their graves. Job 3: 17. <br>
 Again, it would mar the felicity of one's enjoyment in heaven could he look upon earth and see his friends and relatives suffering from persecution, want, cold, or hunger, or sorrowing for the dead. God's way is best-that all sentient life, animation, activity, thought, and consciousness should cease at death, and that all should wait till the resurrection for their future life and eternal reward. See Hebrews 11:39-40. <br>

 The Open Grave - In the city of Hanover, Germany is a tomb known as </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">the open grave.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> It is that of a German countess, who died over a century ago. The grave was covered with a marble block, surmounting large stones bound together with clasps of iron, with this inscription: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">This grave, purchased for eternity, must never he opened.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> But how feeble are all such devices! The Jews had confidence that the grave of Christ was made secure by the Roman seal and Roman guard; and yet one angel, clothed with resurrection power, rolled away the stone, and Jesus came forth. So with this grave in Hanover. It happened, providentially perhaps, that a birch-tree seed fell into a crevice between the massive stones. Soon it sent forth a tender sprout, and a tiny root found its way down between the ponderous stones. Slowly and imperceptibly, but with irresistible power, the young birch grew, until at last its roots burst the bands of iron asunder, and opened this securely sealed tomb, leaving not a single stone in its original position. What a mute, but striking illustration of the promise that, erelong, in God's own time, all graves shall be opened, and the sleeping ones awake from their dusty beds! <br>

 NOTE - Those who give vent to anger or retain old grudges, who parley with temptation or tamper with vice, who indulge in intemperance, pride, foolishness, or levity, or give way to any other weakness, give place to the devil; that is, they give the devil an opportunity to work through them-give him an advantage over them. We should therefore close every avenue to Satan and his angels. We should suppress anger, be sober and watchful, and nip in the bud every prompting to sin. <br>

Far better, also, than the inhabitants of the world, do they know that the end of all things is fast approaching, and that their time to work is short. <br>

This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, endowed with freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, God's adversary, and led into rebellion a portion of the angels. He introduced the spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. This human sin resulted in the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the disordering of the created world, and its eventual devastation at the time of the worldwide flood. Observed by the whole creation, this world became the arena of the universal conflict, out of which the God of love will ultimately be vindicated. To assist His people in this controversy, Christ sends the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect, and sustain them in the way of salvation.

Hence, while we may know of the origin, cause, character, and results of evil, no good or sufficient reason or excuse can be given for it. To excuse it is to justify it; and the moment it is justified it ceases to be sin. All sin is a manifestation of selfishness in some form, and its results are the opposite of those prompted by love. The experiment of sin will result finally in its utter abandonment and banishment forever, by all created intelligences, throughout the entire universe of God. Only those who foolishly and persistently cling to sin will be destroyed with it.

Note ~ Inasmuch as God, who is love, who delights in mercy, and who change,, not, offered pardon and granted a period of probation to man when he sinned, it is but reasonable to conclude that a like course was pursued toward the heavenly intelligences who first sinned, and that only those who persisted in sin, and took their stand in open revolt and rebellion against God and the government of heaven, were finally cast out of heaven.

But He who can bring light out of darkness (2 Corinthians 4: 6), make the wrath of man to praise Him (Psalm 76:10), and turn a curse into a blessing (Deuteronomy 23: 5), can bring good out of evil, and turn mistakes and downfalls into stepping-stones to higher ground.

                                                      <br>
GOD moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform; <br>
He plants His footsteps in the sea, And rides upon the storm. <br>
                                                      <br>
Deep in unfathomable mines <br>
Of never-failing skill, <br>
He treasures up His bright designs, And works His sovereign will. <br>
                                                      <br>
You fearful saints, fresh courage take; The clouds you so much dread Are big with mercy, and shall break In blessings o'er your head. <br>
                                                      <br>
judge not the Lord by feeble sense, But trust Him for His grace; Behind a frowning providence He hides a smiling face. <br>

And He will make it plain-William Cowper. <br>

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> In Christ's life of perfect obedience to God's will, His suffering, death, and resurrection, God provided the only means of atonement for human sin, so that those who by faith accept this atonement may have eternal life, and the whole creation may better understand the infinite and holy love of the Creator. This perfect atonement vindicates the righteousness of God's law and the graciousness of His character; for it both condemns our sin and provides for our forgiveness. The death of Christ is substitutionary and expiatory, reconciling and transforming. The resurrection of Christ proclaims God's triumph over the forces of evil, and for those who accept the atonement assures their final victory over sin and death. It declares the Lordship of Jesus Christ, before whom every knee in heaven and on earth will bow.

Supposing one single man to have left a book of predictions concerning Jesus Christ as to the time and manner of His coming, and supposing Him to have come agreeably to these predictions, the argument would be of almost infinite force; yet here the evidence is stronger beyond all comparison; a succession of men for the space of four thousand years follow one another, without interruption or variation, in foretelling the same great event. A whole people are the harbingers of the Messias, and such a people as subsisted four thousand years to testify in a general body their assured hope and expectation, from which no severity of threats or persecutions could oblige them to depart. This is a case which challenges In a far more transcendent degree our assent and wonder. -Pascal. <br>

Led by the Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of our transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Lord and Christ, as Substitute and Example. This faith which receives salvation comes through the divine power of the Word and is the gift of God's grace. Through Christ we are justified, adopted as God's sons and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin. Through the Spirit we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews our minds, writes God's law of love in our hearts, and we are given the power to live a holy life. Abiding in Him we become partakers of the divine nature and have the assurance of salvation now and in the judgment.

In infinite love and mercy God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, so that in Him we might be made the righ¬teousness of God. Led by the Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of our transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Saviour and Lord, Substitute and Example. This saving faith comes through the divine power of the Word and is the gift of God’s grace. <br>
                                                      <br>
Through Christ we are justified, adopted as God’s sons and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin. Through the Spirit we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews our minds, writes God’s law of love in our hearts, and we are given the power to live a holy life. Abiding in Him we become partakers of the divine nature and have the assurance of salvation now and in the judgment. (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 45:22; 53; Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 33:11; 36:25-27; Hab. 2:4; Mark 9:23, 24; John 3:3-8, 16; 16:8; Rom. 3:21-26; 8:1-4, 14-17; 5:6-10; 10:17; 12:2; 2 Cor. 5:17-21; Gal. 1:4; 3:13, 14, 26; 4:4-7; Eph. 2:4-10; Col. 1:13, 14; Titus 3:3-7; Heb. 8:7 12; 1 Peter 1:23; 2:21, 22; 2 Peter 1:3, 4; Rev. 13:8.)<br>

By His death on the cross Jesus triumphed over the forces of evil. He who subjugated the demonic spirits during His earthly ministry has broken their power and made certain their ultimate doom. Jesus’ victory gives us victory over the evil forces that still seek to control us, as we walk with Him in peace, joy, and assurance of His love. <br>
                                                      <br>
Now the Holy Spirit dwells within us and empowers us. Continually committed to Jesus as our Saviour and Lord, we are set free from the burden of our past deeds. No longer do we live in the darkness, fear of evil powers, ignorance, and meaninglessness of our former way of life. In this new freedom in Jesus, we are called to grow into the likeness of His character, communing with Him daily in prayer, feeding on His Word, meditating on it and on His providence, singing His praises, gathering together for worship, and participating in the mission of the Church. <br>
                                                      <br>
We are also called to follow Christ’s example by compassionately ministering to the physical, mental, social, emotional, and spiritual needs of humanity. As we give ourselves in loving service to those around us and in witnessing to His salvation, His constant presence with us through the Spirit transforms every moment and every task into a spiritual experience.

In continuity with the people of God in Old Testament times, we are called out from the world. And we join together for worship, for fellowship, for instruction in the Word for the celebration of the Lord's Supper, for service to all mankind, and for the worldwide proclamation of the gospel. The church derives its authority from Christ, who is the incarnate Word and from the Scriptures which are the written Word. The church is God's family; adopted by Him as children, its members live on the basis of the new covenant. The church is the body of Christ, a community of faith of which Christ Himself is the Head. The church is the bride for whom Christ died that He might sanctify and cleanse her. At His return in triumph, He will present her to Himself a glorious church, the faithful of all the ages, the purchase of His blood, not having spot or wrinkle, but holy and without blemish.

This remnant announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent. This proclamation is symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14; it coincides with the work of judgment in heaven and results in a work of repentance and reform on earth. Every believer is called to have a personal part in this worldwide witness. (Mark 16:15; Matthew 28:18-20; 24:14; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Revelation 12:17; 14:6-12; 18:1-4; Ephesians 5:22-27; Revelation 21:1-14.) <br>
                                                      <br>
IT IS NOW court week in heaven. Already men are being tried before the great white throne. Over a century has passed since the judge of the Universe took His seat and opened the books of record. Already decisions are being made. The most staggering truth of all, dear reader, is the fact that you and I have a case pending at the bar of God. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> 2 Corinthians 5: 10. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Nations Are Warned <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
But God has not left us without warning. Even now, in mercy, He is sending us an appeal to prepare to stand before Him. John the revelator declared. that as the judgment opened, he saw a mighty messenger with a solemn warning from God arise and hurry quickly to all the nations of earth. This work was carried on with such rapidity that the prophet describes it as an angel flying in the midst of heaven, crying to all the peoples of the world and warning them that the judgment of God had begun in heaven. Let us note his words: <br>
'I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Rev. 14: 6, 7. <br>
Here is a message which is to be heralded to every tribe and nation of earth after the judgment hour has come. It will constitute God's last appeal to the people of earth to turn to Him and be saved. It will prepare a people from among the nations for the return of Jesus, and lead them to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. (Verses 12-16.) It will be a message of reform. As on the day of atonement in the earthly sanctuary service the people were bidden to afflict their souls before God and confess their sins in final preparation for judgment, so this message will lead men and women everywhere to turn to God, in preparation for judgment before the great tribunal of heaven. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Trumpet Sounds <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
In the earthly sanctuary service on the Day of Atonement, a special warning call was given to the people by the continued blasts of trumpets. (Lev.25:9) This was done throughout all the land to make sure that every individual knew that the Day of Atonement had arrived. They were given an opportunity to make lastminute preparation for it. <br>
The great message of Rev. 14:6,7 is the antitypical blowing of trumpets for the real Day of Atonement and final judgment in heaven. As of old, the warning is to sound throughout the land. It is a worldwide message, going to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. <br>
Other Bible prophets also have spoken of this final appeal from God to the nations of earth and have described it in graphic language. <br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Time for the Message <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 As shown previously, the hour struck for the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary and the opening of the judgment at the close of the 2300 year prophecy of Dan. 8:14. This time period ended in 1844. At that time </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">the judgment was set, and the books were opened,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> and the judgment hour message of Revelation 14 was due to be carried to the world. <br>
 	Previous to 1844 it could not have been truly said that the hour of His judgment is come.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Paul reasoned of judgment to come, but never until the judgment actually started could God's servants say that the time for its opening had been reached. This became </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">present truth</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> in 1844; and in that year the great clock of time struck the hour for the angel messenger of Revelation 14 to arise and hasten to the nations with the solemn and soul-piercing cry, 'Tear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The message came at the appointed time. In the very year 1844 that the High Priest entered through the second veil of the sanctuary in heaven to begin the work of final judgment, the light of the sanctuary truth and the judgment broke forth. Companies began to spring up in the New England states that set for themselves the task of heralding the judgment message to the uttermost parts of the earth. These heralds are now to be found on every continent and on most of the islands of the sea. They are laboring under the profound conviction that they have been commissioned of God to give this solemn message, and that their task will be completed simultaneously with the closing of Christ's work in the hall of judgment in the sanctuary above. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A Message of Reform <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 The judgment-hour message is a message of reform, calling men and women away from the paths of sin and worldliness to an acceptance of Christ as their Savior and to the keeping of God's great moral law. This is the reason John exclaims of those who accept the preaching of this message: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Rev. 14:12. They have heard the warning, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Prepare to meet thy God,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> and have by God's grace, squared their lives by the holy precepts of His commandments. <br>
 This great worldwide message of reform, which began upon earth simultaneously with the opening of the judgment in the sanctuary in heaven, must do its entire work while the judgment is in progress. It was therefore necessary that the judgment open long enough before the close of probation and the end of the world to make possible the carrying forward of such a world movement. <br>
 When the message has done its work, and when the great High Priest has completed the work of judgment in the heavenly courts, Jesus will take the golden censer, in which He has offered incense before God with the prayers of His people, and cast it upon the earth. (Rev. 8: 5.) This will indicate that His work of mediation is finished, that the judgment is completed, and that human probation is forever closed. At that time the final decision will be rendered that will fix the destiny of every individual. The voice of mercy will die out of the Earth, and Jesus as King of kings will ride forth upon the clouds of heaven to reap earth's harvest. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Men Still Living on the Earth <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 That the judgment will take place before the second advent of Christ and while people are still living upon the earth is clearly revealed in the Scriptures. Rev. 11: 18 says: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The nations were angry, and Thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that Thou should give reward unto Thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear Thy name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Here the prophet declares that when the time comes for the judgment to open, the nations will be angry. Other scriptures reveal the fact that this anger will burst into fury, and that during the judgment the greatest wars in human history will be fought upon earth, ending in the Battle of Armageddon. John calls it </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">the battle of that great day of God Almighty,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> which opens as the judgment comes to its close. (Rev. 16:14.) <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Standard of the judgment <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 The great judgment-hour message must of necessity incorporate the teaching of the binding claims of God's immutable law upon all men, for this law will be the standard of the final judgment. The supreme test that will be applied to man by the judge of the universe will be to ascertain whether his life is in full accord with the principles of the Ten Commandment code. In the Book of James are recorded the words: <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou does not commit adultery, but kills, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak you, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> James 2: 10-12. R.V. <br>
 It will be seen by the preceding statement that a man's being reckoned guilty or innocent will depend entirely upon whether he has kept the whole law. It is the law that works wrath to the transgressor. If there were no law, all men, and even the devils, would escape sin's penalty, as there would be no instrument of condemnation. But since the law does exist, it serves as a witness to the righteousness of those who, through the power of the indwelling Christ, comply with its requirements. It just as faithfully condemns those who violate, it as being guilty of sin. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The wages of sin is death.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Romans 6: 23. <br>
Referring to the importance of obedience, Christ declared: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Matt. 5: 19, RV. <br>
 That is to say, when a man breaks even one of the least of the commandments and teaches others that it is not necessary for them to keep the moral law, God and the holy angels in heaven count that man least among the people of earth. He is established in sin. But when a man keeps them-all of them himself and teaches others the importance of this obligation, the heavenly host look upon him with approbation. He is called </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">great</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> in the kingdom of heaven. This will be the basis of the decisions in the final judgment. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">This is the end of the matter; all hath been heard: Fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Ecclesiastes. 12:13, RV. A Christian who through faith in Jesus Christ has faithfully kept the law's requirements will be acquitted; there is no condemnation, for the law finds no fault in him. If, on the other hand, it is found that one has broken even a single precept, and this transgression is unconfessed, he will be dealt with just as if he had broken all ten. <br>
 A man's love for the whole law is no stronger than his love for each particular commandment contained in it. Therefore, there is no possibility of his being able to pile upon the ledger of heaven enough good deeds to offset a few willful transgressions, for David declares: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The wicked shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">&nbsp; Psalm 1:5, RV. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sin Separates from God <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Sin separates man from God. Because of sin man was driven out of the Garden of Eden, and became subject to all the woes and miseries of life. God announced when man was first created that sin would not be tolerated in His kingdom. He warned the human family against it. Hence, sin will cause the destruction of the lost in the lake of fire. It was God's desire to save man from this fearful doom that led Him to devise the plan of salvation. Christ came to </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">save His people from their sins,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> and in doing so to remove that which separates man from his Maker. <br>
 In view of the fact that a whole century has passed since the judgment began in heaven, we must be very near its close. Just when your name and mine will be called in review before God, we know not; but it must be very soon. Even now the signs of the times clearly indicate that the hour is growing late and human probation is rapidly drawing to an end. What we do to prepare for the judgment must be done without further delay. To put it off this preparation is perilous. Already we have waited too long. We must now redeem the time lest we be forever too late. <br>
 As Paul reasoned before Felix of a </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">judgment to come,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Felix trembled. This wicked ruler was mightily shaken as he looked into the distant future and contemplated the ordeal of finally appearing before the judge of the universe to give an account of his earthly life. There he would answer for every unjust sentence he, as An earthly judge, had handed down; for every bribe he had taken; for every indulgence in sin and iniquity. <br>
 But we, too, are judgment bound. We, too, must appear at His judgment seat. We, too, must face our records as we stand before the judge. <br>
 The investigation of the records of men will be exceedingly thorough. Paul declared that God will both </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and . . . make manifest the counsels of the hearts.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> 1 Corinthians 4:5. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? Said the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and earth? Said the Lord.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Jeremiah 23:24. , <br>
 No, we cannot hide our secrets from God. He sees all we do and hears all we say, and the hands of the angel recorders keep faithful and accurate records of even the least details of our lives. Thus, every work shall be brought </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> for it is by these records that we shall be judged. (Ecclesiastes. 12: 14.) <br>
 Sin may lie buried in the secret recesses of the heart where no one can see or discern it-even our bosom companions may not know. It is completely hidden from man, but never from the eye of God.&nbsp; </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">0 Lord, Thou has searched me, and known me. Thou knows my down sitting and mine uprising, Thou understands my thought afar off. Thou compasses my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, 0 Lord, Thou knows it altogether. Thou has beset me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there. If I take the. wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. Yea, the darkness hides not from Thee; but the night shines as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to Thee.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Psalm 139:1-12. <br>
 It is not necessary that our records of sin remain to plague us in the judgment. Jesus offers todayeven as you read these words-to take them all away, cleanse the heart from all defilement, and impute His righteousness. He offers to exchange His beautiful garments of salvation for our filthy rags. Yes, He even offers to blot out our sins and </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">remember them against us no more for ever.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Repent you therefore, and be converted,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> is His loving entreaty, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">that your sins may be blotted out.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Acts 3: 19. <br>
 Christ is not willing that any should perish but that all men should come to repentance. He tasted death for every man. He has provided salvation for all who will receive it. But He cannot force the will. We must accept Him willingly, or we will be left to perish in our sins. <br>
 He waits today to save. His nail-scarred hands are still outstretched in loving invitation, and His voice still may be heard pleading, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Whosoever will, let him come.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>

In Christ we are a new creation; distinctions of race, culture, learning, and nationality, and differences between high and low, rich and poor, male and female, must not be divisive among us. We are all equal in Christ, who by one Spirit has bonded us into one fellowship with Him and with one another; we are to serve and be served without partiality or reservation. Through the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Scriptures we share the same faith and hope, and reach out in one witness to all. This unity has its source in the oneness of the triune God who has adopted us as His children.

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our death to sin and of our purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Savior, become His people, and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. (Matthew 3:13-16; 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38; 16:30-33; 22:16; Romans 6:1-6; Galatians 3:27; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Colossians 2:12, 13; 1 Peter 3:21.) <br>
AND NOW why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Acts 22: 16. <br>
Baptism is an ordinance of the new dispensation. It is not a shadow of something yet to come as were the ordinances of the Old Testament, but is, instead, a great memorial, testifying to the fact that Christ's sacrifice on Calvary has been made and that the participant in the ordinance believes this to be the assurance of his acceptance with God. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Romans 6: 3-8. <br>
Baptism represents two outstanding events: firstly, Christ's death, burial, and resurrection; secondly, a death to sin, a burial of the old nature, and a spiritual resurrection on the part of those accepting Christ. We are baptized into His death. We are buried with Him by baptism. We shall be in the likeness of His resurrection. <br>
 Conversion not only brings a </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">new-birth</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> experience to the sinner, but also a definite death to the old life of sin. He must not only turn to something new, but he must turn away from and repudiate something old. The old man of sin must be put to death. Not only does the individual become </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">a new creature,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> but it is just as true that </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">old things are passed away.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Of this experience the Apostle Paul speaks with great clarity: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Gal. <br>
5:24,25. <br>
 	The old man is crucified; henceforth the individual is not to serve sin. See Romans 6: 6. <br>
 From the time of conversion the individual is to live a changed life. The things he once loved and cherished are now to be forsaken and forgotten. The flesh is crucified, with the affections and lusts. He no longer loves sin and the ways of wickedness. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">All things are become new.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Thus baptism has for the twice-born man a double significance. It not only becomes a means by which he may express his faith in the sacrificial death of Jesus for his sins, but it also testifies to an actual personal experience through which he himself passes in becoming a child of God. <br>
 What a beautiful and fitting Illustration of all this is found in the ordinance of baptism! How perfectly has God provided for the sinner's every need ! <br>
 Just as Christ died for men's sins, was buried, and three days later was resurrected, so the repentant sinner dies a spiritual death to sin, buries' the old life in the waters of baptism, and arises again in the likeness of His resurrection. He has been baptized into Christ. With him all things have become new. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A Required Ordinance <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Baptism is a required ordinance. <br>
 When Jesus gave the great gospel commission to His church, He bade them: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Matt. 28: 19. Mark's Gospel quotes Jesus as saying: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Mark 16: 16. <br>
 	Surely such language as this would never have been used by Jesus in speaking of an ordinance that had little or no meaning, or that was not essential in the plan of redemption. <br>
 True, the performance of the ordinance of baptism alone will not save an individual from his sins, but it serves as a symbol of a spiritual -Cleansing. <br>
 When Saul of Tarsus was converted, God's servant Ananias admonished him to be baptized and wash away his sin. It had some significance in the work of conversion and regeneration. The actual cleansing from sin is, of course, accomplished by the blood of Christ. This is the fountain that has been opened for sin and uncleanness. The sinner has redemption through His blood. (Ephesians 1: 7.) His sinstained robes are washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. (Rev. 7: 14.) But just as it was necessary for those under the old dispensation to have an ordinance through which they could express their faith in the atoning blood, so it is needful for those who live this side of the cross. They did it by shedding the blood of a lamb; modern Christians by passing through the waters of baptism. <br>
 	To this agrees the further testimony of Peter, where he declares: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> 1 Peter 3: 21. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Baptized Into Christ <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 In Romans 6: 3, as in other scriptures, it is stated that when the repentant sinner is baptized, he is </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">baptized into Jesus Christ.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Professor Sauter, an authority on New Testament Greek, informs us that certain old papyrus manuscripts show that wherever this expression occurs in the New Testament, the person baptized becomes the property of the divine person indicated. Thus baptism serves not only as a testimony that the individual has renounced his old life of sin, but also that from henceforth he is the personal property of his Redeemer. His allegiance has been changed. He is now a child of the King. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Prerequisites to Baptism <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 The prerequisites to the ordinance of baptism are faith, repentance, and a full acceptance of Jesus Christ as a personal Savior. Jesus said, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">He that believes and is baptized shall be saved.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> The believing must precede the ordinance. Without faith in God and in Christ as man's Savior, going through the mere motions of this ordinance would be of no avail. It would become a dead form. It would be only as sounding brass and tinkling cymbal. <br>
 Infant baptism, therefore, is not Scriptural. Before this ordinance is administered to a child, he should first be given time to grow up to the age of personal responsibility. He should be carefully taught, the Word of God and, if possible, so led to a full acceptance of the gospel. The child should be old enough to recognize fully the fact of sin, his need of a personal Savior, and that Christ Jesus alone can accomplish his redemption. <br>
 The child is not responsible for his sins until he comes to the age of accountability and understanding. Therefore, the ordinance of baptism would have no meaning in his life until this period was reached. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">He that comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 11: 6. Only those who have reached the age at which faith becomes possible are eligible to take part in this important and meaningful ordinance. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Bible Way <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 	The only mode of baptism recognized in the New Testament is immersion. The Greek word </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">baptizo,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> from which our English word </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">baptism</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> is derived, means to immerse, to overwhelm, or to plunge beneath. <br>
 Dr. Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, of the Church of England, in his Christian Institutions, states that </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">for the first thirteen centuries [after Christ] the almost universal practice of baptism was that of which we read in the New Testament, and which is the very meaning of the word 'baptize'-that those who were baptized were plunged, submerged, immersed into the water.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Pages 256, 257. <br>
 This was the manner in which Jesus was baptized. At that time John the Baptist was baptizing converts in the Jordan River. Hundreds were flocking from Jerusalem, Judea, and all the region round about to be baptized by him. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Then comes Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbade Him, saying, I have need to be baptized of Thee, and come Thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered Him. And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon Him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">, Matt. 3: 13-17. <br>
 There are a number of most vital and interesting facts brought out in this record of Jesus' baptism. Firstly, He was baptized in Jordan. He journeyed all the way from Galilee to Jordan to find a proper place for baptism. Secondly, when He had been baptized, He </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">went up straight way out of the water.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> This clearly indicates that the method of administering this ordinance to Jesus was by immersion, since He had gone into the water to be baptized. Lastly, as God the Father in heaven looked upon the scene, He approved of what was done, and spoke directly from His throne to those who stood by, saying, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Thus, Jesus, who is the example in all things, passed through the waters of baptism and was immersed, thereby illustrating His death, burial, and resurrection which were soon to be experienced for man's salvation. <br>
 The same form of baptism was also administered by Philip the evangelist when, under the guidance of the Spirit of God, he led the Ethiopian eunuch to an acceptance of Jesus. After being convinced of the eunuch's sincerity and faith, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Acts 8: 3 8, 39. <br>
 John the Baptist, with whose ministry the ordinance of baptism was instituted, recognized that in order to administer this sacred ordinance properly it was essential to have much water. Usually he baptized in the Jordan, though at times he shifted the scene of his activities to other localities; but in doing so he chose places suitable for baptismal services. Thus it is recorded of him: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">And John also was baptizing Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John 3: 23.&nbsp; Sprinkling or pouring for baptism was not introduced into the church for hundreds of years after the early Christian church passed off the stage of action. Therefore, these forms have no basis either in Scriptural teaching or in the example of Christ's followers. They are among the errors that crept into the church during the period known as the Dark Ages, that resulted from the great apostasy foretold by the Apostle Paul. See 2 Thessalonians. 2: 3, 4, 7. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A Marriage Ceremony <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Baptism may well be likened to the marriage ceremony. A young man and woman indicate their desire to be united in marriage. Why? Because they have come to love each other. Their hearts are already united. They have decided that they desire each other's companionship for life-till death do them part. They have agreed together that leaving all others they will cling to each other so long as they both shall live. The spiritual bond already exists. <br>
 But to make their marriage legal there must be a wedding ceremony. They must publicly pledge their troth to each other. They must through the marriage service announce to the world their decision to live together. It must be understood by society, and a record of their union must go into the archives of the county or state. <br>
 	Just so it is with baptism. A sinner hears the voice of Jesus calling, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Give Me thy heart.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> He soon finds himself being drawn to Christ by the cords of love. He learns to love Jesus because Jesus first loved him, and gave His life a ransom for him. Jesus offers him pardon, cleansing, a new heart, and the gift of immortality-all this without money and without price. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Come now,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> pleads the voice of Jesus, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">and let us reason together, . . . though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Isaiah 1: 18. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him., and will sup with him, and he with Me.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Rev. 3: 20. <br>
 The sinner can resist no longer. He surrenders his heart, soul, and body to his Redeemer. He decides to follow Jesus, even to death. Henceforth, nothing shall be able to separate them because Jesus has keeping power as well as saving power. The deed is done., He has become a Christian. <br>
 No, not entirely done. One thing yet is lacking. He must not, like Nicodemus, be a disciple secretly. There Must be a' marriage ceremony. He must announce to the world his changed allegiance. He must make a public confession of Christ before men. (See Matt. 10: 3 2.) Then he will in very fact become the property of Christ, just as the husband and wife are the property of each other. <br>
 This public ceremony is baptism. Through this ordinance men are publicly wedded to Christ and enter into full fellowship with Him, as well as with His church upon earth. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness: and thou shall know the Lord.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hosea 2: 19, 20. <br>
 Therefore. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">as many ... as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Gal. 3: 27. They constitute His bride. To them He grants that they should be arrayed with fine linen, white and clean, which is the righteousness of the saints. They have become candidates for heaven, and if through His' grace they remain true and faithful to the baptismal vow, His promise to them is that they shall walk with Him in white in His kingdom. <br>
 'Thou has a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy. He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Rev. 3: 4, 5. <br>

It is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus for our redemption. See Romans 6: 3-8. <br>
NOTE - Just as Christ died for the sins of the world, was buried in the tomb, and was resurrected again, so the sinner must die a spiritual death to sin; his old life must be symbolically buried in the waters of baptism, and then he must be raised from the watery grave to live a new life in Christ Jesus. <br>

Immersion. The Greek root word </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">baptizo</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> means to dip, to plunge, to immerse. <br>

Burial beneath the water, entirely hidden from the world, the eyes closed and breath held, just as in a real burial, then raised again from the water, opening the eyes, catching the breath, and again associating with loved ones, just as in an actual resurrection. <br>

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> The Lord's Supper is a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Savior. In this experience of communion Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people. As we partake, w joyfully proclaim the Lord's death until He comes again. Preparation for the Supper includes self-examination, repentance, and confession. The Master ordained the service of foot washing to signify renewed cleansing, to express a willingness to serve one another in Christ like humility, and to unite our hearts in love. The communion service is open to all believing Christians. (Matthew 26:17-30; 10:16, 17; John 6:4863; Revelation 3:20; John 13:1-17.) <br>
                                                      <br>
IT WAS Jesus' last evening with His chosen disciples. They had all come together to eat the Jewish Passover. Before morning the Lamb of God would be in the hands of the infuriated mob. Judas had already been plotting His betrayal. The stage was set for His great humiliation, but knowing all that was before Him, Jesus chose this auspicious occasion to introduce to His disciples the new ordinances (other than baptism) that were to be recognized and celebrated in the new church, following His crucifixion and resurrection. These ordinances are a part of the worship of Christian churches in all parts of the world even to these days. <br>
In a few short hours His death would bring the ceremonies and types of the old Jewish economy to their end; and, the post crucifixion ordinances must be established in the church before His death, to be ratified by the shedding of His blood. This was in accord with a plan that had been in the mind of the Father and the Son for ages past. <br>
The new ordinances would include the breaking and eating of unleavened bread as an emblem of Christ's broken body and the drinking of sweet grape wine as an emblem of His blood that was to be shed for sinners. These ceremonies were emblematic occasions pointing the believer back to Christ's offering. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Jesus Washed the Disciples' Feet <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 This holy ordinance (the Lord's supper) was, however, to be preceded by a ceremony of washing with water, typifying the cleansing away of sin by the blood of Jesus. This washing ceremony was to be observed in addition to the ordinance of baptism. The latter was to be celebrated only once-at conversion; the former from time to time as the church should meet to partake of the emblems of the bread and wine at the Lord's table. <br>
 Baptism would represent the big cleansing-when the blood of Christ covered and cleansed away all the past guilt of a sinful life. This additional ceremony would represent the lesser. but none the less important, work of cleansing the followers of Christ from sin and defilement that would accumulate in the life from day to day, following the ordinance of baptism. <br>
 	Of the institution of this ordinance of cleansing, we find a clear record in John's Gospel when he says: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Now before the feast of the pass over, when Jesus knew that His hour was come that He should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Him; Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He was come from God, and went to God; He rises from supper, and laid aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded Himself. After that He pours water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John 13: 1-5. <br>
 This was the work of a servant. Before gathering to eat the Passover feast, the members of Jesus' company had taken a full bath; for thus it was prescribed in the law of Moses, with which law He was now complying for the last time. Travelling with open sandals on their bare feet over the dusty paths en route to the place where the Passover was to be eaten, they had accumulated a certain amount of dust on their feet; and it was customary for a servant to perform the service of washing the feet of the guests as they arrived.&nbsp; No servant being present on this occasion, this service was not performed. It was clearly the duty of some one of the disciples to accept the role of a servant and carry out this menial task, but not one of them was willing to do so. Their hearts were still filled with selfishness and the desire for high rank in the kingdom. Not one of them would humble himself to the point of accepting a servant's role. <br>
 As they sat at the Passover table and ate the flesh of the roasted lamb that typified Jesus in His sacrificial death for sinners, He read their selfish, proud hearts. He desired to rebuke their pride and teach them that true greatness is measured by one's willingness to serve others. Already He had said to them: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">He that is greatest among you shall be your servant.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> And again, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">He that shall humble himself shall be exalted.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Jesus also recognized that the disciples were not in a proper spiritual condition to partake of the holy emblems of bread and wine and that there was need for deep heart searching on their part that they might make suitable preparation for this new and meaningful service. Concerning this He a little later said to them: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> 1 Corinthians 11: 27-29. <br>
 	With these considerations before Him, Jesus arose from the Passover table and began to wash His disciples' feet, as astonishment and self -condemnation filled their hearts. They had proudly declined this humble service, but now their Lord and Master was freely performing it. He had taken upon Himself </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">the form of a servant,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> and was revealing His greatness through His great humility. <br>
 Peter watched in astonishment as Jesus washed the feet of some of the others. Now He came also to him, and Peter, overcome with shame and remorse, exclaimed, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Lord, does Thou wash my feet?</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">&nbsp; Peter felt he could not possibly permit his Master to perform for him such a menial service. Surely this was far beneath his Lord's dignity. Was not Christ the Son of David? Was He not about to wrest the kingdom from the Roman usurpers and establish Himself as kin g over Israel? How then could he permit Him to stoop to perform this servant's task? <br>
 In reply to Peter's earnest inquiry, Jesus said: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">What I do thou knows not now; but thou shall know hereafter.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John 13: 7. <br>
 This declaration from Jesus revealed the fact that there was in this act a hidden meaning, which did not at once appear to the disciples. They knew Jesus was washing their feet, and yet He said that they did not now know what He was doing. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A Spiritual Cleansing <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Feeling certain that his attitude was correct, Peter rashly declared: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Thou shall never wash my feet.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Jesus answered him: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">If I wash thee not, thou has no part with Me.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John 13: 6-8. <br>
 Did Peter's part with Christ depend upon having the dust removed from his feet? No; but his salvation and hope of eternal life did depend upon the cleansing away of all the defilement of sin by the blood of Christ. This work of cleansing was symbolized by this simple and fitting ordinance. <br>
 The true significance of what Jesus was doing began to dawn upon Peter's sluggish mind, and in astonishment he exclaimed: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Verse 9. To this Jesus answered: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Verse 10. <br>
 In a literal sense, no doubt, Jesus here referred to the fact that they had just come from the full bath, and their bodies were clean except for the dust that had gathered on their feet. With the washing of the feet they would then be clean </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">every whit.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 But in a spiritual sense He clearly referred to the cleansing from sin that was symbolized by this new ordinance. <br>
 Just as they had already bathed, so at conversion they had been baptized. This complete washing in the waters of baptism signified the cleansing of the life from all sins of the past. This was the big washing. It was typical of the fountain that was opened for sin and uncleanness. Through the cleansing signified by baptism, the sins that were as scarlet had become as white as snow. The stains were all removed. The life was clean. The soul was free from guilt. - All things had become new. <br>
 But conversion and baptism had not removed the disciples from sin's environment. They were still surrounded with evil influences. They were still subject to temptation. Although Christ was abundantly able to keep them from falling again into sin, they had not always fully trusted themselves into His keeping, with the result that sin had been committed. Some of these acts were known to be sinful, although others constituted sins of ignorance. <br>
 Following conversion and baptism, sins may accumulate in the life of a follower of Jesus. As he travels the Christian pathway in a world filled ' with sin's foul miasma, the feet become soiled. The past life of sin is not again charged to the Christian unless he entirely repudiates his conversion and turns his back upon Christ. He does not require a complete reconversion and cleansing. But he does require the lesser cleansing. Day by day he must come to God through Christ, confessing his failures, his pride, his selfishness, and his fallings into sin through the temptings of Satan. He must exercise faith that just as all his past sinful life was forgiven and cleansed when he first came to Jesus, so now the blood of Christ cleanses him anew from these additional sins. This lesser cleansing is symbolized by the ordinance of feet washing. <br>
 It was because of this deep spiritual significance that Jesus said: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">If I wash thee not, thou has no part with Me.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">&nbsp; <br>
 This act on the part of Christ was performed not only for the purpose of impressing upon the minds of His disciples the virtue and grace of true humility; it was not only for the purpose of rebuking their pride and self-seeking and their envy of one another; but it was also for the purpose of setting in the church a new ordinance that would be symbolic of the fact that the blood of Christ can keep the Christian clean by its continual application to the life of him whose trust is in Jesus. In this way only would men and women become prepared to sit at the Lord's table. After performing this service Jesus announced to His disciples: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John 13: 15. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Each Man a Priest <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 But why did not Jesus meet the situation by commanding His disciples to each wash his own feet in preparation for the Lord's supper? We answer: Because in such an act there would have been no service typical of the work of Jesus. <br>
 No man can save himself. No individual can cleanse his own soul from sin's guilt. This work must be done for him by another. In carrying out this holy ordinance in the church, each member thus ministering to his brother would become a personal representative of Jesus. As he applied the symbolic cleansing water to his brother's feet, he would proclaim, in that act, once again the old, old story that only through the application of the blood of Christ can the guilt of sin be removed from the soul. Thus, each member of the church upon earth would in turn become a priest to his brethren. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Lord's Supper <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
As soon as this service was performed, Jesus again seated Himself at the Passover table, and there proceeded to institute the additional ordinance that is now commonly called the Lord's supper. The record says: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to His disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body. 'And He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink you all of it; for this is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Matt. 26: 26-28. <br>
Already Jesus was living in the very shadow of death. In a few short hours He would be taken by the mob to be reviled, persecuted, and slain. His body was to be broken by the nails and the spear. His, blood was to be spilled upon the ground. All this was to be endured, not because of any cause for death in Him, but for the remission of the sins of others. It was for them that He was permitting these things to be done to Him By His stripes, they were to find healing. By His death, life was to be made available to them. His death was to be entirely substitutionary. <br>
Jesus desired to place in the church an ordinance that would be symbolic of the very sufferings He must endure on man's behalf. As His followers would meet from time to time and break the unleavened bread and crush it between their teeth, they would have before them a vivid reminder of the agony and woe that Jesus passed through on their behalf on Calvary in order to atone for their sins. The breaking of the bread would symbolize the piercing of His hands, feet, and side, as He suffered death at the hands of His enemies. The drinking of the wine (unfermented grape juice) would symbolize the flowing forth of His blood from His broken body, as it was shed for the remission of sins. Of the institution of this ordinance the Apostle Paul has written: <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread: and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, cat: this is My body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me. After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in My blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of Me. For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till He, come.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> 1 Corinthians 1l: 23-26. <br>
 Just as the offering of the blood of animals, looking forward to Christ's redemptive work on the cross, was to continue until His first advent, so these new ordinances, commemorating His death, were to be in the church until He should come the second time. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">This do you ... in remembrance of Me.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> As His followers gather at the Lord's table and partake of these emblems, they show </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">the Lord's death till He come.&nbsp; Only those who wholly reject the provisions made for their redemption through the glorious work of the atonement can lightly regard these sacred ordinances of Christ's church upon earth. Those whose faith in Him is strong will see in these provisions a means of demonstrating that faith in His power to save by coming often to the fountain for cleansing and purity. They will rejoice over every opportunity of surrounding the Lord's table to meditate upon His eternal love, which led Him to pour out His life for their redemption, and to testify of their full acceptance of the provisions of the atonement by partaking of the emblems of His humiliation and sacrificial death. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An Example <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Jesus made it clear that the ordinances which He instituted on that memorable evening in the Jerusalem upper room were to be accepted as examples, and were to be repeated by the church during the years that would intervene between His ascension and His coming again. <br>
 Concerning the bread and wine He said: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">This do you.... For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till He come.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> 1 Corinthians 11: 25, 26. <br>
 It was left to the church to determine the exact intervals when they would meet and celebrate this ordinance, but the intervals were to be of sufficient frequency to serve as a constant reminder of the Lord's sufferings on behalf of sinners. No particular day of the week was designated upon which these ordinances were to be celebrated. Jesus instituted them on Thursday night at the close of the Passover supper. No doubt, however, the most fitting time for the observance by the church is the Sabbath day, when God's people are accustomed to gather for divine worship. <br>
 	Concerning the ordinance of humiliation and cleansing, Jesus said: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Know you what I have done to you? You call Me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and, Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The. servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John 13: 12-17. <br>

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> God bestows upon all members of His church in every age spiritual gifts which each member is to employ in loving ministry for the common good of the church and of humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who apportions to each member as He wills, the gifts provide all abilities and ministries needed by the church to fulfill its divinely ordained functions. According to the Scriptures, these gifts include such ministries as faith, healing, prophecy, proclamation, teaching, administration, reconciliation, compassion, and self-sacrificing service and charity for the help and encouragement of people. Some members are called of God and endowed by the Spirit for functions recognized by the church in pastoral, evangelistic, apostolic, and teaching ministries particularly needed to equip the members for service, to build up the church to spiritual maturity, and to foster unity of the faith and knowledge of God. When members employ these spiritual gifts as faithful stewards of God's varied grace, the church is protected from the destructive influence of false doctrine, grows with a growth that is from God, and is built up in faith and love. (Romans 12:4-8; 1 Corinthians 12:9-11, 27, 28; Ephesians 4:8, 11-16; 2 Corinthians 5:14-21; Acts 6:1-7; 1 Timothy 2:1-3; 1 Peter 4:10, 11; Colossians 2:19; Matthew 25:31-36.) <br>

They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; Revelation 12:17; 19:10.) <br>

They express God's love, will, and purposes concerning human conduct and relationships and are binding upon all people in every age. These precepts are the basis of God's covenant with His people and the standard in God's judgment. Through the agency of the Holy Spirit they point out sin and awaken a sense of need for a Savior. Salvation is all of grace and not of works, but its fruitage is obedience to the Commandments. This obedience develops Christian character and results in a sense of well-being. It is an evidence of our love for the Lord and our concern for our fellowmen. The obedience of faith demonstrates the power of Christ to transform lives, and therefore strengthens Christian witness. (Exodus 20:1-17; Matthew 5: 17; Deuteronomy 28:1-14; Psalm 19:7-13; John 14:15; Romans 8:1-4; 1 John 5:3; Matthew 22:36-40; Ephesians 2:8.) <br>

WHILE walking down a street in Calcutta, India, some years ago, the writer noticed that many of the people he met had strange marks on their faces and foreheads. Some markings were similar, and others were very different in shape and size. Wondering whether these markings held any significance, a companion, who was a resident of the city, was asked to explain. <br>
 &quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;those marks indicate the particular deity of India of which the respective bearers are devotees. If, for instance, a man is a worshipper of Ganesa, he makes known that fact to the world by bearing the sign of Ganesa on his forehead. If he is an apostle of Siva, then he bears the sign of Siva, which is very different. And so with the other gods. Each god has a special sign, and by displaying the sign, a worshipper announces his special allegiance, to a particular deity.&quot; <br>

 It may be surprising to some to learn that the God of heaven, the great Creator, also has a sign by which He is known to His people and by which they are marked as His followers. This sign is clearly set forth in the Creator's own words: &quot;And hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord your God.&quot; Ezekiel 20:20. <br>
God's Sabbath is the sign between Him and His people. It constitutes the mark of distinction by which men and women show allegiance to the Creator and indicate to the world that He is their God. <br>
When Christ, acting as the Father's agent, had perfected the work of the original creation, pronouncing it &quot;very good,&quot; He did not leave the world without an adequate memorial of that mighty accomplishment. He instituted the weekly Sabbath as a perpetual reminder of the fact that He was the author of all things. The record is: <br>
&quot;And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it: because that in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.&quot; Gen. 2: 1-3, RV. <br>
Two thousand five hundred years later, when Jehovah stood upon Mount Sinai and declared God's eternal law to men, He definitely enjoined upon them the duty of Sabbath observance, stating as the reason the fact that in six days He had made heaven and earth and sea and all that in them is and had rested upon the seventh day. Let us note carefully His solemn words: <br>
&quot;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work. But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shall not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.&quot; Exodus 20: 8-11. <br>
Thus, the weekly Sabbath was given to commemorate creation. It became the sign of the power of the great Creator. It was ever to distinguish Him from the false gods of the nations. <br>
In Ezekiel's prophecy He declares: &quot;I am the Lord your God; walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, and do them; and hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord your God.&quot; Ezekiel 20: 19, 20. <br>

Since, therefore, the Sabbath was given as a sign of God's work in creation, it becomes a sign also of the power of Jesus Christ our Savior. For it was Jesus who created the heavens and the earth. This fact is clearly set forth in the words of the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Colossians: <br>
&quot;Who bath delivered us from the power of darkness, and bath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son: in whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the first born of every creature: for by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him: and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.&quot; Col. 1: 13-17. <br>
In his Epistle to the Hebrews, the Apostle Paul repeats his declaration that Christ is the world's Creator: <br>
&quot;God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He bath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds ... .. But unto the Son He said, Thy throne, 0 God, is forever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Thy kingdom. Thou has loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows. And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of Your hands.&quot; Hebrews 1: 1, 2, 8-10. <br>
The disciple John declares: <br>
&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.&quot; &quot;And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.&quot; John 1: 1-3, 14. <br>
The truth stands out in bold relief: that Jesus of Nazareth, the One who was made flesh and dwelt among us, the One by whose blood we have redemption from sin, is the One who, in the beginning, created all things. He made the heavens and the earth. When God said, &quot;Let us make man in our image&quot; (Gen. 1: 26), He was speaking to His Son; and the Son carried out His Father's desires. He was the Father's active agent. He was the Mediator or Middleman between God and all His works. It was the Son of God who &quot;spoke, and it was done&quot;; who &quot;commanded, and it stood fast.&quot; (Psalm 33: 9.) It was by His word that the heavens were made, &quot;and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.&quot; (Verse 6.) He is the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. &quot;He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Col. 1: 17. <br>
To what conclusion then does this bring us? There can be but one answer. <br>
Since Jesus Christ, God's Son and man's Savior, was this world's Creator, and since the Sabbath was given as a sign of the power of the Creator, the Sabbath is Christ's sign. It was He who gave it to man, that he might have it as a constant reminder that Jesus, who had undertaken man's salvation and sanctification, was the Author of the original creation. It is, therefore, the Christian Sabbath. It was because of this that Jesus could say: &quot;The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.&quot; Mark 2: 28. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Given at Creation <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The Sabbath was given to man at creation. That is when it was made. That is when it was hallowed and sanctified. Upon this holy day, the Creator rested and was refreshed. It was then that He gave it to man as a weekly reminder of His power and work in creation. Let us note the record again: <br>
&quot;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made.&quot; Gen. 2: 1-3. <br>
&quot;God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.&quot; Now to sanctify, says Cruden, means &quot;to separate <br>
and appoint any thing to an holy and religious use.&quot; - Cruden's Complete Concordance, Edition 1769. Therefore, the seventh day was separated from the other days of the week and was appointed by the great Creator as a day to be used and observed by His people upon earth as a holy day. <br>
Upon this important point the following comments from a professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature at the New York City University are worthy of the most careful consideration. <br>
&quot; 'And sanctified it.' Hebrew, kadash. It is by this term that positive appointment of the Sabbath as a day of rest to man is expressed. God's sanctifying the day is equivalent to His commanding men to sanctify it. As at the close of creation the seventh day was thus set apart by the Most High for such purposes, without limitation to age or country, the observance of it is obligatory upon the whole human race, to whom, in the wisdom of Providence, it may be communicated. <br>
&quot;This further appears from the reason why God blessed and sanctified it, viz., 'because that in it He had 'rested,' etc., which is a reason of equal force at all times and equally applying to all the posterity of Adam; and if it formed a just. ground for sanctifying the first day which dawned upon the finished system of the universe, it must be equally so for sanctifying every seventh day to the end of time. <br>
&quot;The observance of the day is moreover enjoined in the Decalogue, which was not abolished with the peculiar polity of the Jews, but remains unalterably binding upon Christians in every age of the world. . . . The sanctification of the seventh day in the present case can only be understood of its being set apart to the special worship and service of God.&quot;- George Bush, Notes, Critical and Practical, on the Book of Genesis (Presbyterian), Vol. 1 (two-volume edition), pages 48, 49, note on Gen. 2: 3. <br>
We add also the testimony of another, as he comments upon that same, scripture: <br>
&quot;By this is meant, 1. The day appointed of God, at the close of creation, to be observed by man as a day of rest from all secular employment, because that in it God Himself had rested from His work. (Gen. 2: 1-3.) Not that God's rest was necessitated by fatigue (Isaiah 40: 28); but He rested, that is, ceased to work, on the seventh day as an example to man; hence assigned it as a reason why men should rest on that day. (Exodus 20: 11; 31: 17.) God's blessing and sanctifying the day, meant that He separated it from a common to a religious use, to be a perpetual memorial or sign that all who thus observed it would show themselves to be the worshippers of that God who made the world in six days and rested on the seventh. (Exodus 20: 8-11; 31: 16, 17; Isaiah 56: 6, 7.) &quot; - Amos Binney and Daniel Steele, Theological Compend, pages 169, 170. <br>
 &quot;As a memorial of that fact [the creation of the world], He set apart the Sabbath, kept it, sanctified and blessed it, for the benefit of all. . . . . Thus the keeping of the Sabbath makes God known. Gives efficacy to His moral government.... It commemorates the work of God as Creator, Preserver, Benefactor, and Redeemer.&quot;- Justin Edwards, The Sabbath Manual, pages 16, 19, 22. And again: <br>
&quot;The Sabbath was appointed at the creation of the world, and sanctified, or set apart for holy purposes, 'for man,' for all men, and therefore for Christians; since there was never any repeal of the original institution. To this we add; that if the moral law be the law of Christians, then is the Sabbath as explicitly enjoined upon them as 'upon the Jews.&quot; -Richard Watson (Methodist), A Biblical and Theological Dictionary, pages 829, 830. <br>
A fourth witness declares: <br>
&quot;As this was the most ancient institution, God calls them to remember it; as if He had said, Do not forget that when I finished My creation, I instituted the Sabbath, and remember why I did so, and for what purposes.&quot; -Dr. Adam, Clarke, A Commentary and Critical Notes, Vol. I, page 387, note on Exodus 20: 8. <br>
We find that the religious leaders are in almost universal agreement upon the fact that the seventhday Sabbath was definitely instituted at creation as a memorial of that great event and was intended for the whole human family. Since it is contained in the moral law, every jot and tittle of which stands for ever, it is as much in force today as when it was first given as a blessing to man. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A Particular Day <br>

It should be carefully noted in passing that the Sabbath was made of a particular day. The commandment declares &quot;the seventh day is the Sabbath.&quot; It is nor one day in seven, not a seventh part of time, but &quot;the seventh day.&quot; The Sabbath is not an institution that may be shifted from one day to another at the will and caprice of man, but it is the seventh day of the week. <br>
It was not an institution that the Lord blessed, but a day. As houses are made out of stone and <br>
wood, so the Sabbath was made out of a particular day-the seventh day, now commonly called Saturday. If, therefore, the seventh day be separated from the Sabbath, the Sabbath is destroyed. This conclusion is foregone and inevitable. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sabbath-breaking Leads to Idolatry <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
It was the failure of the nations to keep the Sabbath and recognize its sanctity that led many of them into idolatry. By disregarding the Sabbath, men have lost the constant, weekly reminder of God's creative power. They have looked upon the visible objects of His creation and have been led by Satan to reverence and even worship the creature rather than the Creator. <br>
&quot;Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the un-corruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonur their own bodies between themselves: who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.&quot; Romans 1: 21-25. <br>
Had the human family always regarded and observed the Sabbath, this lapse into heathen worship would have been impossible. They would have had before them a constant reminder that there is a living God who is Creator and the only true God. He being the Creator is greater than the things created and, therefore, the only object worthy of man's worship and adoration. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Seal of God <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The Sabbath is also referred to in the Scripture as the &quot;seal of the living God.&quot; This is because of the fact that the Sabbath command alone, of all the Decalogue, reveals the name, authority, and realm of the Author of the law. This command reveals the fact that the Lawgiver is &quot;Lord God,&quot; the Maker of the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is. (Exodus 20:10,11.) This is absolute proof that this law did not emanate from any of the gods of the heathen, but is the product of the mind of the Creator. This commandment stamps the entire law with His signature. It seals it as genuine. <br>
This great seal of God is to be impressed on the minds and hearts of Christ's followers and is to constitute a sign of allegiance to His kingdom. Of one of John's visions of the redeemed, he declared:&nbsp; &quot;And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have scaled the servants of our God in their foreheads.&quot; Rev. 7: 1-3. <br>
This seal of God will mark the followers of Christ for heaven. It reveals that He is their Lord and Savior, that they belong to Him, and that they have been saved by His grace. It is His sign that they are His. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sabbath Not a Shadow <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
There are those who reason that the weekly Sabbath was one of the types and shadows in the Mosaic dispensation, and that although the other nine commandments remained in force after the cross, this particular one passed away. This reasoning usually seems to be based upon the following statement of the Apostle Paul, in Col. 2: 1417: <br>
'Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross.... Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.&quot; <br>
But the seventh day weekly Sabbath was not a shadow. As we have learned in former chapters, the <br>
shadows of the Old Testament were ordinances that had to do with the offerings and sacrifices pertaining to the sanctuary services, all of which typified the death of the Son of God upon the cross for the sins of men. It was a way by which God's people might express their faith in a Savior to come, just as through baptism and the sacrament we today express our faith in a Savior who has come. <br>
True, there were some shadowy Sabbaths. In the ceremonial law governing the sacrifices, there were several yearly Sabbaths. Upon these days special sacrifices were offered. Of one of the annual Sabbaths we read: <br>
&quot;And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that journeys among you. For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all Your sins before the Lord. It shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you, and you shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.&quot; Lev. 16: 29-31. <br>
This day of atonement, like all other annual Sabbaths enjoined in the law of Moses, came only once a year. They were, of course, &quot;shadows of good things to come&quot;; because they were days of offering sacrifices that pointed forward to Christ's death. At His death they would naturally cease, just as all the other shadows did. This, then, is what Paul refers to when he says: &quot;Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.&quot; Col. 2: 16, 17. <br>
But the seventh day weekly Sabbath belongs to another code of law entirely. The command enforcing it says nothing about offering sacrifices. It does not point forward. It points backward. It is a memorial. It is not a shadow. The command enjoining its observance is set up to be an eternal reminder of a great event in the past. That event was the creation of the world in six days by the God of heaven. (Exodus 20:11; Gen. 1: 1-3.) It was intended to form a barrier forever against the worship of other gods and against such theories as evolution. <br>
Just as baptism is a memorial of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, so the Sabbath is a memorial of the fact that Jehovah Christ is this world's Maker; that the earth did not come into being by chance, as many religious teachers today believe. It is the handiwork of God. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Sabbath Before Sin <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The sacrificial system was instituted after sin entered, and by pointing forward to the Lamb of God, the true Sin Bearer, it was to serve as a means of avoiding the penalty of sin. The Sabbath, on the contrary, was instituted before sin entered and, therefore, was not created because of sin. The ceremonial law, which included these yearly shadowy Sabbaths, was added because of transgressions,&quot; and only till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.&quot; (Gal. 3: 19.) But the weekly Sabbath was instituted before transgression, and is to remain for all time, even into the new earth, the eternal home of the redeemed. (Isaiah 66: 22, 23.) <br>
&quot;Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily My Sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the Lord that does sanctify you. You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever does any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed. And He gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.&quot; Exodus 31:13-18. <br>
Thus, the Sabbath is a sign of the true God. That is the reason God commanded men to remember it and to keep it holy. That is the reason He placed the Sabbath commandment in the very heart of the moral law, or Decalogue. It was to be of perpetual obligation. It stretches from Paradise before man fell into sin to Paradise regained. It will be His holy, blessed rest day throughout eternity and will be kept by His children in the coming kingdom of glory. <br>
&quot;For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, said the <br>
Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, said the Lord.&quot; Isaiah 66:22,23. <br>

                                                      <strong>Who made the heavenly bodies? </strong><br>
&quot;God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: He made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.&quot; Gen. 1:16-18. <br>
&quot;Thus said God the Lord, He that created the heavens and stretched them out.&quot; Isaiah 42:5. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>What was man's origin? </strong><br>
&quot;So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.&quot; Gen. 1:27. <br>
&quot;I have made the earth, and created man upon it.&quot; Isaiah 45: 12. <br>

                                                      <strong>What great memorial did God give to man of His creative power? </strong><br>
The seventh day Sabbath. &quot;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shall not do any work.... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore [for this reason] the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.&quot; Exodus 20: 8-11. <br>
NOTE - These verses show clearly that the weekly Sabbath was instituted for the purpose of giving men a constant reminder of the fact that God was their Creator and also the Maker of all things. It was meant to protect them from being led away after false gods. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Of what is the Sabbath a sign? </strong><br>
It is a sign of the true God. <br>
&quot;And hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord your God.&quot; Ezekiel 20:20. <br>
NOTE - When people observe the true Sabbath, it serves as a sign that they are worshippers of the Creator, the true and living God. It is also a sign to the world that they are His people. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>When was the Sabbath made? </strong><br>
It was made at the end of creation week, the first week of this earth's history. <br>
&quot;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made.&quot; Gen. 2: 1-3. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Out of what did God make the Sabbath? </strong><br>
Out of a day, the seventh day: &quot;But the seventh day is the Sabbath. . . . Wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.&quot; Exodus 20: 10, 11. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>How did God make the Sabbath? </strong><br>
After spending six days creating the earth and man, He rested on the seventh. Thus, it became God's rest day. After resting, He blessed the seventh day (for all future time), and this day became God's blessed rest day. Then He sanctified it (set it apart for a holy and religious use by them), thus making it God's blessed, sanctified, rest day. (See Gen. 2: 1-3.) <br>
                                                      <br>
What kind of day is the seventh day Sabbath? <br>
It is a holy day. &quot;If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day.&quot; Isaiah 58:13. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Which day of the week is the seventh day? </strong><br>
The day commonly called Saturday. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>For whom was the Sabbath made? </strong><br>
&quot;The Sabbath was made for man.&quot; Mark 2: 27. <br>
NOTE - No distinction is made here of race, color, or nationality. The word man is used here in the generic sense, meaning for the human race as a whole. The Sabbath was made for all men of all ages and races. All who are of God's creation need this weekly reminder of His omnipotence. <br>

It is to be a day of physical rest and worship of God. No ordinary business nor work should be done upon the Sabbath. &quot;In it thou shall not do any work.&quot; Exodus 20: 10. <br>

Throughout all time and eternity. <br>
&quot;For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, said the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, said the Lord.&quot; Isaiah 66: 22, 23. <br>

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
THE plan of salvation is based upon the principle of re-creation. When hearts and lives are marred and spoiled by sin, they cannot be remodeled or improved they must be remade. There must be a new heart and a new life. The old man must die, and a new man take possession of the body. It is said of King Saul that &quot;God turned Saul into another man.&quot; Paul says: &quot;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is [margin, Or, let him be] a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&quot; 2 Corinthians 5:17. Ezekiel declares that there must be &quot;a new heart and a new spirit.&quot; (Ezekiel 18:3 l.) Peter speaks of the new Christians as &quot;newborn babes.&quot; (1 Peter 2:2.) <br>
It takes the same power to restore the image of God in fallen man as it took in the beginning to create man in His image. This is creative power. This is the reason an angel could not become man's Savior. Only the Creator, Jehovah, Could re-create and restore man to his original condition of innocence and purity. This He was ready to undertake. &quot;For God so loved the world, that He, gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John 3: 16. <br>
What confidence in the plan of redemption this f act inspires. He who became Redeemer from sin was the world's Creator. The One who stretched out the heavens, who marshals the stars calling them all by name, who controls the seasons, the day and the night, and by whose power all things consist, offers to take these poor lives and purify and sanctify them. Say not then, &quot;I am such a great sinner that Christ could not save me.&quot; He is an infinitely greater Savior than you are a sinner. His power to save is measured by the vastness of His creation. He is omnipotent to save as He was omnipotent to create. &quot;He is able. . . to save ... to the uttermost.&quot; Hebrews 7: 25. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Sign of Sanctification <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
But what is the sign of Christ's power in the new creation? It is the same as in the original creation. It is the seventh-day weekly Sabbath rest. It not only is the memorial of the literal creation but also the sign or pledge of Christ's power in the spiritual creation. Hear then the words of Jesus, spoken through His prophet, as He definitely claims the Sabbath as a sign that He is fully able to accomplish man's redemption. <br>
'Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.&quot; &quot;And hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord your God.&quot; Ezekiel 20: 12, 20. <br>
How fitting that the Lord should choose the Sabbath as a sign of His power to save! It is the sign which distinguishes Him from every false god and sets Him apart as the only divine sovereign having creative power and the ability to remake the lives of men after they have been wrecked by sin. The Sabbath was intended to be a perpetual, weekly reminder of both the creative and redeeming power of the true God. <br>
Had the people of earth faithfully observed it from creation, the nations never would have drifted away from the worship of the true God. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Jesus Kept the Sabbath <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
When Jesus was upon earth, He recognized the binding obligation of the Sabbath He had given; and He sacredly kept it as an example to man. He honored it as the day for public worship. He met with the people on that day in their houses of worship and taught them the principles of the gospel. &quot;And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.&quot; Luke 4: 16. <br>
It was not simply by chance that Christ, on this particular Sabbath, went to the house of worship; for such was &quot;His custom.&quot; He was a Sabbath-keeper. He made a practice of going to the house of worship on that day. As Jesus later foretold the overthrow of Jerusalem by the Roman armies and warned His people to flee from the doomed city, He added: &quot;But pray you that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.&quot; Matt. 24:20. Some forty years later Jerusalem fell to the Romans. It is evident, therefore, that Jesus recognized the sanctity of the Sabbath, and that -this sanctity would not be lessened after His death, resurrection, and ascension. In fact, no change in the Sabbath was ever recognized either by Christ or by His disciples. They always observed the original seventh day. <br>
                                                      <br>

In speaking to the Pharisees one day, Jesus made the startling declaration: &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.&quot; Mark 2: 27, 28. If, therefore, the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath, the Sabbath must be the &quot;Lord's day.&quot; To this also agree the solemn words of the Lord by Isaiah: <br>
&quot;If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day. And call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable. And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words: then shall thou delight thyself in the Lord. And I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for t</span><br>

The fourth commandment of God's unchangeable law requires the observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one another. It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our eternal future in God's kingdom. The Sabbath is God's perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and His people. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, sunset to sunset is a celebration of God's creative and redemptive acts.

80 Facts About the Sabbath and Sunday&nbsp; <br>

Forty Seven Bible Facts About Saturday <br>
                                                      <br>
After working six days to create this earth, God rested on the seventh day of the week (Saturday): Genesis 2:1, 2. <br>
When God rested upon the seventh day, Saturday became His “rest day.” That is why the Bible calls <br>
Saturday “The Sabbath Day.” The word “Sabbath” means “cessation” or “rest.” <br>
3.	God blessed the seventh day of the week and made it holy: Genesis 2:3; Exodus 20:11. <br>
4.	Just as no one can change your birthday, so Saturday will always be God's Sabbath day. No human can change the day God has blessed and made holy: Numbers 23:19, 20. <br>
5.	God created the Sabbath day before Adam and Eve sinned. Therefore, the Sabbath is not a “type,” or “shadow” since God introduced “types” and “shadows” after sin. <br>
6.	Jesus said that the Sabbath was made for man: Mark 2:27. <br>
7.	Since the Greek word translated “man” means “human beings,” the Sabbath is meant for every person regardless of his nationality. <br>
8.	Jesus said that He is Lord of the Sabbath day: Mark 2:28. Therefore the seventh day is called “The </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><br>
Sabbath Day,” and also “The Lord's Day.</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">” <strong><br>
9.	The Sabbath day is a memorial of cr</strong>eation: Exodus 20:11. Every time we rest from our work on Saturday we are honoring God as our Creator and rejecting </span><br>

We are responsible to Him for their proper use. We acknowledge God's ownership by faithful service to Him and our fellowmen, and by returning tithes and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and the support and growth of His church. Stewardship is a privilege given to us by God for nurture and love and the victory over selfishness and covetousness. The steward rejoices in the blessings that come to others as a result of his faithfulness. (Genesis 1:26-28; 2:15; Haggai 1:3-11; Malachi 3:8-12; Matthew 23:23; 1 Corinthians 9:9-14.) <br>

For the Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we involve ourselves only in those things which will produce Christ like purity, health, and joy in our lives. This means that our amusement and entertainment should meet the highest standards of Christian taste and beauty. While recognizing cultural differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat, befitting those whose true beauty does not consist of outward adornment but in the imperishable ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit. It also means that because our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we are to care for them intelligently. Along with adequate exercise and rest, we are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures. Since alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and the irresponsible use of drugs and narcotics are harmful to our bodies, we are to abstain from them as well. Instead, we are to engage in whatever brings our thoughts and bodies into the discipline of Christ, who desires our wholesomeness, joy, and goodness.

For the Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, and should be entered into only between partners who share a common faith. Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility are the fabric of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, closeness, and permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church. Regarding divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Although some family relationships may fall short of the ideal, marriage partners who fully commit themselves to each other in Christ may achieve loving unity through the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the church. God blesses the family and intends that its members shall assist each other toward complete maturity. Parents are to bring up their children to love and obey the Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them that Christ is a loving disciplinarian, even tender and caring, who wants them to become members of His body, the family of God. Increasing family closeness is one of the earmarks of the final gospel message.

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle which the Lord set up and not man. In it Christ ministers on our behalf, making available to believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice offered once for all on the cross. He was inaugurated as our great High Priest and began His intercessory ministry at the time of His ascension. In 1844, at the end of the prophetic period of 2300 days, He entered the second and last phase of His atoning ministry. It is a work of investigative judgment which is part of the ultimate disposition of all sin, typified by the cleansing of the ancient Hebrew sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. In that typical service the sanctuary was cleansed with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things are purified with the perfect sacrifice of the blood of, Jesus. The investigative judgment reveals to heavenly beings who among the dead are asleep in Christ and therefore, in Him, are deemed worthy to have a part in the first resurrection. It also makes manifest who, among the living are abiding in Christ, keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus and in Him, therefore, are ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. This judgment vindicates the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus. It declares that those who have remained loyal to God shall receive the kingdom. The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of human probation before the Second Advent. (Hebrews 1:3; 8:1-5; 9:11-28; Daniel 7:9-27; 8:13, 14; 9:24-27; Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6; Malachi 3:1; Leviticus 16; Revelation 14:12; 22:12.) <br>

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Now that the law of the earthly priesthood, which limited that service to the tribe of Levi and the house of Aaron, was taken out of the way by being nailed to the cross, the way was open for Christ to enter upon His priestly ministry in heaven. At His ascension He appeared before the Father, who by a solemn oath appointed Jesus to the exalted position of high priest, to officiate in man's behalf in the sanctuary above. Of this experience the Apostle Paul declares: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">For those priests were made without an oath; but this with ail oath by Him that said unto Him, The Lord swore and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 7: 12. That this appointment was made subsequent to Christ's sacrifice on the cross seems to be indicated by Paul, when he says: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 7: 28. The oath which made Christ a priest was since the law. That is, the law which specified that only Levites could serve in the priesthood acted as a bar to Christ's serving in the capacity of priest; but when the ceremonial law was set aside, He who sprang out of Judah,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> could be sworn in, becoming a priest for ever. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Types Found Only in Levitical Service <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 Some have mistakenly looked to the priesthood of Melchisedec for the types of Christ's priestly ministry instead of to the Levitical service. If the types are to be found in Melchisedec's priestly ministry, it is important that we understand them in order that we may also understand the work of Christ in heaven. But no record of the priestly ministry of Melchisedec is to be found in the Scripture, neither is there found a record of the shedding of blood nor the offering of sacrifices by him. No work of atonement is revealed.&nbsp; We do, however, find all the work of a priesthood in type and symbol set forth in the work of the Levitical priests. Here is revealed every detail of the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. Without the types of the Levitical priesthood, we are left entirely without a typical ministration. Looking to the Levitical ministry, however, we have a complete typical service, which teaches every essential principle of 'the plan of redemption. <br>
 Paul, speaking of Christ's priesthood, declares: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">If He were on earth, He should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 8: 4, 5. From this declaration it becomes evident that it is the service of the priests, prescribed by the ceremonial law, that is to be taken as an example of the work of Christ in heaven. These were the Levites. They were designated as priests by the law of Moses. It was their service that was set forth as an </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">example and shadow of heavenly things.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
It is true that in one outstanding respect (that of appointment to the priesthood) Christ was a priest after the order of Melchisedec rather than after the order of Aaron. (Hebrews 7: 21.) Melchisedec could not have served as a priest under the law of Moses, f or he did not become a priest by inheritance. He was </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">without father, without mother, without descent [margin, pedigree].</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 7: 3. His genealogy could not be traced to some particular tribe or family in Israel, and thus prove that he had an inheritance in the priesthood. The sons of Aaron were priests, because their fathers were priests. It was an inheritance. The office was handed down from father to son. But not so with Melchisedec. He was appointed to the priesthood by an oath. <br>
This was also true of Christ. He was of the tribe of Judah and not of Levi. According to the ceremonial law, therefore, Christ had no inheritance in the priesthood. He was without priestly parentage, or pedigree. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">He of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there arises another priest, who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 7: 13-16. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Priesthood Changed <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Like Melchisedec, Jesus was made a priest by special appointment and an oath of God, and not by inheritance. (Hebrews 7: 20.) But since He was not of the tribe of Levi or of the house of Aaron, He could not serve as priest so long as the ceremonial law governing the priesthood remained in force. This made it imperative that the Mosaic law be set aside so as to clear the way for the new priest Christ Jesus to begin His ministry. Thus the Apostle. Paul declares: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 7: 12, 28. <br>
In this respect, therefore, Christ was a priest after the order of Melchisedec. Let it be carefully noted that it was not Christ's priestly service that was likened to that of Melchisedec, but rather the manner of His appointment to the priesthood. The types of Christ's ministration as priest are found only in the Levitical service. It was in the services of Israel's sanctuary that Christ's ministry was prefigured. Of Christ's glorious entry upon His priestly service, the apostle says: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 8: 1, 2. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Hope of Sinners <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Upon the facts of Christ's sacrificial death and subsequent priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary rests the hope of all repentant sinners. There, at God's right hand, He offers His precious blood as an atonement for sin; and there He receives the prayers of His people and, as Mediator, offers them before the Father with sweet incense. Describing this work, John the revelator says: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Another angel [Christ] came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto Him much incense, that He should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Rev. 8:3,4. <br>
It is through His mediation that sinners find their way back to God, and through His daily ministry of His shed blood that they obtain forgiveness for sins and the gift of eternal life. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Taken from Among Men <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Paul states that the priests who ministered upon earth were taken from among men. They were chosen from among those whom they were to serve, in order that they might be compassionate toward the people, and be sympathetic with their human frailties. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 5: 1, 2. <br>
Thus, the priests were taken from among their brethren and not from some strange tribe which had nothing in common with the people whom they were to serve. <br>
This was also true of Christ. He Himself had to become like unto His brethren before He could serve as a priest. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For verily He took not on Him the nature of angels; but He took on Him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it became Him to be made like unto His brethren, that He might be [become, ARV] a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succor them that are tempted.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 2: 14-18. <br>
'We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 4: 15, 16. <br>
If, therefore, it was necessary that in all things Christ should become like His brethren in order that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest, it naturally follows that His priesthood could not begin until after His incarnation and suffering here on the earth. <br>
Note in the above scriptures the apostle declares it was after Christ </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">took on Him the seed of Abraham</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> He became a priest, and this was one of the prerequisites to His priesthood. This 'He took, of course, at the time He was born of Mary. Christ's priestly ministry in the sanctuary above could not begin until the priesthood of Aaron closed, since the antitype does not run parallel to the type, but follows it. The changing of the priesthood from Aaron to Christ prepared the way for Christ to begin His priestly ministry in heaven. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Must Have an Offering <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Also, before Christ could perform priestly ministry, it was necessary that He have some offering to present to God. Said the Apostle Paul: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 8:3. <br>
In the earthly sanctuary service the initial sacrifice was offered by Moses (who in this act represented God), before Aaron was anointed to the priesthood. The priestly service must be performed with shed blood; thus, Christ had first to serve as a sacrifice and shed His blood in behalf of sinners in order that when He as priest should appear before God in man's behalf, He would not appear empty-handed. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Since the Cross <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
We emphasize this point because it shows conclusively that the entire priestly work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary has had to be performed since the cross. It could not have begun before He came to earth. <br>
His priestly service subsequent to the cross is, however, efficacious for those who lived before and for those who have lived after the cross. His death on Calvary was in behalf of all penitents. He died for sinners who lived before the cross, and His ministry as priest is equally efficacious for those who lived after the cross. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Begins in First Apartment <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
In the earthly sanctuary the service was carried on in the first apartment for 3 59 days of the Jewish year, and on one day of the year the work was transferred into the second apartment. Since the service of the earthly priests was an example or a type of the service of Christ, He, too, must serve both in the first and in the second apartments of the heavenly sanctuary; and His service in both these apartments must come after the cross. He must begin His ministry in the first apartment, or </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">holy place,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> then later transfer to the second, or </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">most holy place.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Since the earthly priests ministered in the first apartment of the sanctuary for the entire year except for one day, it follows that when Christ began His ministry as our High Priest in heaven, He would be occupied most of the time from His ascension to His second advent in the first room of the sanctuary in heaven. Accordingly, He will spend only a short time in the second room, or most holy place, just before the end of time. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Within the Veil <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
When Christ entered the heavenly sanctuary to begin His priestly work, Paul tells us that He entered </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">within the veil.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entered into that within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 6: 19, 20. <br>
This statement has been wrongly understood by some to mean that Christ passed immediately into the holy of holies, or second room, of the heavenly sanctuary when He ascended. If there were only one veil in the sanctuary, there might be ground for this deduction, but the truth is that the sanctuary has two veils. In describing the earthly sanctuary Paul, in Hebrews 9: 3, refers to </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">the second veil.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> The fact that there are two veils is also clearly set forth in Exodus 26: 31-36, where we read: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Thou shall make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: <br>
with cherubims shall it be made: and thou shall hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of silver. . . . And thou shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Here, then, is a dividing veil which separated the two rooms of the sanctuary from each other, and another veil, or hanging, forming the entrance door into the first room of the sanctuary. When Paul refers to the first veil, he simply says, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">within the veil</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">; but when he speaks of the dividing veil, he says, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">the second veil.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 It is apparent from the foregoing that when the apostle declared that Christ, our High Priest, had entered </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">within the veil,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> he meant He had entered the first apartment beyond the first, or entrance, veil. He did not indicate He had gone within the second veil. Therefore, this statement of the apostle is in confirmation of the fact that when Christ ascended to heaven, He passed into the first room of the sanctuary within the first veil, or entrance door, there to begin His priestly ministry in this heavenly temple. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>His Work in the Holy Place <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 What was Christ's work in the first room of the heavenly sanctuary? Was there anything for Him to do there? There was. His ministry in the first apartment was to plead the merits of His righteousness and of His shed blood in behalf of sinners on the earth who would accept Him. He had said to the people on the earth: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Isaiah 45:22. It was through the ministry of His blood that He was able to save. <br>
 In 1 John 2: 1 Jesus is said to be our Advocate. In Romans 8:34 Paul states that He </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">makes intercession for us.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John the revelator sees Him in the holy place before the golden altar, offering up incense with the prayers of the saints; and Jesus Himself declared that He would confess before His Father those who confess Him before men. (Matt. 10: 32.) <br>
 This, then, was His work in the first apartment of the sanctuary. As sinners came to God for pardon, and pleaded the shed blood of Jesus in their behalf, Jesus became their Advocate, and made intercession for them before God. He offered up their prayers with sweet incense to the Father, and pleaded that since His blood had been shed in behalf of sinners, and since these had accepted Him as their sacrifice, they might receive pardon. Yes, since He had taken upon Himself the guilt of their sin, He offered to impute to them His life of righteousness. By accepting Jesus as their substitute and sacrifice, the sins of the sinners were transferred from themselves to Him; and from the time He began ministering in the heavenly sanctuary, the sins were accumulating there. <br>
 Thus did Jesus perform a continual service in the holy place until the time came for Him to begin His work in the holy of holies just as in the earthly sanctuary the altar fires were to be kept burning continually, in readiness to consume the sacrifice for sinners who would seek pardon, so Christ has stood ready, day and night, continually, to receive sinners and to offer His shed blood in their behalf. His standing invitation to sinners is: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Matt. 11: 28. He gives them rest by taking away their load of sin, lifting the burden entirely from their shoulders, and ministering pardon and grace to them. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Isaiah 53: 4. <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The intercession of Christ in man's behalf in the sanctuary above is as essential to the plan-of salvation as was His death upon the cross. By His death He began that work which after His resurrection He ascended to complete in - heaven.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;">-E. G.

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
When Christ entered the heavenly sanctuary, He found Himself in the throne room of the Father. Said the Apostle Paul: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Hebrews 8: 1. <br>
For the purposes of the sanctuary service, the throne of God had been established in the first room of the sanctuary in order that Christ's ministry might be before the throne, and that He might occupy it jointly with the Father. This placing of the throne is described by John the revelator in Rev. 4: 2-5, where we read: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Immediately I was in the Spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. And He that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
From the picture given by John it is evident that the throne of God and the additional seats occupied by the four and twenty elders were placed in the sanctuary, and in that part of the sanctuary where the </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">seven lamps of fire</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> were burning. This, of course, was in the first apartment, since these seven lamps of fire must necessarily correspond to the golden candlestick of the earthly sanctuary with its seven lamps. And here it is that John sees Christ beginning the priestly ministry of His shed blood, for he adds: </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Rev. 5: 6. <br>
It may be thought by some that the fact that Christ appeared in the presence of His Father and before the throne to begin His priestly ministry constitutes evidence that He went immediately into the most holy place, or second room of the sanctuary, since it is supposed that God's throne is located there. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What Is the Throne of God? </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <br>
We do not find support in Scripture for the idea held by some that God's throne is stationary, and that it is and always has been situated in the most holy place in the sanctuary. On the contrary, it is very clearly set forth in the Word that the throne of God is movable and that its location is changed from time to time. It does not consist of a great chair that has been built of stone, gold, or wood, but is composed of living creatures who are capable of , moving with the swiftness of lightning. According to Ezekiel 1: 12 -14, 19, 24, 2 5, it is evident that wherever the Majesty of Heaven goes, His living throne goes with Him. In this way He is not limited to one location as a seat of government, but He is king on the throne wherever He may be. <br>
Another description of this living throne is given by John in Rev. 4: 6-9. Here the writer pictures the living creatures who compose and uphold the throne as intelligent beings who cry, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Holy, holy, holy, <br>
Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
From Daniel's prophecy it is evident that the Father's seat was not to be located in the second room, or most holy place, in the heavenly sanctuary until the time of the judgment. Preparation for the work of judgment is described by the prophet, when he says: <br>
'I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: His raiment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool; His throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him: thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Dan. 7: 9, 10, RV. <br>
This indicates that God the Father and Christ the Son moved to a new location when the time came for the opening of the judgment, near the end of time. God's throne had been situated in the first room of the sanctuary from the beginning of Christ's priestly ministry, but now both He and the Father move into the second room, or most holy place. This corresponds exactly to the type set forth in the earthly sanctuary, where the priest ministered in the first room 359 days of each Jewish year, and only one day, at the end of the yearly round of service, in the holy of holies.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
This transfer of Christ's place of ministry from the first apartment to the second in the sanctuary in heaven, and the opening of the judgment, were to take place at the close of the 2300 days of Dan. 8: 14, which period we shall later show has already been reached. <br>
Thus did Christ minister as high priest in the holy place, receiving there the sins of the people who came unto God by Him. And thus, the heavenly sanctuary has become defiled by the sins of men. This defilement required a cleansing at the close of His priestly ministry. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>By His Own Blood <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The most glorious feature of this heavenly ministry of our great High Priest is the fact that He offers, not the blood of animals slain by men's hands as an atonement for sin, but His own precious blood, which was shed upon Calvary. Thus, God's way is in the sanctuary. The blood of the animal sacrifices was typical, and could not take away sin. (Hebrews 10: l.)

WHAT, then, is the true significance of the sanctuary service in heaven? It is this: that through the vicarious sacrifice and priestly ministry of Jesus Christ there is full and complete pardon for all sins and requisite power for lives of holiness and obedience. Said Jesus, speaking through the pen of the prophet: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against Me: . . . and whereby they have sinned against Me.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Jeremiah 33:8 RV. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Psalm 103: 11, 12. And again, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> for </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">if we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> 1 John 1: 7, 9, RV. <br>
0 soul, bowed down with a sense of guilt, look up and behold your full pardon in the bleeding hand of your great High Priest in heaven. Take it today from the hand that still bears the mark of the crucifixion, and go on your way rejoicing. Provision for your full emancipation was provided when Jesus came forth from the tomb. He tasted death for you and for every man; and His blood, when offered before God in the sanctuary in behalf of all, is counted to be a price sufficiently great to atone for every sin. <br>
No merely human savior could have paid such a price and purchased redemption. The demands of the broken law were too exacting. It had been broken by finite beings, and it required an infinite being to repair the breach. The right of divine government must be upheld, and the honor of the divine law must be vindicated. A perfect obedience must be rendered. But man, as man, could never accomplish this. It required a God-man, Jehovah, incarnate in human flesh to do it. And then He did it, He did a perfect work. He did not purchase a half pardon; He did not provide a partial blotting out, but He gave a pardon as full and as broad as the transgression. Yes, and He did even more, for Paul states that </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">where sin increased, grace has overflowed.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Romans 5: 20, Weymouth. <br>
It is hard for sinners to realize that it is possible for God actually to forgive their sins and set them free. Men become accustomed to the feeling that they are lost, and that there is no hope nor possibility of changing their situation. <br>
The following story, told by Dwight L. Moody, illustrates how even in this life men are often incredulous when pardon and liberty are freely offered them: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">I was in Ohio a few years ago,</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> said Mr. Moody, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">and preached in the state prison. Eleven hundred convicts sat in front of me. The chaplain said to me, 'Mr. Moody, I want to tell you of a scene which occurred in this room. A few years ago our commissioners went to the governor of the state and got him to promise that he would pardon five men for good behavior. The governor consented, with the understanding that the record was to be kept secret, and that at the end of six months the five men highest on the roll should receive a pardon, regardless of who or what they were. At the end of six months the prisoners were brought into the chapel. The commissioners came up, and the president stood on the platform. Putting his hand in his pocket he brought out some papers, and said, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">I hold in my hand pardons for five men.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> ' <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">The chaplain told me that he never witnessed anything like it. Every man was as still as death; many were deadly pale and the suspense was awful; it seemed as if every heart had ceased to beat. The commissioner went on to tell them how they had got the pardon. But the chaplain interrupted him. 'Before you make your speech read out, the names.' <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;"> 'Reuben Johnson will come and get his pardon' - and he held it out, but none came forward. He said to the governor, 'Are all the prisoners here?' The governor told him they were all there. Then he said again, 'Reuben Johnson will come and get his pardon. It is signed and sealed by the governor. He is a free man.' Not one moved. The chaplain told me he looked right down where Reuben was. He had been there nineteen years, and men looked around to see him spring to his feet. But he himself was looking around to see the fortunate man who had got his pardon. Finally the chaplain caught his eye and said, 'Reuben, you are the man.' Reuben turned round and looked behind him to see where Reuben was. The chaplain said the second time, 'Reuben, you are the man,' and the second time he looked around thinking it must be some other Reuben. The chaplain had to say it three times, 'Reuben, come and get your pardon.' At last the old man got up and came along down the hall, trembling from head to foot, and when he got the pardon he looked at it and went back to his seat and buried his face in his hand and wept.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
                                                      <br>
It seemed absolutely incredible to Reuben that the pardon was actually meant for him. He had not deserved it. It came as an act of overflowing grace from the governor of the state, who alone had the power and authority to set him free. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A Sufficient Sacrifice <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The justice of God demanded a sacrifice equal to the enormity of man's transgression, and in Jesus this demand was more than fully met. Therefore, the vilest transgressor may come to Him today confessing guilt, and receive pardon for every sin. The law, which before condemned him and demanded death, now pronounces him acquitted; and it can never again bring him into condemnation for past sins unless, perchance, he should willfully renounce his confession and his faith in the atoning blood. </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Romans 8: 1. How soul-stirring and inspiring is the following testimony of the Holy Spirit on this point: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">But God's free gift immeasurably outweighs the transgression.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">If therefore we have now been pronounced free from guilt through His blood, much more shall we be delivered from God's anger through Him.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">It follows then that just as the result of a single transgression is a condemnation which extends to the whole race, so also the result of a single decree of righteousness is a life-giving acquittal which extends to the whole race.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> Romans 5: 15, 9, 18, Weymouth. <br>
Long ago this marvelous truth was beautifully stated by another: <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">He bore the sin, and consequently the penalty of sin. Had we been left, Christian reader, to bear our sins, we must inevitably have borne alone the punishment of our sins. But Jesus took upon Himself our sins. For this, He became a party in the covenant of redemption; for this He assumed our nature; for this, He sorrowed in Gethsemane; for this, the law of God exacted its utmost claim; and for this, the justice of God inflicted the utmost penalty. Oh, what a truth is this! The Son of God offering Himself up a sacrifice for sin! He who knew no sin; who was holy, harmless, and undefiled; not one thought of evil in His heart, yet made sin, or a sin offering! Oh, the bigness of the thought! If God Himself had not declared it, we could not have believed it, though an angel's trump had announced it. God Himself must proclaim it; and because He has so proclaimed it, we believe it. And God alone can write it upon the heart. '0 Thou blessed and adorable Immanuel! and was this the end and design of Thy intense and mysterious sufferings? Was it that Thou should obey, bear the sin, endure the curse, and bow Thy head in death, that I might go free? Was it in my stead, and in my behalf? 0 love unexampled! 0 grace infinite and free! That God should become incarnate: that the Holy One should so take upon Him sin as to be dealt with by stern justice as though He were Himself the sinner: that He should drain the cup, give His back to the smiter, endure the shame and the spitting, and at last be suspended upon the cross, and pour out His last drop of most precious blood-and all this for me-for me a rebel -for me the chief of sinners!' <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Entire Pardon <br>

It is the full pardon of all his sins. It were no pardon to him if it were not an entire pardon. If it were but a partial blotting out of the thick cloud-if it were but a forgiveness of some sins only then the gospel were no glad tidings to his soul. The law of God has brought him in, guilty of an entire violation. The just</span><br>

The Savior's coming will be literal, personal, visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be glorified and taken to heaven, but the unrighteous will die. The almost complete fulfillment of most lines of prophecy, together with the present condition of the world, indicates that Christ's coming is imminent. The time of that event has not been revealed, and we are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times.

During this time the wicked dead will be judged; the earth will be utterly desolate, without living human inhabitants, but occupied by Satan and his angels. At its close Christ with His saints and the Holy City will descend from heaven to earth. The unrighteous dead will then be resurrected, and with Satan and his angels will surround the city; but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the earth. The universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever. (Revelation 20; Zechariah 14:1-4; Malachi 4:1; Jeremiah 4:23-26; 1 Corinthians 6; 2 Peter 2:4; Ezekiel 28:18; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; Revelation 19:17, 18, 21.) <br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Christ's Final Victory Over Sin <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
AT THE coming of Christ, mighty changes will take place upon the earth. Its cities will be destroyed, it will be entirely depopulated, and it will become a place of total darkness. <br>
For an entire millennium, the earth's only inhabitants will be Satan and his angels. It is at Christ's Second Advent that Satan is to be bound and cast into what in Scripture is called &quot;the bottomless pit.&quot; There he is to be held prisoner for a thousand years. <br>
This binding of Satan is graphically described by John in the Revelation, where, in portraying the scenes clustering about the end of time, he exclaims: <br>
&quot;And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in His hand. And He laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot; Rev. 20: 1-3. <br>
Of course, the angel here seen coming down from heaven is Christ, as He comes the second time to earth. Only He has the power to lay hold of and bind Satan. Only He can cast him into the bottomless pit. <br>
The time has come for God to settle accounts with the great adversary. For six thousand years, Satan's nefarious work of deception and destruction has been going on, until the entire earth is corrupt and defiled. Now he must `lick the dust.&quot; (Psalm 72: 9.) &quot;For He [God] will finish the work [margin, the account], and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.&quot; Romans 9: 28. <br>
The sure promise of God to His people is: <br>
&quot;The captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contends with thee, and I will save thy children. And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.&quot; Isaiah 49: 25, 26. <br>
Jesus comes and lays hold on the dragon, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, and binds him with a great chain. This is in direct fulfillment of the promise given in Eden when God declared that the Seed of the woman would eventually bruise or crush the head of the serpent. The time for the death blow has almost come; and in preparation for the final execution, Satan is bound and imprisoned. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Into the Bottomless Pit <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The term &quot;bottomless pit&quot; used here has the same meaning as does deep in Gen. 1:2. There we are told that when the earth was first created, and before it was beautiful and perfected, it &quot;was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.&quot; <br>
 The expression in Revelation 20 refers to this earth when it has once again become a great abyss. At the Second Advent of Jesus, it is reduced to a pile of rubble. The Bible abounds with divine predictions of this impending destruction. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>D-Day <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
 As Jesus prepares to leave for the earth, a great voice proceeding out of the temple and from the throne will announce, &quot;It is done.&quot; (Rev. 16: 17.) This closes human probation and the work of the gospel. D-Day has now arrived. It is time for the great invasion. Christ and His armies are about to go on the march. <br>
Now the softening up process begins. <br>
 &quot;And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.&quot; Rev. 16: 18, 19. <br>
Warns the prophet Isaiah: <br>
 &quot;Howl you; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt: and they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travails: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames. Behold, the day of the Lord comes, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and He shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.&quot; Isaiah 13: 6-9. <br>
 Not only will the cities of the earth fall, but God promises to make the earth empty, to turn in upside down, and to scatter abroad the inhabitants thereof. During the mighty earthquake, the earth is to move exceedingly. (Isaiah 24: 19.) <br>
&quot;The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the, high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited. Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before His ancients gloriously.&quot; Isaiah 24: 20-23. <br>
Here again the pit or abyss where Satan is to become a prisoner is mentioned. It is the world reduced to chaos. Upon the frightful scene, even the sun and moon seem to refuse to shine. They hide in shame, as it were, from the awful tragedy sin has wrought in the earth; and as a result the earth becomes a veritable dungeon. It is of this same terrible experience that Jeremiah also prophesied: <br>
'I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by His fierce anger. For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end. For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.&quot; Jeremiah 4: 23-28. <br>
This is the bottomless pit-the dark, sunless prison into which Satan is to be cast as a prisoner, when Christ arises to shake terribly the earth, and when He prepares for His great invasion into His enemy's kingdom. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Wicked Destroyed <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Not only will the cities of the nations f all, but as the 'heavens burst asunder and reveal the returning Lord, the wicked of earth will find that they are not able to stand before Him. They will instantly perish upon the earth; they will be destroyed by the brightness of His appearing. (2 Thessalonians. 2: 8.) <br>
&quot;Out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.&quot; Rev. 19:15. <br>
Thus, Jeremiah could truly say, 'I beheld, and, lo, there was no man&quot;. for the earth will be entirely depopulated during the long period of Satan's imprisonment in it. The wicked dead will be strewn from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be gathered, neither lamented nor buried, but shall smolder away upon the ground. See Jeremiah 25: 33. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Righteous in Heaven <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
But where are the righteous during this time of awful retribution? They are in heaven. As Jesus appears, they are caught up to meet Him and are evacuated from the earth. They do not belong in the environment of chaos caused by the wickedness of man, to which the world will be reduced at the advent of Christ. Until the time comes for the renovation of the earth to take place, they are to have a long sojourn in heaven. Of them the earth was not worthy, and they are delivered out of it. <br>
No wonder the revelator exclaimed of the righteous: 'Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him' a thousand years.&quot; Rev. 20: 6. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Righteous Judge the Wicked <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
During the thousand years that God's people spend in heaven, they are to reign with Christ. There is serious work to be done in preparation for the final overthrow of sin, which occurs at the close of the millennium. During the investigative judgment (carried on in the heavenly sanctuary before Christ's second coming), only the cases of those whose names were written in the book of life were considered. The unrepentant sinners, who had never accepted the gospel, are still to be finally judged. <br>
This is the work that will occupy the righteous during their heavenly sojourn. &quot;Do you not know,&quot; asked the apostle, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">that the saints shall judge the world?&quot; 1 Corinthians 6: 2. <br>
Even the fallen angels, who are now held </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">In chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment&quot; (2 Peter 2: 4), will be judged by the redeemed. &quot;Know you not that we shall judge angels?&quot; 1 Corinthians 6: 3. The full punishment of these allies of Satan is yet to be determined. How fitting that those who have been tempted and buffeted in the world should now be called upon to join in passing sentence upon these offenders and in determining their punishment. <br>
&quot;Let the saints be joyful in glory,&quot; exclaimed the psalmist, &quot;let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people. To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron to execute upon them the judgment written: this honor have all His saints. Praise you the Lord.&quot; Psalm 149: 5-9. <br>
What a revelation of infinite wisdom is seen in this provision. Since the saved will have a part in passing sentence upon the wicked, since they will have freely and fully searched all the records, all will be absolutely satisfied that every case has been dealt with fairly and justly. The decision reached in each case will be theirs as well as God's. Now God can safely bring about the destruction of the wicked, knowing that in doing so He will have the approbation of all the subjects of His kingdom. &quot;0 the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!&quot; Romans l l: 33. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Bound by a Chain <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The chain that binds Satan while he roams to and fro throughout the devastated earth during the millennium will not be of steel, but is a series of circumstances with which he will be surrounded. The righteous will be in heaven. They will be forever beyond Satan's reach. No longer can he buffet and tempt them. No longer will they suffer persecution at his hands. The prey of the mighty will have been delivered. <br>
All the wicked will be either in their graves or lying dead upon the earth and will be beyond his reach. He will have no one to victimize. He will be isolated, and for one thousand years he and his allied angels will be confined as prisoners amid the revolting scenes produced by their rebellion and iniquity. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Satan to Be Loosed Again <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Satan's work of deception will not be entirely over, however. Said the revelator: &quot;He should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot; Rev. 20:3. <br>
The circumstance that will loose Satan from prison is revealed in verse five of this chapter. &quot;But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.&quot; Only the righteous dead arise at Christ's second coming. These are the blessed and holy. The wicked will all come up later in the second general resurrection, at the end of the thousand years. To this agree the words of Jesus: <br>
&quot;Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.&quot; John 5: 28, 29. <br>
There is, then, a resurrection of life; and there is a resurrection of damnation. These two resurrections are a thousand years apart. They are divided from each other by the millennial reign of Christ with the saints in heaven. <br>
As soon as the wicked dead are raised to life, Satan is loosed out of his prison. Circumstances have been definitely altered as a result of the second resurrection. He again has subjects to work with and prey upon; and he resumes his work at once. &quot;And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number, of whom is as the sand of the sea.&quot; Rev. 20: 8. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The City of God Comes Down <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Just at this point a spectacular move is made in heaven by God. By His omnipotent power, He removes the capital city of the universe from. heaven to earth, where in the future it is to be located. He chooses to change its location when Satan is busy trying to reconstruct his kingdom upon earth. <br>
As John saw all this in vision, he described the scene thus: &quot;And I John saw the holy city, new <br>
Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&quot; Rev. 21: <br>
2. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Wicked Flee <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
As the wicked behold the city of transcendent beauty and glory floating down through the skies, they are seized with consternation, and try to flee from the scene. Speaking as if to the wicked who will witness this startling phenomenon, the prophet Zechariah declares: <br>
&quot;And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains. For the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake-in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.&nbsp; Zechariah 14: 5. <br>
Jesus precedes the heavenly city as it descends to the earth, and instead of remaining suspended in the air as at His second coming, He will come all the way to the earth. <br>
&quot;His feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.&quot; Verse 4. <br>
The Mount of Olives will not be able to hold Jesus up. As His feet touch it, it will divide into two parts. A massive valley will thus be formed, and into this place the Holy City of God will settle. Thereafter the universe will be governed from this center, &quot;and the Lord shall be king of all the earth.... but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.&quot; Zechariah 14: 9-11. <br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
After the first fright has passed, Satan begins marshalling the nations of earth for a siege of the City of God. He is still the great deceiver, and now he succeeds in leading the resurrected wicked to believe that the New Jerusalem can be taken by force. They have stubbornly refused an inheritance therein, through the merits of Christ's atonement; but now, realizing what they have lost they determine to gain admission and Control by siege and battle. <br>
Inside the city are the righteous, who have now returned to the earth from their long vacation in heaven. (See Zechariah 14: 5 and 1 Thessalonians. 3: 13.) Christ is about to give them the earth as an everlasting inheritance. <br>
&quot;And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.&quot; Dan. 7:27. <br>
Thus, the promise that the meek will inherit the earth is about to be realized. Now they are to enter into their rightful possession. But Satan will not yield his control of the earth without a mighty struggle. He failed in the rebellion in heaven, he failed again at the cross, but now he is determined to make a final stand against God. Let us note again the words of John, as he describes Satan's actions at the close of the thousand years: <br>
&quot;And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and&nbsp; compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city.&quot; Rev. 20: 7-9. <br>
 Wonder of wonders! The City of God is under siege. What an array of soldiers is there! Many of the great generals of past ages lead the armies, which are made up from those who lived in their respective eras. Untold millions of men trained in battle encompass the great city. Surely such a force cannot be overcome. How can it be possible for one city, even God's City, to hold out against a world? <br>
The great engines of war have been wheeled into position. The roar of mighty bombers, like a mighty cyclone, fills the air. The terrible atom bomb, the secret of which was discovered just before Jesus' Second Advent, is ready for its frightful work of destruction. No detail has been overlooked. He who is &quot;wiser than Daniel'' is ordering the battle, and he is determined that this time he shall be gloriously victorious. The siege is laid. The dogs of war, ready for the mighty onslaught, are pulling the leash. The command for attack has been given, and now the mightiest army ever marshaled upon earth, confident of early victory, begins to move toward the pearly gates and the jasper walls. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>City Walls Transparent <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
As the mighty war machine draws near the city, a startling discovery is made. The jasper walls with which Jerusalem is surrounded are seen to be transparent; and from this forward position, those outside can witness the life going on within. Soon, to their utter astonishment, they begin to recognize familiar forms and faces among those who are moving about the streets of the City of God. Some see mothers or wives who are among the saved. Women on the outside may see their husbands. All the righteous of all ages are within. All the wicked are without. <br>
As a result of this experience, the courage of the armies fails. The morale of the soldiers is absolutely destroyed. Their hearts fail within them as they now see and partially realize what they have lost. Like Esau they have sold their heavenly birthright for a mess of pottage a life of pleasure and sin. Instead of an attack, a mighty wail arises from their lips as they acknowledge that they are lost. <br>
&quot;There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.&quot; Luke 13: 28. &quot;The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.&quot; 8: 20. <br>
This will be the last meeting of families of earth. Never again will the righteous and the wicked look upon one another's face. Between them, at this time, &quot;is a great gulf fixed.&quot; (See Luke 16: 19-3 l.) No one can go in or out of the city. Probation has closed. God's nation is made up, and no further mercy will be shown the sinner. God is even now about to pour upon them the vials of His wrath and destroy them forever from the face of the earth. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>All Must Confess Christ <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
But before the devil and his followers are put to death, they will, with unanimous voice, confess that God is true. This will be done within the hearing of those in the City of God and the inhabitants of the entire universe. They acknowledge that God is righteous, that they through rebellion and transgression have no claim upon immortality and the joys of heaven, and that God is justified, therefore, in destroying them for ever from the face of the earth. <br>
Instead of the noise of battle, there now is heard the wailing of the lost; and soon every knee in the vast throng is bent in adoration and acknowledgment of King Jesus, the only rightful Ruler of the earth. <br>
&quot;Wherefore God also bath highly exalted Him [Jesus], and given Him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of, God the Father.&quot; Phill. 2: 9-11. <br>
&quot;For it is written, As I live, said the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.&quot; Romans 14: 11, 12. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Hour of Execution <br>

Thus, God's justice is vindicated. The entire universe, witnessing the scene, has heard the testimony of the unsaved. They have confirmed their own guilt; they have pronounced judgment upon themselves. Never will God's right to destroy them be brought into question. <br>
The hour of execution has come at last. God, who is longsuffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, finds it absolutely necessary to rid the earth of sinners. To permit them to continue to live would bring only continued misery to them and certainly no glory to God. His divine mercy, which is as fathomless as the sea, has at last reached its utmost limit. The foul curse must be removed from the earth, and His universe must be cleansed of rebellion and sin. <br>
There is nothing more God can do for the unsaved. He has poured out His life's blood for them, but they have spurned His love. They have &quot;trodden under foot the Son of God&quot; (by denying Him), have counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and have done despite to the spirit of grace. Now there is &quot;no more sacrifice for sins.&quot; Christ will not die for them a second time. Nothing is left now but &quot;a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.&quot; See Hebrews 10: 26-31. At this time apply the words of the prophet: <br>
&quot;The Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, He shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that He may do His work, His strange work; and bring to pass His act, His strange act.... For I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.&quot; Isaiah 28: 21, 22. <br>
Yes, the destruction of men and women will be a strange act for a God of love. But He has no other course. They have brought the wages of sin upon themselves. They have chosen to walk in the ways of death. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Fire from Heaven <br>

Reverting again to the pen picture of these scenes, as drawn by the revelator, we are brought face to face with the final overthrow of the wicked as Satan's army marches forward. <br>
&quot;And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone.&quot; &quot;And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.&quot; Rev. 20: 9, 10, 14, 15. <br>
This is the end of the wicked. Hell-fire, kindled here upon the earth, will devour them. They shall burn as stubble. As the fat of lambs shall they consume away. They shall be reduced to ashes upon the earth. <br>
&quot;And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.&quot; Zechariah 14: 12. <br>
&quot;Your hand shall find out all Your enemies: Thy right hand shall find out those that hate Thee. Thou shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Their fruit shall Thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. For they intended evil against Thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.&quot; Psalm 21: 8-11. <br>
The saved, inside the jasper walls, witness the final punishment of the lost. Said the psalmist, &quot;When the wicked are cut off, thou shall see it.&quot; Psalm 37: 34. And again: &quot;A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with your eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.&quot; Psalm 91: 7, 8. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Devil Destroyed <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Not only will the fire of God bring about the utter destruction of wicked men, but also of Satan and of his angels. Isaiah, after taunting Lucifer regarding his self -exaltation and fall from heaven, concludes with the warning, &quot;Yet thou shall be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.&quot; See Isaiah 14: 12-15. Ezekiel also foretells the end of the rebel leader in the solemn declaration: <br>
&quot;Thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic. Therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shall be a terror, and never shall thou be any more.&quot; Ezekiel 28:18,19. Though thou be sought for, yet shall thou never be found again.&quot; Ezekiel 26:21. <br>
Jesus made it clear as He dealt with the question of Satan's destiny that the fires of hell have been prepared especially for the devil and his angels and that his destruction would be utter and complete. (See Matt. 25:41.) Contrary to a popular opinion, Satan is not the superintendent of hell, but instead he will he its chief sufferer. Since he is the great instigator of all sin, his punishment will be comparable to the degree of his guilt. He will be the very last to perish in the flames. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Eternal Fire <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
True, the fire with which the wicked will be destroyed is called &quot;eternal fire.&quot; They are to go away into eternal punishment&quot;; that is, it will be eternal in its effects. The punishment to be meted out to sinners is death, eternal death-not an eternal life in hell, but eternal destruction by the fire of hell, a destruction so complete that the sinner can never be brought back to life again. They will be as though they had never been. <br>
The fact that the Bible speaks of everlasting punishment for the wicked has caused many to draw the conclusion that the wicked would continue to suffer in hell eternally. These have grossly misunderstood the teachings of Scripture. One text thus interpreted is Matt. 25: 46: &quot;And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.&quot; <br>
This verse teaches &quot;everlasting punishment,&quot; but it does not mean eternal torment in hell. On the contrary, it means that those who suffer the second death will be everlastingly dead. &quot;The wages of sin is death,&quot; and the second death is everlasting. From it there is no resurrection. They shall never live again. Thus, their punishment death - is eternal. <br>
There is a vast difference between everlasting punishment and everlasting punishing. There will be no everlasting punishing. God is neither a tyrant nor a fiend. He has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, and surely He would have no desire to continue torturing them forever. He must destroy them, in order to put down sin and rebellion and make the universe a safe and decent place for His people to inhabit. The sinner's destruction will be like that of stubble fully dry.&quot; They will consume as the fat of lambs; into smoke shall they consume away.&quot; (See Psalm 37: 20.) And that shall be their end. <br>
Here the curtain drops upon an era of rebellion and sin. Christ the Deliverer has shown Himself mighty to save. His archenemy is no more. The results of the curse have been destroyed. Fire has melted and purified the earth. Once more the universe is clean. Once more perfect harmony is restored. Now Jesus is Lord of all. <br>
&quot;And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders. And the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto Him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.&quot; Rev. 5: 11-13. <br>
                                                      <br>
Enthroned on a cloud, the judge will come.&nbsp; <br>
Bright flames prepare His way; Thunder and darkness, fire and storm,&nbsp; Lead on the dreadful day. <br>
No more shall bold blasphemers say,&nbsp; <br>
&quot;Judgment will never begin&quot;; No more abuse His long delay By carelessness and sin. <br>
                                                      <br>
Then shall the Lord a refuge prove For all His poor oppressed, To save the people of His love, And give the weary rest. <br>

&quot;And the cities of the nations fell.&quot; Rev. 16: 19. <br>
'I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by His fierce anger. For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.&quot; Jeremiah 4: 26, 27. <br>

&quot;Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.&quot; 'I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.&quot; Jeremiah 4: 20, 23. <br>
                                                      <br>
After the righteous are taken to heaven by Christ at His coming, how many persons will be left living on the earth? <br>
'I beheld, and, lo, there was no man.&quot; Jeremiah 4: 25. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>What has happened to the wicked? </strong><br>
&quot;And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming.&quot; 2 Thessalonians. 2: 8. <br>
&quot;And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.&quot; Jeremiah 25: 33. <br>
NOTE - The wicked will be utterly overwhelmed by the awful splendor of His coming and will all fall dead to the ground. (See 2 Thessalonians. 2: 8.) Unnumbered millions of dead of all nations will be scattered over the earth. There will be no one to lament them or bury them. Wherever they fall, they must remain until the second resurrection. <br>

For here God Himself will dwell with His people, and suffering and death will have passed away. The great controversy will be ended, and sin will be no more. All things, animate and inanimate, will declare that God is love; and He shall reign forever. Amen. (2 Peter 3:13; Genesis 17:1-8; Isaiah 35; 65:17-25; Matthew 5:5; Revelation 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15). <br>

                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Paradise Restored <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
THE rebellion is ended. Christ Jesus is gloriously victorious. The fires of hell have done their purifying work. Satan, sin, and sinners are gone; they have utterly perished from the face of the earth. Gone also are all the works of man. Every defiling and hurtful thing has been destroyed in the flames. The results of sin are past. <br>
Now that all this is fully accomplished, the destroying, purifying fire will go out for want of material to burn; and the smoke of the great conflagration will clear away. Thus, Isaiah indicates that when the fire burns up the wicked as stubble, and has completed in work of destruction and cleansing, it shall become so completely extinct that thereafter - there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.&quot; The fire will die out. See Isaiah 47:14. <br>
The destruction of Satan and all his followers will finally open the way for the complete establishment of Christ's kingdom upon the earth and the restoration of man to his Paradise home. <br>
It was God's original purpose that righteous men should dwell on the earth, and this purpose, though temporarily halted by the intrusion of sin, finally will be carried out. <br>
&quot;The righteous shall be recompensed in the earth.&quot; Prov. I 1: 3 1. This earth is man's inheritance. The promise to Abraham that he and his seed should be heirs of the world was not an idle promise. It is as certain of fulfillment as that God lives, for &quot;He is not slack&quot; concerning His promises. Not one of them will fail. &quot;For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. &quot; Romans 4: 13. <br>
After describing the purification of the earth by the fires of hell, the Apostle Peter exclaims in ecstasy, &quot;Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth.&quot; 2 Peter 3: 1013. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A New Earth <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The lake of fire, therefore, is not to destroy the earth but only to melt and renovate it. When the smoke has lifted and only ashes remain, the Lord will once more exercise His creative power by making it new again. This, too, is God's promise., for &quot;He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.&quot; Rev. 21:5. <br>
This arrangement is as old as the plan of redemption. When God set in motion the program for saving man, it included not only his person but also his home. The Bible abounds with God's promises of a renewed earth in which His people shall dwell. Thus, He declared through Isaiah the prophet: <br>
&quot;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.&quot; Isaiah 65:17-19. <br>
To this agree the words of Jesus spoken on the mount of blessing, when He said, </span><span style="color:#000000;">“</span><span style="color:#000000;">Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.&quot; Matt. 5: 5. <br>
John the beloved tells us that in heavenly vision he saw the home of man in its restored state. &quot;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.&quot; Rev. 21:1. <br>
To the new earth, the glory of Eden will be fully restored. The earth will be as it was before the blight of the curse fell upon it. What a fitting place this will be for an eternal abode for God's people! <br>
And this is exactly what is in store for them. As soon as everything is fully restored, Christ will present the entire earth to His people, who have returned with the Holy City. The promise is: <br>
&quot;But unto you that fear My name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings; and you shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, said the Lord of hosts.&quot; Mal. 4: 2, 3. <br>
Yes, they will go forth from the City of God and will once more possess the earth. For &quot;the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.&quot; Dan. 7: 18. In graphic language the prophet Isaiah describes the new earth as it is restored to man and as it was shown him in vision. <br>
&quot;The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and, the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.&quot; <br>
&quot;Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a deer, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.&quot; &quot;No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there. But the redeemed shall walk there: and the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&quot; Isaiah 35:1,2,57,9,10. <br>
This is man's long-lost home. All that was lost by him in the fall will be restored to him again in the new earth. There is to be' a &quot;restitution of all things.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> (Acts 3: 2 l.) The first dominion is to be restored to man through Christ (Micah 4: 8); and-thank God! - This restoration will include the return of the Garden of Eden to the earth. Once again man will walk by the side of the river of life and drink of its sparkling, life-giving waters. Once again will he have free access to the tree of life, from which he has so long been exiled. Yes, Eden, the garden of God, the first home of man, will once more shed forth upon the earth the fragrance of its bloom and verdure. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The New Jerusalem <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
The New Jerusalem will become the eternal capital. This wonder city, with its towering walls of jasper, its twelve gates, each of one solid pearl; with its streets of transparent gold; with its &quot;many mansions?' prepared for the saints by Jesus and the angels, will be already resting upon the earth. It will have safely out ridden the awful conflagration which destroyed the devil and sinners, and from within its walls, King Jesus will govern the nations. <br>
John attempts a description of this mighty metropolis as he saw it descending out of heaven from God. He pictures it as &quot;having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.&quot; Rev. 2 1: 11. <br>
 &quot;And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.&quot; Verse 3. <br>
 This city is of sufficient size to furnish a home for all the saved. John declares the measure of it to be &quot;twelve thousand furlongs&quot; and that &quot;the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.&quot; (Verse 16.) Whether this measure is of one side only or of the entire circumference of the city is not clear. In the one case, it would be 375 miles square; in the other, it would be. 1,500 miles on each side. Many times larger than any metropolis we have seen upon earth before, it will become the very center, not of the earth only, but also of the entire universe, for God will dwell there. <br>
 &quot;And I saw no temple therein,&quot; John declared &quot;for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.&quot; Verses 22-25. <br>
 Thus, the earth, the battlefield. of the forces of good and evil, which for nearly six thousand years has been in the hands of the rebel leader, will not only be restored to God's kingdom but will be exalted above any of the millions of worlds and planets in God's vast creation. The City of God, as a memorial, will be located on the very spot where Jesus was put to death by His enemies. At that time Satan thought the victory was his. He had succeeded in placing the lifeless form of the Son of God in the tomb and had sealed it with the Roman seal. <br>
But He who came forth from the tomb, a conqueror over the devil and death, will establish His eternal throne on Mount Zion as an everlasting memorial of His complete triumph over all His enemies. <br>
&quot;The Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and His name one.... And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.&quot; Zechariah 14: 4-11. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Country Homes <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
But the saints are not to dwell only in the city. They are also to establish homes in the country. The entire earth will be theirs; for &quot;the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High.&quot; Dan. 7:27. As Adam and his posterity were bidden to go forth from Eden and replenish and subdue the earth, so the redeemed will go forth from Jerusalem to inhabit all sections of the new world. They are not to spend their time in idleness. They will be real people, living in a real earth; and their time is to be employed in useful labor. <br>
Adam was told in Eden that he was to dress the garden and keep it. (Gen. 2:15.) So will it he with the redeemed. Concerning this the Lord has spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying: <br>
&quot;They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of My people, and Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.&quot; Isaiah 65:21-23. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Peace <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Think of it! The saved will have eternity in which to build and beautify a home and develop a country estate! No invading armies will march in to pillage and destroy. No thieves will break through and steal. No one will molest or make afraid, for God will plant His people, and they will move no more. The soil, which was cursed for Adam's sake, will yield its strength once more. No chilling frosts nor summer heat will destroy the fruit of the ground. The climate will be perfect. No destructive insects will attack the crops, for all these pests will have been destroyed. No pestilence will come, no storm will sweep over the land, no floods will inundate the crops; for the forces of nature, thrown out of joint as a result of sin, will have been adjusted again, and everything will work to man's interest and not against him as now. <br>
The species of animals we have known this life will be seen in the new earth also, but none will be ravenous or cruel; they will have lost their ferocious natures. <br>
&quot;The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; Isaiah 11: 6-9. <br>
Sweet birds of this Paradise will carol their songs of praise to their Creator; rich verdure will cover hill and valley; majestic trees, which dwarf the giant sequoias, will wave their proud branches in the breeze; and the entire earth will be a place of glory and beauty. <br>
There will be no hospitals there, for the inhabitants of that land will never say, 'I am sick.&quot; (See Isaiah 33: 24.) There will be no graveyards, no crepe on the doorknob; no black-plumed hearse will ever go creaking down the streets of glory. The bloom of eternal youth will be upon every brow. The defects of the former life having been left in the grave, everyone will be physically perfect. <br>
That will be a country of riches without want, health without sickness, pleasure without pain, joy without sorrow, laughter without tears, and life without death. <br>
'God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And He that sat upon the throne said, . . . I make all things new.... Write: for these words are true and faithful.&quot; Rev. 21:4,5. <br>
But who can picture the glory of that land? Who can estimate the value of eternal life. Not in man's fondest dreams can he conceive it. &quot;Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.&quot; 1 Corinthians 2: 9. Higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's love for His children, and this love will be made manifest in the reward that He waits to lavish upon them in the future life. Only then will we enter fully into the &quot;more abundant life&quot; that Jesus declared He had come to give. <br>
The Bible opens with Eden lost, with the curse resting heavily upon man, who has been cut off from God and is under the sentence of death. It closes with Eden restored, with man fully reinstated in his lost home and enjoying the honor and blessing of immortality and eternal life. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Cross Stands Between <br>
                                                      </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> <br>
Do you ask the question, &quot;What makes the difference,&quot; Our answer is: &quot;The cross of Christ.&quot; It cost the life of the Son of God to bring sinful man again to his lost home. Christ is &quot;the way&quot; back to God and Paradise. Only through Him can man regain his forfeited &quot;right to the tree of life&quot; that he may cat and live forever. &quot;This is life eternal, that they might know Thee -the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou has sent.</span><span style="color:#000000;">”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> John 17: 3. <br>
Will you come to Him today and be saved? He waits to welcome you to His heart and home. He longs to take from you the filthy garments of sin and clothe you with the white robe of His righteousness. He will wash you in His blood and make, your life as white as the driven snow. Even now His voice is calling you oh, so earnestly-saying, &quot;My son, give Me your heart.&quot; He longs to have you with Him throughout eternity. <br>
It was for you that He suffered, bled, and died on Calvary. <br>
Some time ago a man was travelling in the great Sahara, and had run out of water. He was famishing with thirst and was upon the verge of utter despair. As he attempted to struggle on a little further in the apparently vain hope of relief, he suddenly noticed by the side of the path a sign which said: &quot;Ten paces to the East, O Traveler, you will find the treasure of Paradise.&quot; <br>
Quickly he took the ten steps, dug into the loose sand, and found clear water. His life was spared. <br>
Just so the treasure of eternal life and heaven is near us, perhaps less than ten paces away. God is not very far from any one of us. In the light of eternity's joys, there is so little to give up. Will you just now take the few necessary steps to enable you to drink of the water of life freely? Christ beckons you to come. <br>
For you He is even now preparing a crown of glory and a home in the City of God. Hear Him as He pleads, &quot;Why Will you die?&quot; It is to you He is speaking. Will you say to Him, &quot;Nay&quot;? Will you harden your heart against His great love? Will you say, &quot;I am ashamed to own Him&quot;? Oh, how can it be! How can we despise God's matchless love! How can we, by refusing to come to Christ, crucify Him afresh and put Him to open shame! How can we neglect His great salvation! <br>
&quot;To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.&quot; Rev. 2: 7. <br>

'For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.&quot; 2 Peter 2: 19. <br>
&quot;And the devil, taking Him up into an high mountain, showed unto Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

We all entered the clou</strong>d together, and were seven days ascending to the sea of glass, when Jesus brought the crowns and with His own right hand placed them on our heads. He gave us harps of gold and palms of victory. Here on the sea of glass the 144,000 stood in a perfect square. Some of them had very bright crowns, others not so bright. Some crowns appeared heavy with stars, while others had but few. All were perfectly satisfied with their crowns. And they were all clothed with a glorious white mantle from their shoulders to their feet. {Early Writings&nbsp; - 60} <br>

Heavenly Knowledge Will</strong> Be Progressive. --All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God's redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless flight to worlds afar--worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With unutterable delight the children of earth enter into the joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge and understanding gained through the ages upon ages in contemplation of God's handiwork. With undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory of creation-- suns and stars and systems, all in their appointed order circling the throne of Deity. Upon all things, from the least to the greatest, the Creator's name is written, and in all are the riches of His power displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
And the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still more glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is progressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The more men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration of His character.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Social Life. There we shall know even as also we are known. There the loves and sympathies that God has planted in the soul will find truest and sweetest exercise.

Sinless Perfection <br>
P</strong>erf<strong>ection exists in th</strong>e least as well as in the greatest of the works of God. The hand that hung the worlds in space is the hand that fashions the flowers of the field. Examine under the microscope the smallest and commonest of wayside blossoms, and note in all its parts the exquisite beauty and completeness. So in the humblest lot true excellence may be found; the commonest tasks, wrought with loving faithfulness, are beautiful in God's sight. Conscientious attention to the little things will make us workers together with Him, and win for us His commendation who sees and knows all.&nbsp; {Education - 114} <br>
The s<strong>cience of redempti</strong>on is the science of all sciences; the science that is the study of the angels and of all the intelligence's of the unfallen worlds; the science that engages the attention of our Lord and Savior; the science that enters into the purpose brooded in the mind of the Infinite--”kept in silence through</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">times eternal” (Romans 16:25, R.V.); </span><span style="color:#000000;">t</span><span style="color:#000000;">he science that will be the study of God's redeemed throughout endless ages.

One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space.

Jim once asked an atheist if he had ever wrestled, even for a few moments, with the thought that maybe God does exist.<br>
“Absolutely!” the atheist said, to Jim’s surprise. “Years ago when our first child was born I almost became a believer in God. As I looked down at that miniature-but-perfect little human being in the crib, as I watched the flexing of those tiny fingers and saw the dawning of recognition in those little eyes, I went through a period of several months during which I almost ceased to be an atheist. Looking at that child almost convinced me there had to be a God.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The design of the human body demands the existence of a designer. Scientists tell us that the brain stores and remembers thousands of mental images, integrates and solves problems, appreciates beauty, comprehends self, and desires to develop the best in each person. Electrical charges originating from the brain control all the muscular activity of our bodies.<br>
Computers also function through electrical impulses. But it took a human mind to invent the computer and a human being to build the computer and tell it what to do.<br>
No wonder the psalmist concluded that the human body speaks loud and clear of a wonderful Creator:<br>
“I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.”-Psalms 139:14. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
We don’t have to go far to find the “works” of God. The intricate design of the human brain and the other organs of our body are the “works” of God, and point to an infinitely skillful designer.<br>
No pump built by man can compare with the human heart. No computer network can equal our nervous system. No television system is as efficient as the human voice, ear, and eye. No central air conditioning and heating system can match the work done by our nose, lungs, and skin. The complexity of the human body suggests that someone designed it, and that Someone is God.<br>
The human body is a complete system of organs-all are interrelated, all thoroughly designed. The lungs and heart, nerves and muscles, all perform incredibly complicated tasks that depend on other incredibly complicated tasks.<br>
If you were to mark ten coins from one to ten, put them in your pocket, shake them around, and then pull them out and put them back in your pocket one by one, what is the likelihood you could do so in exact numerical sequence? By mathematical law you have only one chance in ten billion of taking them out in order from one to ten.<br>
Now consider the chances of a stomach, brain, heart, liver, arteries, veins, kidneys, ears, eyes, and teeth all developing together and beginning to function at the same moment in time.<br>
What is the most reasonable explanation for the design of the human body?<br>
“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,’… SO GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE… male and female he created them.”-Genesis 1:26, 27.<br>
The first man and woman could not just have happened. The Bible affirms that God designed us in His image. He thought us up and brought us into being.<br>

But evidence for God is not confined to the design of our bodies; it’s also spread across the heavens. Leave the lights of the city, and look up into the night sky. That milky cloud beyond the stars that we call the Milky Way is really a galaxy of billions of blazing suns similar to our sun. In fact, our sun and its planets are a part of the Milky Way. And our Milky Way is but one of an estimated more than one hundred billion galaxies that can be seen through giant telescopes on earth and through the Hubble telescope in space.<br>
No wonder the psalmist concluded that the stars speak of a glorious Maker:<br>
“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.”-Psalms 19:1-3.<br>
What may we reasonably conclude by looking at the intricate design and vast size of the universe?<br>
“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” - Genesis 1:1<br>
“[God] is before all things, and in him all things hold together.” - Colossians 1:17.<br>
All creation testifies about God the Master Designer and Infinite Creator. In the simple words, “in the beginning God”, we find the answer to the mystery of life. There is a God who created everything.<br>
Many great scientific minds today believe in God. Dr. Arthur Compton, Nobel Prize-winning physicist, commenting on this verse of Scripture, once said:<br>
“For myself, faith begins with a realization that a supreme intelligence brought the universe into being and created man. It is not difficult for me to have this faith, for it is plain that where there is a plan there is a divine intelligence. An orderly, unfolding universe testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered- ‘In the beginning God.’”<br>
The Bible does not attempt to prove God-it declares His existence. Dr. Arthur Conklin, a noted biologist, once wrote: “The probability of life originating from an accident is comparable to the probability of an unabridged dictionary resulting from an explosion in a print shop.”<br>
We know that human beings can’t make something from nothing. We may build things, invent things, put things together, but we have never brought into being from scratch even the tiniest frog or the simplest flower. The things about us cry out that God designed, God created, God sustains. The only believable answer to the origin of the universe, this world, and human beings-is God.<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The God who designed the starry heavens, who created the universe, seeks a personal relationship with us. He had a personal relationship with Moses: “The Lord would speak to Moses…as a man speaks with his friends” (Exodus 33:11). And God wants to enter into a personal relationship with you and become your friend. Jesus promised those who follow Him: “You are my friends” (John 15:14)<br>
We have all wrestled with the idea of God, for humans are naturally religious. No animal ever builds an altar for worship. Yet everywhere you find men and women, you find them worshiping. Deep within every human heart is a natural desire to worship, an awareness of God, a desire to become a friend of God. When we respond to our longing and find God, there is no longer a doubt about His existence and our need.<br>
During the 1990s millions of atheists in Russia renounced atheism and turned to God. A university professor in St. Petersburg made a statement that typifies the comments made by many transformed atheists in the former Soviet Union:<br>
“I have searched for a meaning to life in my scientific research, but found nothing to have confidence in. The scientists around me have the same empty feeling. As I looked at the vastness of the universe in my study of astronomy, and the emptiness of my soul, I felt there must be some meaning. Then, when I received the Bible you gave me and began reading it, the vacuum in my life was filled. I have found the Bible to be the only source of confidence to my soul. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior and have found true peace and satisfaction in life.”<br>
A Christian believes in God because he or she has met Him and discovers that He satisfies the heart’s deepest needs. The God whom Christians have joyfully found to exist, gives us a new perspective, new meaning, new motives, and new joys.<br>
God doesn’t promise a life free from trouble and conflict, but He does assure us that He will guide and sustain us if we come into a personal relationship with Him. And millions of Christians will testify that they would give up everything rather than go back to a life without God.<br>
This is the greatest wonder of all-that the Almighty God who designed, created, and sustains the universe also desires a personal relationship with every man and woman, boy and girl. David marveled at this, when he wrote:<br>
“When I consider heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of Him?”-Psalms 8:3, 4.<br>
Our Creator is “mindful” of each one of us. He takes a personal interest in you as if you were the only one being He had created.<br>
So we can believe in God: (1) Because of the intricate design in everything He created about us. (2) Because of the longing for God within us that leaves us restless till we find our rest in Him. And, (3) Because when we seek and find Him, God satisfies our every need and longing-to the full!<br>

It is only reasonable that a personal God would want to reveal Himself to His created beings just as a father desires that his children know him. And in the Bible God tells us who He is and what He is like.<br>
What pattern did God use for creating men and women?<br>
“So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him.” - Genesis 1:27.<br>
Since we are made in God’s image, our abilities to reflect and feel, to remember and hope, to ponder and analyze-all are derived from Him. <br>
What is God’s dominant trait?<br>
“God is love.” - 1 John 4:8.<br>
God relates to human beings out of His own heart of love. There is nothing He has done or ever will do which is not motivated by a selfless, sacrificial love.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
In the Bible God repeatedly speaks of Himself as a father.<br>
“Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us? - Malachi 2:10.<br>
Some of the father images we see today are anything but desirable. There are neglectful dads, abusive dads. God is not like that. He is a caring, sensitive Father. He is the kind of Dad who loves to play games with his son or daughter, the kind of Dad who charms his kids by telling wonderful bedtime stories.<br>
Our loving Father wanted to do more than reveal Himself through the words of Scripture. He knew that a person we live with is much more real to us than someone we only hear about or read about in a book. So He came to our world as a real person-the person of Jesus.<br>
“[Jesus] is the image of the invisible God.”-Colossians 1:15.<br>
So if you have seen Jesus, you have seen God. He came down on our Level-He became like us-so He could teach us how to live and be happy, and so we could see what God is really like. Jesus is God made visible. He Himself said, “Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father” (John 14:9).<br>
As you read the story of Jesus in the four Gospels, the first four books of the New Testament, you will discover a fascinating portrait of our heavenly Father. Rough Fishermen dropped their nets to follow Christ, and small children flocked to receive His blessings. He could comfort the most devastated sinner and disarm the most self-righteous hypocrite. He healed everything from blindness to leprosy. In all His actions Jesus demonstrated that God is love! He met human need in a way no one had ever done before Him-or has since!<br>
Jesus’ final glorious revelation of what God is like happened at the cross.<br>
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”-John 3:16.<br>
Jesus died not only to give us a happier life now, but also to give us eternal life. For long ages people wondered, and hoped, and dreamed about God. They saw His handiwork in the sky and in the beauties of nature. Then at the cross, Jesus broke the silence of the ages, and people found themselves looking into the very face of God, seeing Him as He really is-love, eternal and immortal love!<br>
You can discover God right now as Jesus reveals Him. That discovery will lead you to make a very personal affirmation: “Father, I love you!”<br>

The famous mutineers who sank the British ship Bounty ended up settling with their native women on the lonely island of Pitcairn in the South Pacific. The group consisted of nine British sailors, six Tahitian men, ten Tahitian women, and a girl of fifteen. One of the sailors discovered how to distill alcohol, and soon drunkenness corrupted the island colony. Fighting among the men and women grew into violent exchanges.<br>
After a while only one of the original men who reached the island survived. But this man, Alexander Smith, discovered a Bible in one of the chests taken from the ship. He began to read it and to teach the others what is said. As he did so his own life changed, and finally the lives of all on the island.<br>
The islanders were completely isolated from the outside world until the arrival of the United States ship Topaz in 1808. Its crew found the island a thriving, prosperous community with no whisky, no jail, no crime. The Bible had changed the island from a hell on earth to an example of what God wants the world to be. And so it remains today.<br>
Does God still speak to people through the pages of the Bible? He certainly does. As I write this, I’m looking at the answer sheet sent to us by a student of one of our Bible courses. A note at a bottom states, “I am in prison, on death row, sentenced to die for a crime. Before I took this Bible courses, I was lost, but now I have something to look forward to, and I have found a new love.”<br>
The Bible possesses a power that can actually transform people’s lives. When people really begin to study the Bible, lives are dramatically changed.<br>

After creating Adam and Eve, the first man and woman on earth, God spoke to them face-to-face. But when God came to visit them after they sinned, what did the couple do?<br>
“The man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and THEY HID FROM THE LORD GOD among the trees of the garden.”-Genesis 3:8 (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Sin interrupted face-to-face contact with God.<br>
After sin came to our world, how did God communicate with people? <br>
“Surely the sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.”-Amos 3:7.<br>
God has not left us in the dark about life and its meaning. Through His prophets-persons God called to speak and write for Him-He has revealed His answers to life’s great questions.<br>

The prophets gave God’s messages by voice and pen while they lived, and when they died, their writings lived after them. These prophetic messages were then gathered together, under God’s leading, in the book we call the Bible.<br>
But how reliable are their writings?<br>
“You must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation. For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”-2 Peter 1:20, 21.<br>
The writers of the Bible wrote not according to their own will or desire, but only as they were moved, or inspired by the Spirit of God. The Bible is God’s own Book!<br>
In the Bible God tells us about Himself and reveals His purposes for the human race. It shows God’s view of the past, and also opens up the future, telling us how the problem of evil will finally be resolved and how peace will come to our world.<br>
Is all the Bible a message from God?<br>
“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”-2 Timothy 3:16, 17.<br>
The Holy Bible affects human beings so profoundly because “all” the Bible is “God-breathed,” an inspired document, God’s Book. The prophets related what they saw and heard in human language, but their message came directly from God. So if you want to know what life is all about, read the Holy Scriptures. Reading the Bible will transform your life. The more you prayerfully read it, the more peace of mind you’ll experience.<br>
The same Holy Spirit who inspired the prophets to write the Bible, will make the Bible’s teachings, its gospel, effective in transforming your life if you invite the Spirit to be present as you read the Bible.<br>

The Bible is actually a library of 66 books. The 39 books of the Old Testament were composed from about 1450 B.C. to about 400 B.C., the 27 books of the New Testament between A.D. 50 and A.D. 100.<br>
The prophet Moses began the first five books of the Bible sometime before 1400 B.C. The apostle John penned the last book of the Bible, Revelation, about A.D. 95. During the 1,500 years between the writing of the first and last books of the Bible, at least 38 other inspired writers made their contributions. Some were businessmen, others shepherds, fishermen, soldiers, physicians, preachers, kings-human beings from all walks of life. They often lived within contrasting cultures and philosophies.<br>
But here is the wonder of it all: When the 66 books of the Bible with their 1,189 chapters made up of 31,173 verses are brought together, we find perfect unity and harmony in the message they convey. <br>
Suppose a man should knock at your door and, when invited in, place an oddly shaped piece of marble on your living room floor, then leave without a word. Other visitors follow in succession until about 40 individuals have each deposited their numbered marble piece into place.<br>
When the last one has gone, you see with surprise that a beautiful statue stands before you. Then you learn that most of the “sculptures” had never met each other, coming, as they did, from South America, China, Russia, Africa, and other parts of the world. What would you have to conclude? That someone had planned the statue and had sent to each man accurate specifications for his particular piece of marble.<br>
The Bible as a whole communicates one coherent message-just like a perfect marble statue. One mind planned it all, the mind of God. Scripture’s remarkable unity gives evidence that though human beings wrote down the thoughts, they were inspired by God.<br>

(1) The preservation of the Bible is remarkable. All of the early manuscripts of the Bible were copied by hand-long before there were printing presses. Scribes made copies of the original manuscripts and distributed them. Thousands of copies of such manuscripts or portions of them still survive.<br>
Hebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament that go back 150 to 200 years before Christ were found near the Dead Sea in 1947. It’s amazing that these two-thousand year-old scrolls contain exactly the same truth as we find in the Old Testament of Bibles printed today. This is powerful evidence of how reliable God’s Word is.<br>
                                                      <br>
The apostles first wrote much of the New Testament as letters they sent to Christian churches established after the death and resurrection of Christ. More than 4,500 manuscripts of all or a part of the New Testament are on display in the great museums and libraries of Europe and America. Some of them date back to the second century. By comparing these early manuscripts with today’s Bible, we can readily see that the New Testament has also remained essentially unchanged since it was first written.<br>
Today the Bible or portions of it have been translated into over 2,060 languages and dialects. It is world’s best-seller: over 150 million Bibles and Bible portions are sold each year.<br>
(2) The historical accuracy of the Bible is remarkable. Many archaeological discoveries have dramatically confirmed the accuracy of the Bible. Historians have discovered clay tablets and stone monuments which have brought to light names, places, and events previously known only from the Bible.<br>
For example, according to Genesis 11:31, Abraham and his family “set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to [the land of] Canaan.” Because only the Bible spoke of Ur, certain scholars stated that no such city had ever existed. Then archaeologists uncovered a temple tower in southern Iraq with a cylinder at the base written in cuneiform that contained the name Ur. Later finds revealed Ur as the thriving metropolis of a highly developed civilization. That city’s identity had been forgotten, only the Bible preserved its name-until the spade of the archaeologist confirmed its authenticity. And Ur is only one of many examples of archaeology confirming the accuracy of the Bible.<br>
(3) The accurate fulfillment of Bible predictions shows that you can trust the Bible. Scripture contains many remarkable predictions of future events now being fulfilled before our eyes. We examine some of these exciting prophecies in future lessons.<br>

As you explore God’s Word, keep these principles in mind:<br>
(1) Study the Bible with a prayerful heart. If you approach Scripture with a heart and mind opened through prayer, it becomes a personal contact with Jesus (John 16:13-14).<br>
(2) Read the Bible daily. Daily Bible study is a key to power in our lives, an encounter with the mind of God (Romans 1:16).<br>
(3) As you read it, let the Bible speak for itself. Ask: what did the Bible writer intend to say? By grasping what a text means we can apply it intelligently to our life today.<br>
(4) Study the Bible by subject. Compare scripture with scripture. Jesus used this method to prove that He was the Messiah:<br>
“And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in ALL the Scriptures concerning himself.”-Luke 24:27.<br>
By putting together all that the Bible has to say on a certain subject we gain a balanced perspective.<br>
(5) Study the Bible to receive power to live for Christ. The Word of God is described in Hebrew 4:12 as a sharp, double-edged sword. It’s more than words on a page, it’s a living weapon in our hands to fight off temptations to sin.<br>
(6) Listen as God speaks to you through His Word. If a person is to know the Bible truth about a certain subject, he or she must be willing to follow what it teaches (John 7:17), not what some person thinks, or what some church teaching asserts.<br>

“The unforgiving of [God’s] words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.”-Psalms 119:130<br>
Studying the Bible will strengthen your “understanding” give you the strength to overcome destructive habits, and enable you to develop physically, mentally, morally, and spiritually.<br>
The Bible speaks to the heart. It deals with the experiences of humanity- birth, love, marriage, parenthood, and death. It heals the deepest wound in human nature, sin and the misery resulting from it.<br>
God’s Word is not a book of one race, one age, one nation, or one culture. Although written in the East, it also appeals to men and women in the West. It enters the homes of the humble and the mansions of the wealthy. Children love its exciting stories. Its heroes inspire young people. The sick, the lonely, and the aged discover in it comfort and hope for a better life. <br>
Because God works through the Bible, it has great power. It breaks even hearts hardened against all human emotion, softening and filling them with love. We have seen the Bible change a former bandit and opium smoker into a zealous preacher. We have seen the Bible turn a liar and a cheat into an honest and upright teacher. And we have seen this Book snatch people from the brink of suicide and give them a hopeful new beginning. The Bible awakens love among enemies. It makes the proud humble and the selfish generous. The Bible strengthens us in weakness, cheers us in despondency, comforts us in sorrow, guides us in uncertainty, and soothes us when weary. It shows us how to love courageously and how to die without fear. <br>
God’s Book, the Bible, can change your life! You’ll see that more and more clearly as you continue studying the DISCOVER guides.<br>
Why was the Bible written for us? Jesus answers:<br>
“But these [Bible truth] are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that by believing you may have life in his name.”-John 20:31<br>
The greatest reason we should become acquainted with the Holy Scriptures is that it is full of pictures that reveal Jesus Christ and assure us of eternal life. By looking at Christ throughout the Bible, we are changed and become more like Him. So why not begin now to discover the power of God’s Word that can make you more like Jesus?<br>

Some mornings, the world seems a paradise. You wake up, take a deep breath by the window, and look out on golden sunshine reflecting on the trees, leaf by leaf. Some moments make life seem so precious: the face of a beloved friend as you say good-bye, a sublime piece of music that perfectly matches your mood, the unexpected affection of a small child.<br>
But other mornings, the world seems a place of horror. You wake up to newspaper headlines screaming about yet another terrorist bombing that maimed or blinded a child, yet another serial killer claiming his tenth victim, yet another famine or flood or war or earthquake. These are moments when nothing makes sense, nothing seems fair.<br>
What does it all mean? Can we make sense of our wonderful and terrible world? Why are we here? Does my life really matter to God or am I just a minor cog in some vast cosmic machine?<br>

“In six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it Holy.”-Exodus 20:11<br>
The eternal, all-powerful Creator could have formed the world in a moment “by the breath of His mouth.” But God chose to take six days to do it-six minutes, or even six seconds would have been sufficient. The first chapter in the Bible, Genesis 1, describes what God created on each day of the creation week.<br>
What crowning masterpiece did God create on the sixth day?<br>
“GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE, in the image of God he created him; MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM.”-Genesis 1:27.<br>
God decided to create individuals like Himself who could reason and feel and love. Every person is made in God’s “image.”<br>
By the sixth day, the world was filled with plants and animals, and then God introduced His masterpiece of creation. According to Genesis 2:7, the Almighty formed Adam’s body from the dust of the ground. So when God breathed “the breath of life” into his nostrils, man became “a living being”-that is, he came to life. God named the first man created in His image, Adam, a word that simply means “man,” and the first woman, Eve, which means “living” (2:20; 3:20). A loving Creator saw the need for human companionship.<br>
Fresh from the hand of God, Adam and Eve both reflected His image. God could have programmed beings like robots to wander contentedly about the Garden of Eden and raise their voices in adoration to Him. But God wanted more: real relationships. Robots can smile, speak, even do the dishes, but they can’t love.<br>
God created us in His image, with the capacity to think and choose, and to remember, understand, and love. Adam and Eve were God’s children, and inexpressibly dear to Him.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Adam and Eve had everything to make them happy. They enjoyed perfect physical and mental health, living in a beautiful garden home in a flawless world (Genesis 2:8; 1:28-31). God promised them children and the ability to do creative thinking, and to find satisfaction in the work of their hands (Genesis 1:28; 2:15). They experienced face-to-face fellowship with their Maker. No trace of worry, fear, or sickness marred their blissful days.<br>
How did the world change so drastically into a place of suffering and tragedy? The second and third chapters of Genesis tell the entire story of how sin entered our world. Read them at your leisure. Here is a brief summary of their contents.<br>
Some time after God established a perfect world, the Devil came to the Garden of Eden to tempt Adam and Eve into disobeying their Creator. God limited the Devil’s sphere of influence to one tree in the garden, the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” And He warned the first human couple to stay clear of this tree and never to eat its fruit, or they would die.<br>
But one day Eve wandered over by the forbidden tree. The Devil quickly launched into his sales pitch. He claimed God had lied to her and that if she ate the tree’s fruit she wouldn’t die, but would become wise like God Himself, knowing good and evil. Tragically Eve, and then Adam, who had only known good, allowed the Devil to con them, and they sampled the forbidden fruit-thus breaking their bond of trust and obedience with God.<br>
God planned for Adam and Eve to “rule” over our world as the stewards of God’s created works (Genesis 1:26). But because they broke faith with God and chose the Devil as their new leader, the couple lost their jurisdiction. Today the Devil claims the world as his and tries his best to enslave its people.<br>
There are many times when we find ourselves doing something selfish or even cruel when we really want to do the opposite. Why? Because the invisible enemy, the Devil, works to make people fail morally.<br>
As you read chapter 3 of Genesis, you will discover that sin caused Adam and Eve to hide from God in fear. Sin affected all of creation. Thorns appeared along with the flowers. The soil suffered from drought, and labor became a burden. Disease began to strike at random. Jealousy, animosity, and greed multiplied human miseries. Most terrible of all, with sin came death!<br>

“He was A MURDERER FROM THE BEGINNING,… there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is liar and THE FATHER OF LIES.”-John 8:44.<br>
According to Jesus, the Devil is the originator of sin in the universe, the “father” of sin and thus of murder and lying.<br>
Thomas Carlyle, the great English philosopher, once took Ralph Waldo Emerson through some of the worst streets of London’s East End. As they walked along, silently observing the wretchedness and evil around them, Carlyle finally asked, “Do you believe in the Devil now?”<br>

No! A good God would not create a devil. And yet the Bible states that the Devil, along with the angels he had deceived, lost their place in heaven and came to our world.<br>
“And there was WAR IN HEAVEN. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and THE DRAGON AND HIS ANGELS FOUGHT BACK. But he was not strong enough, and they LOST THEIR PLACE IN HEAVEN. The great dragon was hurled down-that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.”-Revelation 12:7-9.<br>
How did the Devil get into heaven in the first place?<br>
“You were anointed as a Guardian CHERUB, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God;…YOU WERE BLAMELESS IN YOUR WAYS from the day YOU WERE CREATED till WICKEDNESS WAS FOUND IN YOU.”- Ezekiel 28:14, 15.<br>
God did not create the Devil, He created Lucifer a perfect angel, one of heaven’s leading angels, standing next to God’s throne. But then he sinned-“wickedness was found in” him. Expelled from heaven, and posing as Adam and Eve’s friend, he became humanity’s deadliest enemy.<br>

“How YOU HAVE FALLEN FROM HEAVEN, O morning star, son of the dawn! YOU HAVE BEEN CAST DOWN TO THE EARTH…. YOU SAID IN YOUR HEART, ‘I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God;… I WILL MAKE MYSELF LIKE THE MOST HIGH.’ “-Isaiah 14:12-14.<br>
The being who became the Devil was originally called Lucifer, meaning “day star” or “shining one.” In this angel’s heart, vanity and ambition began to take the place of devotion. The seed of pride grew into an obsession to take God’s place.<br>
Lucifer must have worked hard to persuade other heavenly beings. It’s easy to imagine Satan arguing that God was holding something back from them, and that the divine law was too restrictive, and that God was an uncaring sovereign. He slandered the One whose character defines what love is.<br>
How was this conflict in heaven resolved?<br>
“Your heart became proud,… So I threw you to the earth.”-Ezekiel 28:17<br>
Pride changed the chief of angels into the Devil or Satan. And in order to preserve the peace and harmony of heaven, he and one third of heaven’s angels who joined him in rebellion, had to be expelled (Revelation 12:4, 7-9).<br>

Why didn’t God create beings incapable of sinning? If He had, there would be no problem of evil in our world. But God wanted people who could have meaningful relationships. So “God created man in His own image” (Genesis 1:27). This means we are free and responsible. We can decide to love God or turn our backs on Him.<br>
God gave the angels and human beings of every generation, a spiritual nature and a capacity to make real choices.<br>
“Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.”-Joshua 24:15.<br>
God challenges the beings He created in His image to choose to do right because their reasoning powers tell them “God’s way is best.” And to turn from wrong because their reasoning powers warn against the results of disobedience and sin.<br>
Only beings with the power to reason and choose can experience real love. God longed to create individuals who could comprehend and appreciate His character, freely respond to Him in love, and be filled with love for others. God wanted to share His love so much that He was willing to take the enormous risk of creating angels and people with the power of choice. He knew it was possible that someday one of His created beings might choose not to serve Him. The Devil was the first being in the universe to make that terrible choice. The tragedy of sin began with him (John 8:44, 1 John 3:8).<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Why didn’t God destroy Lucifer before his sin-disease could spread? Lucifer had challenged the fairness of God’s government. He had told lies about God. If God had destroyed Lucifer immediately, the angels would have begun to serve Him from fear rather than from love. This would have defeated the purpose God had in creating beings with the power of choice in the first place.<br>
How did anyone really know God’s way was best? God gave Satan a chance to demonstrate his alternative system. That’s why he was given an opportunity to tempt Adam and Eve. <br>
This planet has become a testing ground where the character of Satan and the nature of his kingdom are contrasted with the character of God and the nature of His kingdom. Who is right? Who can we ultimately trust? So deceptive was Lucifer, that it has taken time for the beings of the universe to be fully convinced of how disastrous Satan’s alternative actually is. But eventually everyone will see that “the wages of sin is death” and that “the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23)<br>
Every being in the universe will then agree that:<br>
“Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the ages… All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.”-Revelation 15:3, 4.<br>
After everyone understands the deadly nature of sin and the destructive nature of Satan’s philosophy, God can destroy Satan and sin. He will also have to destroy those who stubbornly resist His grace and cling to Satan’s alternative.<br>
God is just as anxious to resolve the problem of sin and suffering as we are to have Him do so. But He is waiting until He can do it on a permanent basis, and until He can both preserve our free will and prevent evil from ever appearing again.<br>
God has promised to destroy sin forever by purifying the heavens and this earth with fire. “In keeping with his promise” we can look “forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of the righteous” (2 Peter 3:10, 13). Sin will never again infect the universe. Sin’s tragic results will stand out so clearly that disobedience to God will seem repugnant for all eternity.<br>
Who makes possible the final destruction of the Devil and sin?<br>
“Since the children have flesh and blood, he [Christ] too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death-that is, the devil- and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.” Hebrews 2:14, 15.<br>
At the cross the angels and the unfallen worlds saw Satan for what he was-a deceiver, a liar, a murderer. There he revealed his true character by compelling men to murder the innocent Son of God. The inhabitants of the entire universe saw how senseless and cruel sin really is. The cross fully unmasked Satan’s motives, and when God destroys the Devil and those who persist in sin, all will acknowledge that God is just.<br>
Jesus’ death on the cross exposed Satan’s real intent before all created beings (John 12:31, 32). The cross also revealed Christ for what He is-the Savior of the world. At Golgotha the power of love stood out in stark contrast against the love of power. The cross established beyond any question that it is self-sacrificing love that motivates God in all His dealings with Satan, sin, and sinful men and women.<br>
At the cross Christ’s eloquent demonstration of God’s unconditional love decisively defeated the Devil. The battle had been over who should rule the world, Christ or Satan. And the cross settled it for all time. It must be Christ above all!<br>
Have you discovered a relationship with the Savior who died to reveal His matchless, unchanging love? How do you feel about the One who came to our world as a human being and died in your place to save you from the results of sin? Will you bow your head just now and thank Jesus, and then ask Him to come in and take possession of your life?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
After a minister had spoken on the subject, “Why I Believe in Jesus,” a well-dressed young man paid him a visit in his study and remarked, “Your talk tonight was interesting, but everything you said about Christ came out of your Bible. Tell me, if Jesus ever lived on this earth, why doesn’t history tell about Him?”<br>
“That’s a fair question,” the minister answered as he turned and took down several books. “But as a matter of fact, history does tell Jesus Christ.”<br>
“That I’d like to see for myself,” the young man responded.<br>
“Well here is Letter 97 of Book 10 of Letter of Pliny the Younger, Roman proconsul in Bithynia, a province of old Asia Minor. Pliny wrote to the Roman Emperor, Trajan, telling him about events in his province. See, here he is asking counsel on how he should handle a new sect, the Christians. He tells of their rapid growth and of how they sang hymns composed to their leader, Christ. Pliny sent his letter about A.D.110. The letter by Pliny offers historical evidence of the man, Christ, and of the spread of His faith in the days of His apostles.”<br>
Surprised, the young man said, “Tell me more!”<br>
As the minister thumbed through another book, he added, “Another historian, contemporary with Pliny, was Tacitus. In his Annals (Book 15, chapter 44) he tells of Nero’s hatred for, and persecution of, the Christians at the time of the burning of Rome. Tacitus explains that the term ‘Christian’ comes from the name ‘Christ’. He mentions that Jesus Christ, the founder of the Christian religion, had been put to death by Pontius Pilate, Procurator of Judea, during the reign of Emperor Tiberius. All these details that Tacitus gives us match exactly the events, names, and places given in the Bible.”<br>
“Pastor, I never knew things like that were in secular history!” the visitor exclaimed.<br>
The minister added, “I want you to notice that about A.D.180 Celsus wrote a book attacking Christian, indicating that Christianity by that time had become a force to reckon with. <br>
“If you are still in doubt, remember that the four Gospels are just as much history as these secular books.”<br>
When this young man realized that both sacred and secular history agree that Jesus did live as a man on earth, he went away convinced that Jesus Christ was a real, historical figure.<br>

Jesus was not merely a good man, He was also God. What claim did Jesus Himself make concerning His divinity?<br>
“If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him…. Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.”-John 14:7-9. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
If you wish to know the answer to the questions, “Who is God? What is He like?” just look at Jesus, who declared,<br>
“I and the Father are one.” –John 10:30.<br>
God the Father and Jesus the Son have existed together from eternity (Hebrew 1:8). There never was a time when Jesus was not one with the Father. The Father shares the same love and care for each person that Jesus demonstrated during His human life on earth. <br>

Since Christ’s life story is a fulfillment of prophecy, His life story was written before He was born. Old Testament prophecies present a clear outline of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection in advance. The New Testament is His life story told in fulfillment.<br>
Living from five hundred to fifteen hundred years before Christ’s birth, the Old Testament prophets made scores of very specific predictions about the life of the Messiah. And at the very beginning of Christ’s earthly ministry, as people compared His life with Old Testament prophecies, what did they conclude?<br>
“We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote-Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”-John 1:45.<br>
Our Savior appealed to fulfilled prophecies to establish His identity:<br>
“And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the [Old Testament] Scriptures concerning himself.”-Luke 24:25-27.<br>
Fulfilled prophecies give convincing evidence that Jesus is the promised Messiah.<br>

Let’s look at a few of these prophetic passages from the Old Testament- and their fulfillment in the New Testament record.<br>
HIS PLACE OF BIRTH<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“But you, BETHLEHEM Ephrathah,… out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.”-Micah 5:2, NKJV.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“Jesus was born in BETHLEHEM in Judea.”-Matthew 2:1.<br>
HIS VIRGIN BIRTH<br>
The Old Testament prophecy:<br>
“The VIRGIN will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel [God with us].”-Isaiah 7:14.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because WHAT IS CONCEIVED IN HER IS FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus [the LORD saves].”-Matthew 1:20-23.<br>
HIS LINEAGE FROM THE TRIBE OF JUDAH<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“THE SCEPTER WILL NOT DEPART FROM JUDAH,… until he comes to whom it belongs.” Genesis 49:10.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“For it is clear that OUR LORD DESCENDED FROM JUDAH.”-Hebrews 7:14.<br>
HIS REJECTION<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
He was despised and REJECTED by men.”-Isaiah 53:3<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“He came to that which was his own, but HIS OWN DID NOT RECEIVE HIM.” <br>
-John 1:11.<br>
HIS BETRAYAL AND THE FEE PAID HIS TRAITOR<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“Even MY CLOSE FRIEND, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.”-Psalm 41:9.<br>
“I told them, ‘If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, kept it.’ So they paid me THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER.”-Zechariah 11:12.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“Then one of the Twelve-the one called Judas Iscariot-went to the chief priests and asked, ‘What are you willing to give me if I handed him over to you? ‘So they counted out for him THIRTY PIEECES OF SILVER COINS.”-Matthew 26:14, 15.<br>
HIS DEATH ON A CROSS<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“They have PIERCED MY HANDS and my feet.”-Psalm 22:16.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“When they came to the place called the Skull, there THEY CRUCIFIED him.”-Luke 23:33. (See also John 20:25.)<br>
HIS ESCAPE FROM THE TOMB<br>
The Old Testament Prophecy:<br>
“Because YOU WILL NOT ABANDON ME TO THE GRAVE, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.”-Psalm 16:10.<br>
The New Testament Fulfillment:<br>
“Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that HE WAS NOT ABANDONED TO THE GRAVE, nor did his body see decay. God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact.”-Act 2:31, 32. <br>
The evidence is strong that Jesus didn’t just happen to fit a few predictions. His biography was indeed written beforehand by supernatural means. Truly, Jesus is the Son of God.<br>
After looking at the evidence, we need to make a prayerful decision about who is going to be Lord in our lives. If you have not already done so, will you place your life in Jesus’ hands?<br>

It’s possible, of course, to assume you are living a God-directed life when you are merely following your own inclinations and impulses (Proverbs 16:25). Our feelings must harmonize with Bible teaching. It’s not safe to conclude that God is leading us unless all three of the guides harmonize.<br>
Take Jake, for example. He has a lovely wife and two children, but had an affair with another woman. He told his friends: “I’ve prayed about it and I feel it’s God’s will.”<br>
Sources for the above historical material and a more detailed history appear in the following books: Documents of the Christian Church, selected and edited by Henry Bettenson (London, Oxford University Press); Joseph Cullen Ayer, A Source Book for Ancient Church History (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1931, 1941); Origen: Contra Celsum, translated by Henry Chadwick (Cambridge: University Press, 1996); F. F. Bruce, The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? 5th edition, revised (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1960; and R. T. France, The Evidence for Jesus (Downers Groove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1986). The last two books come in inexpensive paperback editions and should be available through most religious bookstores. If the first three books are not available in your local library, those in the United States can ask the librarian to order them through inter-library loan.<br>
Jake’s emotions and “inner impressions” clearly sent him down the wrong path. He imagined that it was “providential” that he’d met this other woman and didn’t step back to look at the Bible commands against adultery. And the Bible, “the law and the testimony,” is the authoritative guidebook, the final judge for determining a right course of action (Isaiah 8:20). We must never allow any impression or apparently providential circumstance lead us away from biblical principle.<br>

When the Devil came to tempt Jesus in the wilderness, he suggested, “If you will only forego the painful sacrifices your Father has planned for you, I’ll give you the world in the palm of your hand-with fame, fortune, and a comfortable lifestyle.” Satan even quoted Scripture in an attempt to lead Jesus astray. But each time Jesus fought him off with the words, “It is written” (Matthew 4:1-11). <br>
One powerful lesson we can learn from the life of Jesus is submission to the Father’s will. Even amid the terrible agony of Gethsemane, He cried out, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will” (Matthew 26:39). After three years of His ministry, living day by day in harmony with the Father’s plan, Christ’s dying words were: “It is finished” (John 19:30). Jesus was really saying, “My God-planned life is now complete and fulfilled.”<br>
As you begin to hear God’s voice speaking <br>
coherently through His <br>
Word, providential <br>
circumstances, and direct <br>
impressions, you can learn <br>
to accept His guidance <br>
wholeheartedly. You too <br>
can discover the joy of a <br>
God-planned and a God-<br>
guided life.<br>

They found his skeleton beside a makeshift shelter on a desolate island in the mid-Atlantic. The anonymous seaman kept a journal which detailed his four-month ordeal. He’d been set ashore on Ascension Island by the Dutch fleet in 1725 for some unmentioned crime. Soon he was reduced to drinking the blood of turtles just to quench his raging thirst. The man’s physical suffering was intense, but an even greater pain stands out in his journal: his overwhelming guilt.<br>
He penned tormented words such as: “What pangs do wretched mortals feel who leave the paths of righteousness, pleased to increase the numbers of the damned.” This seaman’s greatest isolation on that lonely island came from his sense of separation from God. That is what proved unbearable in the end.<br>
Human beings have been struggling with that isolation of the heart ever since Adam and Eve “hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden” after eating the forbidden fruit (Genesis 3:8). The strange new emotions of shame, guilt, and fear compelled that first couple to run away when God came calling. Those feelings are unfortunately quite familiar to us now.<br>
What is it that causes a separation between us and God?<br>
“Your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you.”-Isaiah 59:2. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
This great gulf that isolates sinful beings from God is not His doing. God didn’t run from Adam and Eve-they ran from Him.<br>

Before sin spoiled the picture, Adam and Eve enjoyed intimacy with their Creator in a beautiful Garden home in Eden. Tragically, they bought Satan’s lie about becoming as wise as God and broke the bond of trust with their Maker (Genesis 3).<br>
                                                      <br>
After being expelled from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve found life a lot tougher on the outside. Childbearing and tilling the soil now came with blood, sweat, and tears. Their close bond with God broken, they found themselves vulnerable to unsatisfied desires and painful yearnings-the loneliness of sin.<br>
Since Adam and Eve’s first act of rebellion, “all” (the entire human race) have fallen into the same sin pattern and are subject to death, sin’s ultimate penalty.<br>
“Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way DEATH CAME TO ALL MEN, because ALL SINNED.”-Romans 5:12.<br>
                                                      <br>
We all experience a great hunger of the heart for that which we’ve lost, a longing for a kind of security which only God can give. We often try to satisfy that hunger by a shopping binge, or a mad race for promotion at work, or by simply drowning out the hunger with alcohol, drugs, or promiscuity.<br>
But all our yearnings are symptoms of a loneliness for God. And there is no cure except experiencing His love in our life.<br>
                                                      <br>
“You…will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.”-Psalm 16:11.<br>
                                                      <br>
Real satisfaction will only come when that gap between us and God is bridged and we’re able to walk over into His presence.<br>

People are not the only ones made lonely by sin. God’s heart ached too on the day Adam and Eve turned their backs on Him. And He still grieves over human sorrows and tragedies. God is eager to satisfy our hidden longings and to heal our emotional wounds. He wasn’t content just to look sympathetically across the chasm that separates us from Him. God decided to become a bridge across the chasm of sin and death.<br>
                                                      <br>
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”-John 3:16, 17.<br>
God gave His Son, and Jesus gave His life as sacrifice for sin, paying the death penalty Himself. His life, death, and resurrection made it possible to forgive and save sinners without trivializing sin, and gave the universe a demonstration of the true character of Christ and Satan. The bridge of Christ’s broken, bleeding body draws people back from the trap of sin. Love spans the chasm, enabling all who place their faith in Christ as Lord and Savior to walk over into eternal life.<br>

                                                      <strong>1. Jesus Came From Heaven to Earth</strong><br>
How long did Jesus claim to have existed?<br>
“Before Abraham was born, I am!”-John 8:58.<br>
Jesus notified the world: “I am!” I have always existed and always will. Though Jesus was born of a human mother (Matthew 1:22, 23), He is God-God in human flesh.<br>
                                                      <br>
Dwight L. Moody, the Billy Graham of the 19th century, once said of the incarnation of Jesus, “It would have been a great sacrifice for Jesus to come and be rocked in a silver cradle, be nursed by an angel, and be fed with a golden spoon. But the Creator of heaven and earth came and took man’s flesh, and was born in a stable of poor parents in the worst possible environment.”<br>
                                                      <br>
An angel told Joseph at the time of Jesus’ birth:<br>
“She [Mary] will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because HE WILL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS.”-Matthew 1:21.<br>
Jesus, the Creator of the universe (John 1:1-3, 14), was willing to come to our world to rescue us from sin and death.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>2. Jesus Lived a Sinless Life</strong><br>
“Jesus the Son of God,… has been tempted in every way, just as we are-yet was without sin.”-Hebrews 4:14, 15.<br>
                                                      <br>
God did more than try to talk us out of a life of sin and into a more satisfying one. By living here as a Man, Jesus made a life free from sin far more attractive than any sermon ever could.<br>
                                                      <br>
Satan, Christ’s adversary, plotted throughout Jesus’ earthly life to seduce Him into sin. In the wilderness the Devil unleashed his fiercest assault against His integrity (Matthew 4:1-11). In Gethsemane before His crucifixion, the pressure of temptation reached such intensity, Jesus sweat drops of blood (Luke 22:44).<br>
But Christ stood firm against everything the Devil threw at Him-“yet without sin.” Because Jesus experienced the full range of human problems and temptations, He understands our struggles. He is able “to sympathize with our weaknesses” (Hebrews 4:15).<br>
                                                      <br>
Why was it necessary for Jesus to live a sinless life?<br>
“God made Jesus who was sinless, to be sin for us; and in place of our sinful life Jesus gives us His sinless life, that we might be made sinless in Him.”-2 Corinthians 5:21, paraphrased.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus overcame temptation and lived a sinless life so He could pass it on to us in exchange for our old life of sin.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>3. Jesus Died to Take Away Sin</strong><br>
How many people have sinned?<br>
“For ALL have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”-Romans 3:23.<br>
                                                      <br>
What is the penalty for sin?<br>
“The wages of sin is DEATH; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”-Romans 6:23.<br>
                                                      <br>
Why did Jesus die?<br>
“Look, the Lamb of God, who TAKES AWAY THE SIN of the world!” (John 1:29).<br>
All of us have sinned and are subject to eternal death, but Jesus died in our place. He became “sin for us.” He paid the death penalty for us. His dying is a gift, and “the GIFT of God is ETERNAL LIFE in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23).<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus laid down His perfect, righteous life as a gift of love to us. Love like that is almost beyond human comprehension. And because of His death “we have PEACE with God” (Romans 5:1).<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>4. Jesus Arose From the Dead<br>
                                                      </strong>Jesus’ death on the cross wasn’t the end of His remarkable story. He couldn’t very well remain dead and be our Savior.<br>
                                                      <br>
“And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.”-1 Corinthians 15:17, 18.<br>
Mohammed and Buddha have presented to the world some great philosophical truths. They have inspired the lives of millions of people, but they have no supernatural power to give life since they still remain their graves. <br>
                                                      <br>
Because Jesus rose from the tomb the third day after His death, what promise is He able to make to us?<br>
“Because I live, you also will live.”-John 14:19.<br>
Jesus is alive! Because He has a power over death, He can deliver us from death and offer us life that is both abundant and eternal. He will live in our hearts if we invite Him in. The risen Christ is present to meet our needs today.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”-Matthew 28:20.<br>
Men and women all over the world are sharing stories of how Christ has delivered them from the worst addictions and the deepest emotional traumas. <br>
One of our former students wrote these words of gratitude on one of his answer sheets: “I was an alcoholic. One day while drunk, I saw a card in the gutter advertising your Bible course. I picked it up, filled it out, and received my first true knowledge of Christ. Shortly after taking the Bible course, I offered my heart to God and lost the taste for whiskey.”<br>
                                                      <br>
When Jesus took possession of this man’s life, a new power gave him the ability to overcome his addiction. Because Christ is the risen Savior, He can save all who will come to Him for help.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>5. Jesus Ascended to Heaven</strong><br>
Before Jesus returned to the Father after His resurrection (Acts 1:9), He made this promise to His followers:<br>
“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms … I am going there TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU. And … I will come back and take you to be with me… where I am.”-John 14:1-3.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>6. Jesus Ministers as Heavenly Priest</strong><br>
Jesus constantly seeks to prepare us for a place in heaven.<br>
“He had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful HIGH PRIEST in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.”-Hebrews 2:17-18.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus came into our world to “make atonement for the sins of the people,” and rescue us from the misery of enslavement to sin. He died to save us so He can ultimately eradicate the cause of sin, suffering, and death by destroying the Devil.<br>
Jesus as our High Priest was “made like his brothers in every way.” And He now appears continually in the Father’s presence on our behalf as our Mediator. The same Jesus who blessed the children, rehabilitated the woman caught in adultery, and forgave the dying thief on the cross, is working in heaven right now to minister to our needs, “to help those who are being tempted.”<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>7. Jesus Will Return</strong><br>
Before returning to heaven, what promise did Jesus make?<br>
“If I go and prepare a place for you, I WILL COME BACK and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.”-John 14:3.<br>
                                                      <br>
When Jesus returns, He will deliver us from the sin, sickness, tragedy, and death that plague this planet. And He will welcome us into a new world of eternal happiness and immortal life.<br>

The story is told of an arranged marriage in Taiwan between U Long and a young woman named “Golden Flower.” When U Long lifted the veil from his bride after the ceremony, he was shocked and disgusted. Her face had been scarred by smallpox.<br>
                                                      <br>
After that, U Long had as little to do with his wife as possible. She tried her best to make him happy; she worked hard at home, hoping her husband would eventually accept her. But he remained coldly different to all her expressions of affection.<br>
                                                      <br>
After twelve years of this sham marriage, U Long began to lose vision in both eyes. A doctor told him would go completely blind if he didn’t have a cornea transplant. But the operation was expensive and there was a long waiting list.<br>
Golden Flower began to work long hours in the evening making straw hats for extra money. One day, U Long was informed that someone’s cornea had been made available after an accident. He rushed to the hospital to have the operation.<br>
After he had recovered, he grudgingly decided to see his wife so he could thank her for raising the money. When he turned her bowed head so she could look at him, U Long gasped. She stared at him with sightless, blank eyes, the cornea gone. Overcome with emotion, he sank at her feet and sobbed. And then for the first time he whispered her name: Golden Flower.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus longs for a relationship with those who’ve been indifferent to Him for so long. He longs for us to finally whisper His name as our Savior. He was willing to sacrifice not only His eyes but His whole body in order to demonstrate His unfailing love. His love is so powerful that Christ “came into the world to save sinners” (Timothy 1:15).<br>
                                                      <br>
JESUS CAME as God in human flesh.<br>
LIVED a sinless life in our place.<br>
DIED for our sins.<br>
AROSE to deliver us from death.<br>
ASCENDED to prepare a home for us in heaven.<br>
MINISTERS each day as our high priest.<br>
IS COMING SOON to take us to be with Him forever.<br>
                                                      <br>
Christ’s great sacrifice has created a bridge that spans our indifference, that covers our alienation. Have you personally discovered that He wants to draw you<br>
over the chasm and into His arms? Will you respond and pray, “Jesus, I love You.<br>
Thank You for Your incredible sacrifice. Come into my heart and save me now-save me wholly, save me completely, save me eternally”?<br>

After living most of his life as a Buddhist, an elderly man in Singapore who had become a Christian was asked, “Mr. Lim, what difference do you find between being a Buddhist and being a Christian?<br>
“That’s easy,” he answered. “Since I’ve found Jesus as my Savior, I have such a peace in my heart.”<br>
That’s what happens when we center our lives on Christ.<br>
“You [God] will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You.”-Isaiah 26:3 NKJV. (Unless otherwise noted all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER Guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Living the Christian life results in perfect peace-a perfect sense of security and well-being.<br>
Those who have made this discovery have found the only way to a second chance at life-Jesus!<br>

It’s possible for a physically alive person to be having what some call a good time, and still be dead-that is, spiritually dead.<br>
“YOU WERE DEAD IN YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS AND SINS, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, THE [EVIL] SPIRIT WHO IS NOW AT WORK in those who are dishonest.”-Ephesians 2:1, 2.<br>
                                                      <br>
Satan leads a spiritually dead person down a descending spiral of sin and disobedience. But the wonderful truth of the gospel is that God loves such doomed people. He loves them while they are dead in their sins, and offers them a full and free deliverance from their predicament.<br>
                                                      <br>
“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, MADE US ALIVE WITH CHRIST EVEN WHEN WE WERE DEAD IN TRANSGRESSIONS…[to] show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.”-Ephesians 2:4-7.<br>
                                                      <br>
God loved us when we had nothing lovable about us. His grace created in us a new life in Christ. We can't change ourselves, but God can. When we come to Him in faith and submission, He gives us a second chance at life as a free gift.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <strong>1. We need to be saved from sin.</strong><br>
“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”-Romans 3:23.<br>
To put it bluntly: we don’t live up to what we know is right. A parent under stress may blow up and wound a child emotionally. A person may become incensed at another driver and almost cause an accident. A student may grow resentful and whisper unkind things about another student. A businessman may plan to “forget” about a certain source of income at tax time. “All have sinned”; that’s the human condition.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <em>How does the Bible define sin?</em><br>
“All wrongdoing is sin.”-1 John 5:17.<br>
We need to be rescued from all kinds of unhealthy habits and compulsions: lying, abusive anger, lust, bitterness, to name a few.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.”-1John 3:4.<br>
So we need to be saved from sin-breaking God’s commandments.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>2. We need to be saved from a broken relationship with God.</strong><br>
“Your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you.”-Isaiah 59:2.<br>
                                                      <br>
Unforgiven sin cuts off our relationship with God. Christ came to restore trust in God, which Satan had undermined.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>3. We need to be saved from eternal death-sin’s penalty.</strong><br>
“Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned.”-Romans5:12.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>4. We need to be saved from a sinful, unhappy, empty life.</strong><br>
For the sinner, life is a dead-end street.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>5. We need to be saved from a sinful world.</strong><br>
We must be rescued from a world full of sin and its results-misery, heartache, loneliness, war, sickness, and death!<br>

Only Jesus can save us.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>1. Jesus can deliver us from sin.</strong><br>
“You are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”-Matthew 1:21.<br>
A Hindu told a Christian friend, “I find many things in Hinduism not found in Christianity, but there is one thing Christianity has that Hinduism does not have-a Savior.” Christianity is the only world religion offering people a Savior.<br>
(2)Jesus can save us from our broken relationship with God.<br>
“You were separate from Christ… without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.”-Ephesians 2:12, 13.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus is the perfect Friend to enjoy a relationship with. He loves to bring out the best in us. “Through the blood of Christ” our past life of sin is forgiven, and day-by-day He gives us His acceptance, power over sin, and His perfect life. We know He’ll be there to pick us up every time we fall. Our love for Him in turn produces a desire to live in a way that pleases Him. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>3. Jesus can save us from eternal death, sin’s penalty.</strong><br>
“For the wages of sin is [eternal] death; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”-Romans 6:23.<br>
We are lawbreakers sentenced to die. The penalty for sin is death. Jesus saves us from eternal death and gives us eternal life.<br>
                                                      <br>
“God demonstrates his own love for us, in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”-Romans 5:8.<br>
Because of his unfailing love, Jesus “died for us.” And because He died for us and suffered the full results of sin, God can now forgive and accept sinners without trivializing sin.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>4. Jesus can save us from a sinful, unhappy life.</strong><br>
“For if a man is in Christ he becomes a new person altogether-the past is finished and gone, everything has become fresh and new.”-2 Corinthians 5:17, Phillips. <br>
We can’t save ourselves from sin or change our nature on our own any more than a lion can decide to become a lamb (Romans 7:18). Sin is simply stronger than our willpower. But Christ is able to “strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being” (Ephesians 3:16). He works to replace our destructive habits with His healthy qualities: love, peace, joy, kindness, self-control (Galatians 5:22, 23). Christ lives His life through us, and we receive spiritual healing, restoration, and a new life.<br>
                                                      <br>
Harold Hughes had given up hope of ever changing. He’d tried desperately to stop drinking many times. He knew only too well that his battle with the bottle had put his wife and two daughters through ten years of hell. And so he stepped into his bathtub one cold morning and pointed a shotgun muzzle into his mouth. Before pulling the trigger, he decided he’d better explain things to God. That prayer turned into a long, sobbing appeal for help.<br>
                                                      <br>
And God came through. Harold Hughes made a commitment to Christ and found the spiritual strength to persevere. He quit drinking for good, became a loving, dependable husband and father, and went on to earn a seat in the U.S. Senate. Harold Hughes discovered the greatest transforming power in our world-Jesus!<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
                                                      <strong>Step 1. Ask Christ to deal with the sin in your life.</strong><br>
What is our part in getting rid of our sinful life?<br>
“REPENT, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out.”-Acts 3:19.<br>
What leads a person to repent?<br>
                                                      <br>
“GOD’S KINDNESS LEADS YOU TOWARD REPENTANCE.”-Romans 2:4.<br>
“YOUR SORROW LED YOU TO REPENTANCE.”-2 Corinthians 7:9.<br>
Repentance is simply being sorry for our past life of sin, and then turning away from our sins, making a break with the old habits, practices, and attitudes. It’s not sorrow just because we fear punishment, but a response to “God’s kindness” that led Jesus to die in our place for our sinfulness. We reject sin because it hurts God.<br>
When we experience a new life in Christ, we should so far as possible make past wrongs right (Ezekiel 33:14-16).<br>
                                                      <br>
HOW WE RECEIVE A NEW LIFE FROM CHRIST<br>
1.We believe in Him and receive Him as Savior and Lord.<br>
2.We establish a relationship with Him. (A regular time of prayer and Bible reading is vital.)<br>
3.Christ works through His Spirit to replace our bad habits with His good qualities.<br>
                                                      <br>
What is God’s part in getting rid of our old life of sin?<br>
Both repentance and being forgiven are a gift to us from God.<br>
“God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and SAVIOR that he might GIVE REPENTANCE and FORGIVENESS OF SINS.”-Acts 5:31.<br>
And when we repent, a loving Savior forgives our sins, cleanses us from sin, and throws them into the depths of the sea.<br>
                                                      <br>
“IF WE CONFESS our sins, HE IS FAITHFUL and just AND WILL FORGIVE US our sins and PURIFY US FROM all unrighteousness.”-1 John 1:9. (See also Micah 7:18, 19.)<br>
There is no sin so terrible that the Savior who died for our sins on Calvary’s cross can’t forgive. A person who trusts in Jesus need only ask Him for His pardon. Christ’s dying for us can’t pardon us unless we ask to be forgiven. It’s a sobering fact that our sins helped drive those nails through Christ’s hands and feet. And yet Jesus is more eager than we can imagine for us to accept His gift of pardon and reconciliation.<br>
                                                      <br>
Word reached a young man who’d run away from home that his mother was dying. The news filled him with remorse over their broken relationship. Hurrying home, he rushed into the room and threw himself oh his mother’s bed. In a flood of tears he begged her to forgive him.<br>
She drew him close and whispered, “Son, I would have forgiven you long ago if you’d only asked.”<br>
                                                      <br>
If you have drifted away from God-or have not yet come to know Him-please think about how eager your loving heavenly Father is to welcome you home. He wants more than anything else for you to accept His offer of pardon. Jesus loves you. He died for you. He is always willing to forgive you. So respond to His gracious invitation to repent. Confess your sins. Simply believe that God forgives you and he does. Trust him! Trust His promises.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Step 2. Receive a new life from Jesus.</strong><br>
Your part in receiving a new life from Jesus is to believe that Jesus has really saved you. Accept without question the fact that He has forgiven and cleansed you, taken away your old life of sin, and given you an entirely new and changed life.<br>
                                                      <br>
“All… who believed in his name, he gave the right [power, authority, privilege] to become children of God.”-John 1:12.<br>
As a child of God, you have “the right” to receive a new life from Jesus. As we have said, you can’t achieve it on your own-it’s a gift from your heavenly Father! Jesus gives such an absolute promise in order to remove our insecurities and doubts.<br>
                                                      <br>
What is God’s part in giving us a new life?<br>
“Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.’”-John 3:3.<br>
                                                      <br>
According to Jesus, a believing, repentant sinner is actually born into a new life. It is a miracle that only God can perform. He promises:<br>
“I will give you a NEW HEART and put a NEW SPIRIT in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.”-Ezekiel 36:26. <br>
Jesus transforms our heart-our feelings and behavior-and dwells “in us” (Colossians 1:27). This new life is not just a nice, spiritual idea; it’s a hard, solid fact, a resurrection from spiritual death to an entirely new life and existence.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Step 3. Live for Jesus every day.</strong><br>
The Christian life involves a daily turning away from selfishness, and bonding with Jesus as our loving Friend. We grow in this new life by strengthening our relationship with Jesus. This means spending quality time with Him, building honest and open communication. God has given us five divine aids for spiritual growth: Bible study, prayer, meditation, fellowship with other Christians, and sharing our experience with others.<br>
                                                      <br>
Living in Christ doesn’t mean we never make mistakes. But when we stumble and sin, we claim Christ’s forgiveness, and keep going. We’re headed in a certain direction, and we know Christ remains a living presence in our hearts.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Harold Hughes received many honors during his distinguished career as a U.S. Senator, but the one that meant the most to him came shortly after his commitment to Christ.<br>
                                                      <br>
Harold was studying the Bible alone in his living room one evening when he felt a nudge at his elbow. He looked up. It was his two small daughters standing quietly in their nightgowns. He stared at them for a moment; they had changed so much, and he had missed so much during his devastating battle with the bottle.<br>
Then Carol, the younger said, “Daddy, we’ve come to kiss you good-night.”<br>
The father’s eyes blurred. It had been so long since the children had come for his embrace. Now their beautiful clear eyes held no fear. Daddy had come home at last.<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus does truly give people a second chance. He takes the most hopeless cases and creates new beginnings.<br>
                                                      <br>
The Savior longs for each one of us to come home at last. Have you accepted Christ’s loving invitation? Receiving God’s forgiveness and cleansing is as simple and profound as opening your arms for a child’s embrace.<br>
                                                      <br>
If you have not yet trusted in Christ as your personal Savior, you can do so right now by praying something like this:<br>
“Father, I am sorry for my old life of sin. Thank you for sending your Son to this world to die in my place. Jesus, please forgive my sins and come into my life and save me. I want a second chance at life- I want to be born again. Even more, I want to establish a day-by-day relationship with You. Thank you for performing this miracle in me. In Jesus name, Amen”<br>
Make this wonderful discovery: When we do the coming, Jesus does the saving.<br>
                                                      <br>

Doctors Patricia and David Mrazek saw a great deal of heartbreak in their work. As pediatric specialists they dealt with many suffering children. But they were struck by the fact that some kids bounced back from disaster while others were crushed by it. Why? Why, for example, does one child go to drugs, while another goes to college? Why do some abused children grow up become abusers themselves, while others become good parents?<br>
The Mrazeks conducted an extensive survey to find answers to these questions. In their study, one overriding trait kept popping up among those kids who survived trauma and went on to build healthy lives. The secret? “A basic life view of optimism and hope.”<br>
Hope made the difference. Hope, more than anything else, helps us beat the odds when they’re stacked against us.<br>
Human beings desperately need hope. But how do we get it? Hope is hard to find in our world-UNTIL we look at it from the perspective of Bible prophecy. This DISCOVER guide examines a remarkable prophecy that has inspired countless individuals with a vibrant hope.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
About five hundred years before the birth of Christ, God gave the world a startling glimpse into the future through the prophet Daniel. God presented an outline of world history in advance for 2,500 years, from Daniel’s time to our own day.<br>
This prophecy originated in a dream God gave Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, some 2,500 years ago. The dream deeply troubled this monarch-but he couldn’t remember the dream when he woke up! After all of Babylonian’s wise men failed to help the king recall his dream or interpret it, a young Hebrew exile named Daniel arrived on the scene, claiming that the God of Heaven could reveal all mysteries.<br>
Standing before the king, Daniel boldly declared:<br>
“You looked, O king, and there before you stood A LARGE STATUE-an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.”<br>
The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.<br>
“While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.”<br>
“Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But THE ROCK THAT STRUCK THE STATUE became a huge mountain and FILLED THE WHOLE EARTH.”-Daniel 2:31-35. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
This statue, at first glance, may seem to have little to do with finding hope in contemporary times, but hold on.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
After telling a very impressed Nebuchadnezzar exactly what he’d seen in his vision, the prophet Daniel explained:<br>
“This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.”-Daniel 2:36.<br>
THE HEAD OF GOLD: What world power did Daniel tell the king the head of gold symbolized?<br>
“You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory…. YOU ARE THAT HEAD OF GOLD.”-Verses 37, 38.<br>
Daniel was saying to the ruler of the world’s greatest empire: “Nebuchadnezzar, God is telling you that your empire, Babylon, is represented by the statues’ golden head.”<br>
THE CHEST AND ARMS OF SILVER: From a human perspective Babylon looked like an empire that would last forever. But what does the prophecy say would happen next?<br>
“After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours.”-Verse 39.<br>
In fulfillment of God’s prediction, Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom crumbled into ruins when Cyrus, the Persian general, overthrew the Babylonians empire in 539 B.C. So the chest and arms of silver represent Medo-Persia, another mighty empire.<br>
THE BELLY AND THIGHS OF BRONZE: What does this part of the great metal image represent?<br>
“Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.”-Verse 39.<br>
The belly and thighs of bronze of the image symbolize the kingdom of Greece. Alexander the Great conquered the Medes and the Persians, turning Greece into the world’s third great empire. He ruled from 331 to 168 B.C.<br>
THE LEGS OF IRON:<br>
“Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom [said the prophet], strong as iron-for iron breaks and smashes everything-and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others.”-Verse 40.<br>
After the death of Alexander, his empire weakened and split into rival factions until finally in 168 B.C., at the battle of Pydna, the “Iron Empire” of Rome crushed Greece.<br>
Caesar Augustus ruled the Roman Empire when Jesus was born about two thousand years ago (Luke 2:1). Christ and His apostles lived during the period represented by the legs of iron. Gibbon, the eighteenth-century historian, no doubt had Daniel’s prophecy in mind when he wrote: “The images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome.”-Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (John D. Morris and Company), vol. 4, p.89.<br>
Think for a moment about this prediction from a human point of view. How could Daniel, living in the time of Babylon, have any idea of how many empires would succeed each other hundreds of years in the future? We have a hard time figuring out what the stock market is going to do next week! And yet Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome followed each other exactly as predicted-like obedient schoolboys in a line.<br>
Is God in control of the future? Can we have hope on the basis of His grand plan?<br>
The answer is a resounding, Yes!<br>
THE FEET AND TOES OF IRON MIXED WITH CLAY: Would a fifth world power follow Rome?<br>
“Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so THIS WILL BE A DIVIDED KINGDOM; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.”-Daniel 2:41, 42.<br>
The prophet predicted, not a fifth world empire, but a division of the iron monarchy of Rome. Rome would fracture into ten kingdoms, as symbolized by the feet and toes of the image.<br>
Did this actually happen? It certainly did. During the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian Era Barbaric invaders from the north poured down on the decaying Roman Empire, delivering blow after blow. Finally ten of the tribes gained most of the territory of Western Rome, and ten distinct, independent nations established themselves within the boundaries of Europe. Thus the toes symbolize the modern nations of Europe today.<br>

Does Daniel’s prophecy predict that efforts would be made to unite these nations of Europe under one ruler?<br>
“And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so THE PEOPLE will be a mixture and WILL NOT REMAIN UNITED, anymore than iron mixes with clay.”-Daniel 2:43.<br>
Over and over powerful men have tried to unite Europe, but they fall short of the goal every time. Napoleon came nearer than any other man to uniting a divided Europe, but probably thinking of this prophecy, as he fled defeated from the Battlefield of Waterloo, he cried, “God Almighty is too much for me!”<br>
TEN TOES – TEN MAJOR TRIBES IN THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE<br>
Anglo-Saxons&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (England)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (France)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alamanni&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Germany)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lombards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italy)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostrogoths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Later destroyed)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visigoths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Spain)<br>
Burgundians&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Switzerland)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vandals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (North Africa, later destroyed)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Suevi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Portugal)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Heruli&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Disappeared after a few centuries)<br>
                                                      <br>
Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler created the most powerful armed forces of their day. But each failed to unite Europe under their rule. Why? Because God’s Word was at stake: “The people will be a mixture and will not remain united.” The outcome of two world wars confirm that God holds the future in His hands; He is ultimately in control. That’s certainly enough to give us hope, peace, of mind, and confidence in His plan for our lives.<br>

Only one part of Daniel’s prophecy remains unfulfilled. What is the meaning of the stone that strikes the statue on the feet, grinds it to powder, and becomes a great mountain which fills the whole earth?<br>
“IN THE TIME OF THOSE KINGS [the modern nations of Europe], THE GOD OF HEAVEN WILL SET UP A KINGDOM that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but IT WILL ITSELF ENDURE FOREVER.”-Daniel 2:44.<br>
“Those kings” could refer only to the kings symbolized by the feet and toes of the statue-the rulers of modern Europe, pointing to our day. The stone that is cut out without human hands is to strike the statue and break it into pieces, and will then fill the whole earth (verses 34, 35, 45). Soon Jesus will descend from heaven to “set up a kingdom” His kingdom of happiness and peace. Then Christ, the Rock of Ages and the King of Kings, will rule the world forever!<br>
Everything in the prediction of Daniel 2 has come to pass except the final act-the striking of the statue by the stone. According to God’s timetable, we are now approaching the grand climax, Christ’s return to our world. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is about to end the long, bloody struggle of human history and establish His eternal kingdom of love and grace.<br>

This prophecy reveals the guiding hand of God in the rise and fall of nations. God knows the past, and this Bible prophecy clearly shows that He knows the future as well. If God directs the movements of nations with such precision, surely He can guide each individual’s life. Jesus assured us: “Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid” (Matthew 10:30-31). God’s gift of faith can become the antidote to all our worries and fears. The hope He inspires can serve as an anchor for our souls (Hebrews 6:19).<br>
The sixteenth-century scholar Erasmus related an incident during a sea voyage that stayed with him the rest of his life. His sailing vessel ran aground in a storm. As violent waves smashed against the ship and it began to break up, even the sailors panicked. The passengers were near hysteria. Most shouted for help to their patron saint, sang hymns, or pleaded loudly in prayer.<br>
Erasmus noted one passenger, however, who acted very differently. “Of all of us,” Erasmus wrote, “the one who remained most composed was a young woman who was holding a baby whom she was nursing. She was the only one who did not shout, weep or bargain with Heaven. She did nothing but pray quietly to herself while clasping the baby tightly on her lap.”<br>
This prayer, Erasmus realized, was just continuation of her regular prayer life. She seemed to entrust herself to God.<br>
As the ship began to sink, this young mother was placed on a plank, given a spar to use as an oar, and sent out into the waves. She had to hold her baby with one hand and attempt to row with the other. Few thought she would survive the pounding surf.<br>
But her faith and composure stood her in good stead. The woman and her child were the first to reach shore.<br>
Hope in a trustworthy God can make all the difference-even when our world seems to be breaking up around us. We’re not out there paddling on our own. A greater hand is guiding us and holding us up.<br>
If you will come to Christ in full surrender, He will give you a faith that will see you through every storm. Discover the supernatural peace that Jesus promises:<br>
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you…. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”-John 14:27.<br>
Do you have that peace? If you do, thank Jesus, your Savior. If you don’t, why not invite Him into your life today?<br>

After years of mistreatment, Armando Valladares was an emaciated, crippled shadow of his former self. He was serving a 30-year sentence in one of Castro’s prisons for praying in a church on Christmas Day. Prison officials starved, tortured, and humiliated the man, but he refused to give up his faith.<br>
Something kept him going: a promise he’d made to a young woman named Martha. They had met and fallen in love while he was in prison. She was deeply attracted to his passionate faith. Shortly after the couple married in a civil ceremony in the prison courtyard, Martha was forced to emigrate to Miami.<br>
Their separation was very painful. But Armando managed to smuggle out a promise to his beloved. On a tiny piece of discarded paper he scribbled his pledge: “I will come to you. The bayonets in the horizon beyond my back will no longer matter.”<br>
This prisoner determined that somehow he and Martha would make their vows in a church before God. Someday their union would be complete. “You are always with me,” he told her.<br>
Armando’s promise kept him going through years of mistreatment that would have destroyed the spirit of most men. And it kept Martha going. She worked tirelessly to bring public attention to her husband’s plight. She never gave up hope.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
At times we may be tempted to wonder, will Christ really descend someday from this blue sky above us for a wonderful reunion? We’ve been separated for so long. Such a happy ending to the earth’s long, tragic history may appear just too good to be true. But there’s one thing that can keep hope alive in our hearts. And that’s simply Jesus’ promise to return. Just before departing from His disciples into heaven, Jesus made this pledge:<br>
“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms; if it were not&nbsp; so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I WILL COME BACK and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.”-John 14:1-3. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Before ascended to heaven, He assured His followers, “I WILL COME BACK!” He promised to return and take all who trust in Him to the special place He has prepared for us. Scriptures speaks of His second coming approximately 2,500 times. The fact that Jesus is coming to the world a second time is as certain as the reality that He lived on this earth two thousand years ago. <br>
Long ago God promised that a Messiah would come, a Deliverer who would take on Himself our iniquities and provide pardon for human sin. That promise seemed too good to be true to many in the ancient world who were slogging through their lives. But Jesus did come and die on the cross. The promise came true more gloriously than people imagined possible. His promise to return will also come true. We can rely on the One who loves us, to return and gather up those for whom He has paid an infinite price.<br>
Throughout his imprisonment, Armando continued to smuggle poems, messages, and drawings to Martha. And she managed to publish some of these writings. Their eloquence attracted world attention. Government began pressuring Castro to release prisoners of conscience. The French president intervened and at last in October of 1982 Armando was placed on a plane headed for Paris. He hardly dared believe he was free-even after the plane touched down. But then, after two decades of suffering and longing and waiting, Armando rushed into Martha’s arms.<br>
A few months later the happy couple stood in Miami’s St. Kieran Church and repeated their vows. At last their union was complete. The promise was fulfilled: “I will come to you.”<br>
Can you imagine what a wonderful reunion it will be when finally we are able to see Christ face-to-face? His glorious appearing will swallow up all our sorrows and frustrations, wipe away all the pain that we’ve kept hidden in our hearts. Jesus’ return will fulfill our deepest longings and most exciting expectations. And we’ll embark on an eternity of intimate union with the most wonderful personality in the Universe. <br>
Jesus is coming soon! Are you eager to meet Him?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
(1)Will Jesus come in secret?<br>
“See, I [Jesus] have told you ahead of time. So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the desert,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. FOR AS LIGHTNING that comes from the east IS VISIBLE even in the west, SO WILL BE THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.”-Matthew 24:25-27.<br>
Lightning flashes out very visibly for great distances, so the coming of Jesus will not be some secret or subjective event.<br>
(2)Will Jesus come again as a real person?<br>
“They [Jesus’ followers] were looking intently up into the sky as he [Jesus] was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. ‘Men of Galilee,’ they said, ‘why do you stand here looking into the sky? THIS SAME JESUS, who has been TAKEN from you INTO HEAVEN, WILL COME BACK IN THE SAME WAY you have seen him go into heaven.’ “-Acts 1:10-11.<br>
On the day of His departure from our world the angels assured the disciples that the “same Jesus” taken up into heaven-not someone else-would come back in person as King of Kings. The same Jesus who healed the sick and opened blind eyes. The same Jesus who spoke gently to the woman taken in adultery. The same Jesus who wiped away mourner’s tears and welcomed children into His lap. The same Jesus who died on Calvary’s cross, rested in the grave, and rose form the dead the third day. <br>
(3)Will Jesus come so we can see Him?<br>
“Look, he is coming with the clouds, and EVERY EYE WILL SEE HIM.”-Revelation 1:7 (first part).<br>
All who are alive when Jesus comes again, both the righteousness and the wicked, will witness His return.<br>
How many did Jesus Himself say would view His return?<br>
“At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH will mourn. THEY WILL SEE the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.”-Matthew 24:30.<br>
Every living person on our globe will see Jesus return.<br>
(4)Who will accompany Jesus when He comes?<br>
“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory.”-Matthew 25:31.<br>
Imagine what it will be like when Jesus returns in all His splendor surrounded by “all angels.”<br>
(5)Can we predict the exact time of Jesus’ return?<br>
“No one knows about that day of hour, not event the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father…. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”-Matthew 24:36, 44.<br>
Everyone will see Jesus’ glorious arrival, but many will be unprepared for it. Are you personally ready for Jesus to come?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
(1)Jesus will gather all the saved (the elect).<br>
“And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.”-Matthew 24:31.<br>
If you have allowed Jesus to prepare you in heart and life, you will greet Him joyfully as your Savior.<br>
(2)Jesus will awaken the righteous dead.<br>
“For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL RISE FIRST.”-1 Thessalonians 4:16.<br>
Jesus descends from heaven with a shout. His mighty voice is heard around the world. It breaks open graves in every cemetery and resurrects millions of people who have accepted Jesus through the ages. What an exhilarating day that will be!<br>
(3)Jesus will transform all the righteous at His coming-not only the righteous dead, but also the righteous living.<br>
“After that, we who are still alive and are left WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.”-Verse 17.<br>
To prepare us for eternity, Christ changes our mortal bodies that are subject to death into beautiful immortal bodies.<br>
“Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but WE WILL ALL BE CHANGED-in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, AT THE LAST TRUMPET. For the trumpet will sound, THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED IMPERISHABLE, and WE WILL BE CHANGED. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.”-1 Corinthians 15:51-53.<br>
When Jesus comes “we will all be changed.” Just think: no more arthritis, paralysis, or cancer. Shut down the hospitals and close up the funeral homes. Christ has come!<br>
(4)Jesus will take all the righteous people to heaven.<br>
Jesus Himself made the promise, “I will come back and take you to be with me” in My Father’s house (see John 14:1-3). Peter speaks of the inheritance of the redeemed “kept in heaven for you” (1 Peter 1:4). We can look forward to exploring the marvels of God’s city, the New Jerusalem, and getting to know our heavenly Father.<br>
(5)Jesus will eliminate evil and suffering for all time.<br>
The wicked-those who have persistently rejected all of Jesus’ offers of mercy-actually pass sentence on themselves. As they stare at Jesus’ face coming toward them from the clouds, a sudden awareness of their sin proves too painful to bear; they cry to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!” (Revelation 6:16). They prefer death to standing before Jesus’ all-seeing gaze.<br>
They know that the voice now thundering from the sky once tenderly implored them to accept divine grace. Those who lost themselves in the mad rush after money or pleasure or position now realize they’ve neglected the only really worthwhile thing in life.<br>
It is a crushing revelation. After all, not one of them needed to be lost. God Himself finds “no pleasure in the death of the wicked” (Ezekiel 33:11). He is “not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9). Jesus implores us, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). But, incredibly, some turn aside His gracious invitation.<br>

It cost Jesus a great deal to guarantee us a glorious future with Him “in my Father’s house.” It cost Him His life!<br>
“CHRIST WAS SACRIFICED ONCE to take away the sins of many people; and HE WILL APPEAR A SECOND TIME, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.”-Hebrews 9:28.<br>
The Savior who died on the cross to take away your sins will appear “a second time,” and He will “bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.” Christ sacrificed Himself in order to offer salvation to each of us. But without the Second Coming, the cross would be a failure. Christ wants to give us an eternally secure home with Him. In order for that to happen, we must allow Him to rule in our hearts as Savior and Lord right now.<br>
On the morning of August 16, 1945 a small boy ran through the Shantung Compound in North China shouting that he’d spotted a plane in the sky. All the able-bodied internees ran outside and looked up. These men and women had suffered through years of isolation, deprivation, and anxiety, imprisoned by the Japanese as citizens of enemy nations. For many only one thing had kept them spiritually alive: the hope that someday the war would end.<br>
An electric current shot through the crowd of 1500 surviving internees as they realized this plane might be coming for THEM. As the hum of the aircraft grew louder, someone yelled, “Look, there’s the AMERICAN FLAG painted on the side!” and then in an unbelieving daze, voices cried out, “Look, they’re WAVING at us! They know who we are. They’re coming to get us.”<br>
At this point the excitement was more than these ragged, weary, homesick survivors could contain. Pandemonium broke loose. People were running in circles, shouting at the top of their lungs, waving their arms and weeping.<br>
Suddenly the crowd gasped and stared in silence. The underside of the plane suddenly opened and men began floating down in parachutes. Their rescuers weren’t just coming someday; they were coming today, NOW to be in their midst!<br>
The crowd surged toward the compound gate. No one paused to think of the machine guns pointed down from towers. After years of frustration and loneliness, they broke through the gate and rushed to where the paratroopers were landing.<br>
Soon this flood of humanity turned and poured back into camp-with the soldiers on their shoulders. The camp commander surrendered without a fight. The war was indeed over. Freedom had come. The world was brand-new again.<br>
Soon OUR God, OUR Savior, will descend from the clouds to rescue us. The long horror story of man’s cruelty to man will finally cease. There will be jubilation on that day, shouts of joy as we finally understand: “He’s coming close; I can see the angels blowing their trumpets.” The sound gets louder, the cloud of glory brighter, until we can hardly endure it. But we can’t stop looking as we realize: “He sees me. He knows who I am.” We’ll know with indescribable joy: “This is my God. He’s coming for me, not someday, but today, right now.”<br>
Are you ready to welcome the King in all His glory? If not, please invite Jesus personally into your life just now. Even as the coming of Jesus to our world will solve the world’s problems, so His coming into your heart will help you deal with your present daily problems. The great Problem Solver can deliver you from guilt and burden of sin and give you eternal life.<br>
The coming of Jesus into a life can forever change it as dramatically as the coming Jesus to our world will transform it. You can depend on Jesus. He will prepare you for His coming and give the wonderful assurance of a life of eternal happiness.<br>

Marco had traveled to a city full of silver and gold. He’d seen black stones that burned, but no one had ever heard of coal. He’d seen a cloth that refused to catch fire even when thrown into the flames, but no one had ever heard of asbestos. He talked of huge serpents ten paces long with jaws wide enough to swallow a man, nuts the size of a man’s head and white as milk inside, and a substance spurting from the ground that actually set lamps alight. But no one had ever seen crocodiles, coconuts, or crude oil. They just laughed at such stories. Years later, when Marco lay dying, a devout man at his bedside urged him to recant all the tall tales he’s told. But Marco refused: “It’s all true-every bit of it. In fact, I have not told half of what I saw.”<br>
The Bible writers who give us glimpses of heaven seem to echo Marco Polo’s sentiment. In vision they looked on a place so brilliant, so fantastic, that they could describe only a fraction of what they saw. And we face a challenge similar to that of Marco Polo’s friends. We must try to imagine the “crocodiles and coconuts” that we’ve never seen, because the glimpses we do get in the Bible show us that heaven is much more than sitting on clouds and playing on harps.<br>

Jesus is preparing a very real place for us right now in a very real heaven.<br>
“Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me [Jesus]. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I GO TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I WILL COME AGAIN, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”-John 14:1-3, KJV. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Jesus is coming to our world a second time to take us to a custom-made mansion in a heavenly city that is glorious beyond our wildest dreams: the New Jerusalem.<br>
After we’ve lived there for a thousand years, Christ intends to bring this heavenly home down to planet Earth. As the New Jerusalem descends, fire will purify the entire world. Our renewed planet then becomes the permanent home of the saved. (Revelation 20:7-15. More about this in Guide 22.)<br>
What does John, who wrote Revelation, picture next?<br>
“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‘Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.’“-Revelation 21:1-3.<br>
After its transformation by fire, who does Jesus promise will occupy the new earth?<br>
“Blessed are the meek: for they will inherit the earth.”-Matthew 5:5. (See also Revelation 21:7.)<br>
Christ promises to restore His once perfect world to its original Edenic beauty, and the meek “will inherit the earth.”<br>

When Jesus appeared to His disciples in His resurrected and glorified body, how did He describe it?<br>
“Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”-Luke 24:39.<br>
Jesus had a real body; He invited Thomas to touch Him (John 20:27). On this occasion Jesus walked into a real house, talked to real people, and ate real food (Luke 24:43).<br>
Heaven isn’t inhabited by ghost, but by real people who enjoy a spiritual life, and who have a “glorious body.”<br>
“But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.”-Philippians 3: 20, 21.<br>
We can be assured that our heavenly bodies will be as solid and real as Christ’s resurrected body.<br>
Will we recognize our family and friends in heaven?<br>
“Now we see but poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.”-1 Corinthians 13:12.<br>
In heaven we “shall know fully.” We’ll understand and appreciate one another more deeply than we ever have in this present world.<br>
Jesus’ disciples recognized Him in His heavenly body, apparently because of His familiar features (Luke 24:36-43). Mary knew Him at the tomb because of the familiar sound of His voice when He called her by name (John 20:14-16). The two disciples at Emmaus identified Him because of certain familiar gestures. When they noticed the way their guest blessed the food, they recognized Him as the Lord by His manner (Luke 24:13-35).<br>
The redeemed are certain to experience thrilling “face-t-face” reunions in heaven. Imagine the joy of recognizing your spouse’s special smile, or the familiar call of a child you laid to rest long ago, or the endearing gestures of some beloved friend. We’ll have an eternity to deepen-life’s most precious bonds and to develop intimate friendship with the most fascinating personalities in the universe.<br>

We’ll have plenty of activities to challenge us in heaven. How about designing your own dream house?<br>
“Behold, I will create new heavens a new earth…. I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people…. They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit…. My chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands.”-Isaiah 65:17-22.<br>
Jesus is already preparing personalized homes for us in the Holy City, the New Jerusalem (John 14:1-3, Revelation 21). These verses suggest we’ll also design and construct other houses-perhaps beautiful country estates, landscaping them with heaven’s rich variety of plant life. And who knows what high-tech adventures await us in God’s advanced civilization? Our present scientific breakthroughs and space odysseys will seem like child’s play when we begin exploring in our “Father’s house.”<br>
Do you love the beauty of thundering waterfalls, quiet meadows, teeming rain foresees, and delicate blossoms?<br>
“The LORD will surely comfort Zion;… he will make her deserts like Eden, her wastelands like the garden of the LORD. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the sound of singing.”-Isaiah 51:3.<br>
God will transform the earth into a pristine Garden of Eden. No more oil spills or smog or drought; the lakes stay crystal clear, the trees majestic, and the mountainsides unscarred.<br>
Not only the beauties of the world, but also our capacity to absorb them will be greatly intensified. It will seem like that first day outdoors after a very long illness. And the first “twenty minutes of reality” will extend into a magical eternity.<br>
Do you enjoy experiencing new things? Learning? Creating?<br>
“There, immortal minds will contemplate with never failing delight the wonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeeming love….Every faculty will be developed, every capacity increased. The acquirement of knowledge will not weary the mind or exhaust the energies. There the grandest enterprises may be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations reached, the highest ambitions realized; and still there will arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of minds and soul and body. All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God’s redeemed.”-Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy (Nampa, Idaho; Pacific Press Publishing Association, 1950), page 677.<br>

“Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.”-Revelation 21:27.<br>
God is going to completely eliminate sin and its terrible results; they will never appear again. When Jesus appears, “we shall be like Him” (1 John 3:2). Instead of resisting impulses to kill, steal, lie, or rape, we’ll pursue heavenly graces. <br>
“[God] will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”-Revelation 21:4.<br>
Even the ultimate enemy, death, will vanish. In heaven’s land of eternal youth the redeemed are “immortal” (1 Corinthians 15:53); no inhabitant will ever suffer the ravages of old age. <br>
Heaven not only destroys the results of sin, it also reverses them. Imagine what it will be like for those who’ve struggled with lifelong handicaps:<br>
“Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy.”-Isaiah 35:5, 6.<br>

Imagine seeing the Lord of the Universe face-to-face.<br>
“Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.”-Revelation 21:3.<br>
God Almighty promises to be our companion and tutor. What a joy to sit at His feet! Think what a musician might give to be able to spend a few moments with Beethoven or Mozart. Imagine how much a physicist would treasure the chance to sit down with Albert Einstein, or how much it would mean for a painter to talk with Michelangelo or Rembrandt.<br>
Just think, the redeemed will have an infinitely greater privilege. They will converse with the Author of all music, science, and art. They will be on intimate terms with the greatest Mind and deepest Heart in the universe. And this relationship will overflow into worship.<br>
“From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,’ says the LORD.”-Isaiah 66:23.<br>
In the center of the heavenly city stands the great white throne of God. Encircled by an emerald rainbow, His face shines like a blazing sun. Below His feet a glassy sea extends in all direction. On this crystal surface reflecting God’s glory, the redeemed gather to pour out their exultant praise. <br>
“And the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.”-Isaiah 35:10.<br>
Here is Someone whose goodness never misses a beat. His faithfulness and patience and compassion just keep rolling on. Praise His holy name!<br>

Jesus longs for that face-to-face meeting. That’s why He was willing to rescue you from sin at such great cost. You must personally take advantage of this gift. You must make a commitment to Christ as Lord and Savior. You need the pardon that is offered from the cross, because:<br>
“Nothing impure will ever enter [the New Jerusalem], nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.”-Revelation 21:27.<br>
Jesus delivers us from sin, not in sin. We must come to Him through His power in us and be separated from the impure and the unholy. Jesus is our password into His soon-coming kingdom.<br>
And that kingdom can have its beginning right now in your heart. When Christ delivers us from sin, He creates a little heaven within. He can help us deal with the worry, anger, lust, fear, and guilt that plague us. The hope of heaven isn’t an escape from life’s problems; it helps create more heaven on earth. A recently conducted poll showed that “those who believe in life after death lead happier lives and trust people more than those who don’t.”<br>
Nothing will have a more dramatic impact on your life right now than a trusting relationship with Jesus Christ. Listen to how Peter describes the impact of a living faith:<br>
“Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are FILLED WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE AND GLORIOUS JOY, for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.”-1 Peter 1:8, 9.<br>
All of this-and heaven too. Have you discovered the kind of abundant life Christ wants you to experience? Please don’t turn away from His gracious invitation.<br>
“The [Holy] Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come!’ And let him who hears say, ‘Come!’ Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.”-Revelation 22:17.<br>
Jesus is with you now, speaking to your heart as you read these lines. He invites you to “Come!” “Come!” “Come!” He couldn’t be more eager, more insistent. If you have not yet done so, this moment above all others is your opportunity to explore His offer.<br>
Why not tell Him that you accept His gracious gift and want to spend eternity with Him? Tell Him that you love Him. Thank Him for all He has done for you and all He is still planning for you. If there is something between you and God, ask Him to make you willing to remove it. Today, while you hear His voice, while your heart is still responsive, give yourself to Him without reserve. Bow your head at this moment and say, “Jesus, my Lord, I come. I give my all to You. I will be Yours forever.”<br>

Most of us have an almost instinctive urge to peek into the future. We want to know what lies beyond the horizon. But accurate predictions remain terribly elusive. We have a difficult enough time forecasting tomorrow’s weather!<br>
There is Someone, however, whose prophecies have proven remarkably accurate. Jesus Christ, through His Word, can take us into the future; He’s a reliable guide. In this lesson we’re going to look at what He had to say about His second coming. After all, who could know more about the end of the world than the One who created it in the beginning?<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
After Jesus assured His disciples that He would come back to our world a second time (Matthew 23:29), what question did they ask Him?<br>
“’Tell us,’ they said, ‘when will this happen, and what will be THE SIGN OF YOUR COMING and of the end of the age?’”-Matthew 24:3. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
Jesus answered clearly and positively. In chapter 24 of Matthew and chapter 21 of Luke He personally gave several “signs,” or evidences, by which we can know when His coming is near. Other Bible prophecies help fill out the picture, detailing world conditions just before Christ’s return. As we’ll see, these prophecies are being fulfilled before our very eyes; they indicate that Christ’s coming back to earth is near at hand.<br>
Let’s look at ten signposts of Bible prophecy along the highway to heaven, and examine the questions that a modern-day traveler might ask as he reads them.<br>
Signpost 1-Anguish! Terror! Perplexity!<br>
Over nineteen hundred years ago Jesus gave a prophetic description of contemporary life that sounds as if it could have been taken from the evening news:<br>
“There will be SIGNS in the sun, moon, and stars. On the earth, NATIONS WILL BE IN ANGUISH AND PERPLEXITY at the roaring and tossing of the sea. MEN WILL FAINT FROM TERROR, APPREHENSIVE OF WHAT IS COMING ON THE WORLD, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. AT THAT TIME THEY WILL SEE THE SON OF MAN COMING in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”-Luke 21: 25-28.<br>
No more accurate description of today’s world could be penned than: “Men will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world.” Stockpiled weapons are capable of destroying the entire planet. What if some terrorist gets a nuclear warhead?<br>
Jesus gives us a basis for hope in a calamitous age. The current crisis of global “anguish and perplexity” only reinforces the truth that Christ’s coming really is “drawing near.” People today often moan in frustration, “Look what the world has come to!” but the student of Bible prophecy can exclaim with hopeful voice, “Look WHO is coming to our world.”<br>
Signpost 2-World Calamities.<br>
How do natural disasters fit into last-day events?<br>
“There will be great EARTHQUAKES, FAMINES and PESTILENCES in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven…. When you see these things happening, you know that THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NEAR.”-Luke 21:11, 31.<br>
Think about famines for a moment. Images of starving kids with distended bellies persist on the news. Isn’t it rather amazing that a world which can send men to the moon, CANNOT feed all its people? Jesus knew that famines would persist, that selfish human nature would grow worse toward the end of time.<br>
But what about earthquakes? According to World Almanac of 1999, in century after century of the Christian era there has been a striking increase in major earthquakes: 18th century 6 major earthquakes, 19th century 7, 20th century more than 100. So the evidence grows more dramatic as we get nearer and nearer to our present day.<br>
These figures confirm Jesus’ prophecy. Famines and major earthquakes are reaching a crescendo—“the kingdom of God is near!” Will our 21st century bring hundreds more major earthquakes, or the coming of the King of Kings?<br>
Signpost 3-Accumulating Wealth.<br>
What is the meaning of wealth slipping into the hands of fewer and fewer while more and more fall into poverty?<br>
“You have hoarded wealth in the last days.”-James 5:3.<br>
Despite all our economic insights, the rich keep getting richer and the poor poorer. The multi-million dollar fortunes are another signpost that show us “the Lord’s coming is near” (verse 8).<br>
Signpost 4-Civil Unrest.<br>
Why have discontent and unrest among employees risen so dramatically?<br>
“Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. THE CRIES OF THE HARVESTERS [WORKERS] have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. Be patient and stand firm, because THE LORD’S COMING IS NEAR.”-James 5:4, 8.<br>
After predicting an unparalleled piling up of wealth in our day, James foresaw civil unrest arising from discontented workers. The tension between the “haves” and the “have-not’s” continues to increase. Another sign that “the Lord’s coming is near.”<br>
Signpost 5-Moral Decay. <br>
Why does the moral fiber of society seem to be shredding?<br>
“But mark this: There will be TERRIBLE TIMES IN THE LAST DAYS. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God-having a form of godliness but denying its power…. EVIL MEN AND IMPOSTORS WILL GO FROM BAD TO WORSE, deceiving and being deceived.”-2 Timothy 3:1-5, 13.<br>
Could anyone think of a more accurate description of our world? Point a camera in any direction these days and you’ll catch a picture of arrogant materialism. You’ll capture a shocking epidemic of child abuse and molestation. You’ll get countless scenes of youth out of control, kids in their early teens killing and maiming at random. All these things form a gallery of pictures loudly proclaiming that Jesus’ coming is very near.<br>
Signpost 6-Spread of the Occult.<br>
Why are we seeing an explosion of interest in the occult?<br>
“For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect-if that were possible.”-Matthew 24:24.<br>
These passages predict that the time of the end will feature all kinds of miracles and signs, a counterfeit manifestation of the supernatural. Witches and warlocks appear on talk shows. New Agers are everywhere, selling magic crystals and channeling departed spirits. Counterfeit signs and wonders are booming. All this makes it even clearer that just as Jesus predicted, we are living in the time of “the coming of the Son of Man” (verse 27).<br>
Signpost 7-An Awakened World.<br>
What is the meaning of the awakening to world-consciousness of Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the nations of the Far East?<br>
“LET THE NATIONS BE ROUSED;… Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe… so great is their wickedness!’ Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR in the valley of decision.”-Joel 3:12-14.<br>
Today in Asia and Africa, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Middle Eastern countries, we are witnessing perhaps the most widespread awakening of individual nations in all of recorded history, “for the day of the Lord is near.”<br>
Signpost 8-Peace Plans and War Preparations.<br>
We live in a strange world. Everyone agrees that we should give peace a chance. We talk peace; yet pent up hostilities, some centuries old, flare into open conflict. The prophets Micah and Joel predicted that at the very time the nations talk about their desire for peace (Micah 4:1-3), distrust for their neighbors compels them to prepare for war (Joel 3:9-13)<br>
Long ago the Bible pictured our present peace-war dilemma, and declared that permanent peace will reign on earth only when Jesus comes.<br>
Signpost 9-Modern Progress.<br>
Why, after centuries of human history have transportation and communication brought the world so close together?<br>
“UNTIL THE TIME OF THE END, many will go here and there to increase knowledge.”-Daniel 12:4.<br>
Daniel here indicates that knowledge of his prophecies would increase “in” (KJV), or “until the time of the end.” But this prediction also seems to point straight to our computerized information age. Knowledge of all kinds has increased at lightning speed these past few years. There have been more changes in the past fifty years than in the previous two thousand.<br>
“MANY WILL GO HERE AND THERE to increase knowledge.” Before 1850, people moved around by horse and buggy, pretty much as they had from the beginning of time. Now we break the sound barrier and span the globe in everything from Concorde airplanes to space shuttles.<br>
Increased travel and the recent flood of inventions give further evidence that we’re living in “the time of the end”.<br>
Signpost 10-Gospel to All the World.<br>
Jesus predicted that just before His coming the gospel would reach the whole world:<br>
“And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”-Matthew 24:14.<br>
For decades almost half the globe was locked behind an iron curtain, shut away from the Good News. But then almost overnight Eastern Europe slipped from the iron grip of communism. The Berlin Wall came crashing down, and the mighty Soviet Empire fell apart. Suddenly roughly half the planet was opening its arms to the gospel.<br>
The gospel is truly going to the “whole world” as never before. By satellite the Christian message is simultaneously being broadcast to almost every nation. We are living in the very day Jesus spoke of when He declared: “This gospel will be preached in the whole world” and “then the end will come.”<br>

After describing the events that were to characterize the time just preceding His second coming, Jesus concludes His remarks by saying,<br>
“I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.”-Matthew 24:34.<br>
The conclusion is obvious-the generation portrayed by these signposts of prophecy will see Jesus return to earth a second time. It won’t be long until He’ll sweep away sin and suffering, and establish His everlasting kingdom. Jesus cautions, “No one knows… that day or hour” (verse 36).<br>
And Jesus continues:<br>
“You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”-Matthew 24:44.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Christ is the last, best hope for our world because only He can deal with the very thing that is destroying it-sin. Jesus died on Calvary to make possible the defeat of evil and deliverance for all who respond to His offer of salvation.<br>
“He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.”-1 John 3:8.<br>
Our Savior created a way out of our crumbling world by sacrificing His own flesh and blood. And the same Jesus, who will someday cure all the world’s ills by destroying sin, offers right now to erase the guilt of sin from your life. You don’t have to wait for the Second Coming to find release from guilt, and from anxiety and destructive behavior. Jesus is quite willing to give you His kind of peace this very moment.<br>
While attending a religious meeting a young woman felt strangely moved by the gospel presentation. As she heard the story of a soon-coming Savior unfold, all the pieces began to fit into place. This made sense. She decided that she’d been looking for love, happiness, and peace in all the wrong places. Jesus had to be the answer.<br>
The next day when the evangelist and his associate went to see her, she poured out the story of a bitter and broken life. She’d sunk to the bottom as an alcoholic, and was supporting herself through prostitution. After describing her problems, she sobbed out, “You were really speaking to me last night.”<br>
But the voice that had reached her heart was the voice of God. And He was speaking tenderly. She decided to lay it all on the line. She invited Christ to come into her heart as Savior and Lord, and fastened onto the hope of His soon return.<br>
In the weeks that followed, she began to notice that her many fears and insecurities, which she’d always tried to drown in drink, now found release as she spent time communicating with Jesus. He began to deliver her from the compulsions that had been wrecking her life.<br>
She had done a lot of things she wasn’t proud of. But Christ’s grace and forgiveness proved stronger than her shame. The experience of the thief on the cross meant a lot to her. In his last, desperate hours he turned to the Innocent Sufferer beside him asked, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom” (Luke 23:42).<br>
Jesus immediately answered by promising the thief a place with Him in paradise (verse 43). The same Jesus who graciously offered forgiveness to that dying thief, now offers you salvation, complete pardon, and peace of mind. Discover it for yourself today. <br>
You too can pray with the dying thief: “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” And Jesus will answer, “I will come again, and you will be with Me in paradise.”<br>

In 1929 Frank Morris boarded a ship bound for Switzerland. He’d looked forward to this voyage for some time. But it turned into a humiliating experience. A steward put in charge of his care locked Frank in his cabin each night. After a quick breakfast Frank could exercise a bit, but felt foolish being led around the deck, like an animal on a leash. Then the steward deposited Frank in a steamer chair. Whenever he met a friendly passenger who invited him for a stroll, the steward objected, saying he had to keep an eye on him.<br>
Frank was an adult, with the normal curiosities and desires of an adult. But he was also blind. The steward assumed he couldn’t take care of himself. Frank was treated like a parcel that had to be lugged around.<br>
But in Switzerland Frank’s life dramatically changed. While there he learned about dogs which had been trained to guide the blind. Bringing German shepherd named Buddy back to the United States, Frank started Seeing Eye, now a worldwide organization.<br>
Now, with Buddy at his side, Frank could go anywhere, anytime, with anyone. He felt free at last. During one demonstration to a group of reporters at a busy cross street in New York City, Buddy guided his master expertly from one lane to the other while cars whizzed past. Because he trusted Buddy, Frank made it across with ease. The sighted reporters had a much more difficult time; one actually took a cab to get to the other side.<br>
In the next few pages we’re going to learn about the Holy Spirit, a Guide who wants us to place our lives in his hands. All of us are handicapped by the same human nature, the same blindness to what’s really most important. Life rushes by us at such a frantic pace that we often find ourselves just coping instead of going anywhere. Still, we’re hesitant to trust our lives completely to this Guide. But the discovery that awaits each of us is this: we’ll find real freedom and power by depending on the Holy Spirit to guide us through life.<br>

When Christ was about to ascend into heaven, He promised His disciples a priceless gift:<br>
“But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, THE COUNSLEOR will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.... When he, THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH, comes, HE WILL GUIDE YOU into all truth…. HE WILL BRING GLORY TO ME by taking from what is mine and making it known to you.”-John 16:7, 13, 14. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
In the divine plan, Jesus needed to return to heaven as our representative before God’s throne and “appear for us in God’s presence” (Hebrews 9:24). While our crucified Lord represents us in heaven, we also have the Holy Spirit as our COUNSELOR and GUIDE right here on earth. He is Jesus’ direct representative.<br>
While here Jesus ministered within the confines of a human body, and couldn’t be present everywhere. But the Holy Spirit was no such limitations; He can serve as a personal Counselor and Guide to countless individuals in many places at the same time. Christ meets our needs through the Holy Spirit.<br>

Most of us can relate to God the Father if we imagine the most caring, nurturing parent we have ever known. And we can picture Jesus the Son, because He lived among us as a person. But the Holy Spirit is harder to picture and relate to. We have no easy human comparisons. The Bible, however, does give us specific information about the Holy Spirit:<br>
A Personality. Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as a person, a member of the Godhead, along with God the Father and God the Son:<br>
“Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the FATHER and of the SON and of the HOLY SPIRIT.”-Matthew 28:19.<br>
The Spirit has personal characteristics: a mind (Romans 8:27); wisdom (1 Corinthians 2:10); feelings of love toward us (Romans 15:30); feelings of grief when we sin (Ephesians 4:30); the ability to teach us (Nehemiah 9:20); and power to guide us. <br>
Involvement in Creation. The Holy Spirit participated in the forming of our world with the Father and the Son.<br>
“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth…. And the SPIRIT OF GOD moved upon the face of the waters.”-Genesis 1:1, 2, KJV. <br>
                                                      <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
(1)Changing the human heart. In His encounter with Nicodemus, Jesus emphasized the role of the Holy Spirit in changing the human heart:<br>
“I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is BORN OF water and THE SPIRIT.”-John 3:5.<br>
To be “born of the Spirit” means that the Spirit gives us a new beginning. It’s more than a matter of modifying our behavior a bit. The Spirit changes us from the inside out, fulfilling the promise: “I will give you a new heart” (Ezekiel 36:26).<br>
(2)Making us aware of wrongdoing and giving us a desire for holiness.<br>
“When he [the Holy Spirit] comes, HE WILL CONVICT the world of guilt in regard to SIN and RIGHTEOUSNESS and judgment.”-John 16:8.<br>
When you hear the dramatic story of someone turning from an immoral lifestyle to God and becoming a faithful spouse and nurturing parent, remember that every step toward wholeness came as a result of the prompting of the Holy Spirit.<br>
(3)Guiding us in our Christian life. Christ speaks to us directly through the “still small <br>
voice” of the Spirit.<br>
“Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, ‘This is the way; walk in it.’”-Isaiah 30:21.<br>
Through satellite transmission, our TVs regularly bring images and faces from a continent away into our living room. The Holy Spirit functions a little like God’s satellite, bringing the presence of Christ from heaven to earth, making Him close when we need Him most (John 14:15-20).<br>
(4)Aiding our prayer life.<br>
“We do not know what we ought to pray for, BUT THE SPIRIT HIMSELF INTERCEDES FOR US with groans that words cannot express… in accordance with God’s will.”-Romans 8:26, 27.<br>
When we are struggling to find the words, the Spirit is praying in our behalf. When we are so discouraged we can only groan toward God, the Spirit amplifies our faint cry for help into a powerful prayer before the very throne of God where Jesus is now ministering. <br>
(5)Developing Christian qualities and character. The Spirit makes spiritually barren <br>
individuals as fertile as a tree bearing all kinds of fruit:<br>
“BUT THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.”-Galatians 5:22-23.<br>
Having the fruit of the Spirit demonstrates that we are grafted into the true vine, Jesus (John 15:5). Jesus can actually live His abundant life through us by the power of the Spirit.<br>
(6)Preparing us as witnesses. Jesus promises:<br>
“YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER when the HOLY SPIRIT comes on you; and you will be MY WITNESSES… to the ends of the earth.”-Acts 1:8.<br>
All who are willing can be made witnesses by the Spirit. We may not have all the answers, but the Spirit can give us a story to tell that moves hearts and minds. The apostles had trouble communicating before Pentecost, but after the Spirit came they proclaimed Christ with such power that they “turned the world upside down” (Acts 17:6, KJV).<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Scripture makes a distinction between God’s gift of the Holy Spirit to every believer for victorious Christian living, and the various gifts of the Spirit provided to believers for effective ministry in different ways.<br>
“When he [Christ] ascended on high, he led captives in his train and GAVE GIFTS to men’… It was he who gave SOME to be APOSTLES, some to be PROPHETS, some to be EVANGELISTS, and some to be PASTORS and TEACHERS, to prepare God’s people for works of service.”-Ephesians 4:8, 11-12.<br>
Each Christian does not receive all the gifts, some may receive more gifts than others; the Spirit “gives them to each one, just as he determines” (1 Corinthians 12:11). The Spirit equips each believer for his or her special role in God’s plan. God knows when and where to provide the gifts that will best bless His people and His church.<br>
Another list of spiritual gifts found in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 includes wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, prophecy, speaking in different kinds of tongues, [languages, margin], and the interpretation of languages (verses 8-10).<br>
Paul urges us to “eagerly desire the greater gifts” then adds, “and now I will show you the most excellent way.” (1 Corinthians 12:31). The love chapter (1 Corinthians 13) that follows this verse emphasizes that “the most excellent way” is the way of love. And love is the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22).<br>
Our concern should be to seek the fruit of the Spirit and then let the Spirit distribute His gifts to us as “he determines” (1 Corinthians 12:11).<br>

On the Day of Pentecost, the Spirit was poured out in unlimited measure, fulfilling Jesus’ promise:<br>
“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses… to the ends of the earth.”-Acts 1:8.<br>
At Pentecost the Spirit enabled the apostles to communicate the gospel clearly in the languages of people “from every nation under heaven” (Acts 2:3-6).<br>
Some Bible students compare the coming of the Spirit to the falling of the early autumn and the late spring rains of Palestine (Joel 2:23). The Spirit falling at Pentecost was like the “early rain” of autumn which caused the seeds to sprout and provided vital nourishment for the Christian church in its infancy.<br>

Bible prophecy tells of a day coming when the Spirit of God will be poured out like a shower on the church, energizing the church’s members as witnesses (Joel 2: 28, 29). Centuries have now passed and the story of salvation has spread over a large part of the earth. It’s now time for the “latter rain” to ripen the grain, making it ready to harvest.<br>
As history moves to a climax just before Christ’s second coming, God will prepare every sincere believer for heaven through a great outpouring of His Spirit. Are you now experiencing the “early rain” that is preparing the church for the “latter rain” of the Spirit? Are you living a Spirit-filled life? As you are empowered by the Spirit, will you let God use you to communicate the news of His incredible love and soon return?<br>

At Pentecost the Holy Spirit moved those who heard the gospel to cry out, “Brothers, what shall we do?” (Acts 2:37).<br>
“Peter replied, ‘REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. AND YOU WILL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.’”-Acts 2:38.<br>
Repentance-turning away from a sinful way of life and turning to Christ-is a condition for receiving the gift of the Spirit. To have the Spirit poured out on us, we must first repent and commit our lives to Christ. Jesus also emphasized the willingness to follow Him and obey Him as a condition for receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit (John 14:15-17).<br>

Before leaving the world, Jesus instructed His followers:<br>
“Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the GIFT my Father promised… For John BAPTIZED WITH WATER, but in a few days you will be BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT.”-Acts 1:4, 5.<br>
Over and over the Scripture indicates that the Christian is to be “filled with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 2:4; 4:8, 4:31; 6:3, 6:5; 7:55; 9:17; 13:9, 13:52; 19:6). The Holy Spirit makes the life of a Christian fulfilling and beautiful because a Spirit-filled life achieves Christ’s ideal for us.<br>
While describing the Spirit-filled Christian life, Paul offered this prayer for every believer:<br>
“I pray that out of his glorious riches HE MAY STRENGTHEN YOU WITH POWER THROUGH HIS SPIRIT IN YOUR INNER BEING, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith…. Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, ACCORDING TO HIS POWER THAT IS AT WORK WITHIN US.”-Ephesians 3:16, 17, 20.<br>
Like Frank Morris with his faithful guide dog Buddy, we can, with the Holy Spirit guide inside us, do immeasurably more than we could before. With new desires and new abilities we are enabled to move forward confidently instead of just trying to cope with life’s problems.<br>
This Spirit-filled experience is renewed each day through prayer and Bible study. Prayer keeps us in close contact with Christ, and studying the Word of God keeps us focused on His resources. They break down any barrier between us and Christ that might prevent Him from pouring out His priceless Gift of the Spirit. This is how we grow and replace bad habits and attitudes with healthy qualities.<br>
Romans 8 gives an exciting description of the Spirit-filled life. Read it when you can, and note now many times Paul points to the “Spirit” as the power behind the Christian life.<br>
Have you made the wonderful discovery of the Spirit-filled life? Are you conscious of the presence of the Spirit in your life? Are you experiencing His life-giving power? Open up your life to the greatest power in the universe.<br>

When a Scottish lad named Peter got lost in a grassy wasteland on an inky black night, God called him by name: “Peter!” When the heavenly voice called out again, Peter stopped in his tracks, looked down, and discovered he was a step away from plunging into an abandoned limestone quarry.<br>
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could each hear God calling us by name? Wouldn’t it be great if He were that close a companion-if we could actually sit down together and have a long chat about our struggles and dreams?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Believe it or not, we can come nearer to Jesus now than we could if He actually lived here with us as a visible person. Having Christ in the flesh in our town would be wonderful of course, but think of the enormous crowds pressing for a closer look. Think of the demands on His time. We would do well to get a few minutes of direct conversation in lifetime.<br>
Christ wishes to cultivate a personal relationship with every one of us. That’s one reason why He left this earth for a special ministry in heaven that would allow Him to come near to each of us every day. Because Jesus is not limited to one place like when He was here on earth, through the Holy Spirit He is now near to guide the life of every willing person individually.<br>
What encouraging promise did Jesus give just before He ascended to heaven?<br>
“I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS, to the very end of the age.”-Matthew 28:20. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
What is Christ doing in heaven that makes it possible for Him to be “with you always”?<br>
“Therefore, since WE HAVE A GREAT HIGH PRIEST who has gone through the heavens, JESUS THE SONE OF GOD, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are- yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”-Hebrews 4:14-16.<br>
Note the assurances of having Jesus as our personal representative in heaven: “Tempted in every way, just as we are.” “Sympathize with our weaknesses.” “Help us in our time of need.” With Jesus as our High Priest we’re no longer cut off from a distant heaven; Christ can usher us into the very presence of God. No wonder we’re urged to “approach the throne of grace with confidence.”<br>
What place does Jesus occupy in heaven?<br>
“But when this priest [Jesus] had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD.”-Hebrews 10:12.<br>
The living Christ- someone who understands- is our personal representative on the throne “at the right hand of God.”<br>
How did the life of Jesus prepare Him to be our priest?<br>
“For this reason he had to be made like his BROTHERS in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, HE IS ABLE TO HELP those who are being tempted,”-Hebrews 2:17, 18.<br>
Our “brother” who shares our humanity and was “tempted” like we are, is now our High Priest at the Father’s right hand. “Made like” us, He knows what we’re going through. He’s been hungry, thirsty, tempted, and exhausted. He’s felt the need for sympathy and understanding.<br>
But above all, Jesus is qualified to be our High Priest because He died to “make atonement” for our sins. He paid the price for our sins by dying in our place. This is the Gospel, the Good News for all human beings everywhere and for all time.<br>
One of our Bible School directors shares this experience: “When our youngest daughter was three, she caught her finger in a folding chair, splintering the bone. As we rushed her to a doctor, her loud cries of pain really tore at our hearts. And they touched our five-year-old in a special way. I’ll never forget her words after the doctor had cared for her sister’s injury. She sobbed, ‘Oh, Daddy, I wish it could have been my finger!’”<br>
When all humanity were crushed by sin and condemned to die eternally, Jesus said, “Oh, Father, I wish it could have been Me.” And the Father gave Jesus His wish at the cross. Our Savior has experienced every agony we have suffered- and more!<br>

When the people of Israel camped at the foot of Mount Sinai, God instructed Moses to build a portable sanctuary for worship “according to the pattern shown you [Moses] on the mountain” (Exodus 25:40). Nearly 500 years later, King Solomon’s great stone temple replaced the portable sanctuary. And the temple was built on precisely the same plan as the portable sanctuary.<br>
When God gave Moses the direction for building the sanctuary, what specific purpose did He have in mind?<br>
“Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I WILL DWELL AMONG THEM.”-Exodus 25:8.<br>
Sin caused a tragic separation between human beings and their Creator. The sanctuary was God’s way of showing how He can again live among us. The sanctuary, and later the temple, became the center of religious life and worship in Old Testament times. Each morning and evening the people could gather around the sanctuary and establish contact with God in prayer (Luke 1:9, 10), claiming God’s promise: “I will meet with you” (Exodus 30:6).<br>
The Old Testament teaches the same gospel of salvation as does the New Testament. Both portray Jesus dying for us and ministering to us as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.<br>

The sanctuary and its services reveal what Jesus is doing now in the temple in heaven, and what He is doing now on earth to enrich and guide each of us in our daily lives. <br>
Since the earthly sanctuary was patterned after the temple in heaven, it reflects the heavenly sanctuary where Christ now ministers. Exodus 25-40 describes the services and ceremonies of the wilderness sanctuary in great detail. A brief summary of the sanctuary furnishings appears in the New Testament:<br>
“Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary…. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained… the stone tablets of the covenant [on which God wrote the Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 10:1-5)]. Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover [mercy seat].”-Hebrews 9:1-5.<br>
The sanctuary had two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. A courtyard was laid out in front of the sanctuary. In the court stood the brass altar on which the priests offered sacrifices, and the laver in which they washed.<br>
The sacrifices offered on the brass altar symbolized Jesus, who through His death on the cross became “the lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29). When the repentant sinner came to the altar with his sacrifice and confessed his sins, he received forgiveness and cleansing. In the same way, the sinner today obtains<br>
forgiveness and cleansing through the blood of Jesus (1John 1:9).<br>
In the first room, or Holy Place, the seven-branched lampstand burned continually, representing Jesus as the never-failing “light of the world” (John 8:12). The table of consecrated bread symbolized His satisfying our physical and spiritual hunger as the ever-present “Bread of Life” (John 6:35). The golden altar of incense represented Jesus’ prayer ministry for us in the very presence of God (Revelation 8: 3, 4).<br>
The second room, or Most Holy Place, contained the gold-covered ark of the covenant. It symbolized the throne of God. Its atonement cover, or mercy seat, represented the intercession of Christ, our High Priest, interceding on behalf of sinful human being who have broken God’s moral law. The two tablets of stone on which God wrote the Ten Commandments were kept below the mercy seat. Golden cherubim of glory hovered over the mercy seat on each end of the ark. A glorious light shone between these two cherubim, a symbol of the presence of God Himself.<br>
A curtain hid the Holy Place from the view of the people as the priests ministered to them in the courtyard. A second curtain in front of the Most Holy Place blocked this inner room from the priests who entered the sanctuary’s first room.<br>
When Jesus died on the cross, what happened to the curtain?<br>
“At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.”-Matthew 27:51.<br>
The Most Holy Place was exposed when Jesus died. After the death of Jesus no curtain can come between a holy God and a sincere believer; Jesus, our High Priest, ushers us into the very presence of God (Hebrews 10:19-22). We have access to the throne room of heaven because Jesus is our High Priest at God’s right hand. Jesus enables us to come into God’s presence-into the Father’s heart of love. So “let us draw near.”<br>

Just as the earthly sanctuary served as a miniature reproduction of the heavenly temple where Jesus now ministers for us, the services carried on in the earthly sanctuary were “a copy and shadow of what is in heaven” (Hebrews 8:5). But there is a striking difference: The priests who served in the earthly temple could not themselves forgive sin, but at the cross Jesus “appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself” (Hebrews 9:26).<br>
The Old Testament book of Leviticus describes in detail the services carried on in the sanctuary. The ceremonial rituals were divided into two parts: the daily services and the yearly services. (Guide 13 details with the yearly services.)<br>
In the daily services, the priests offered sacrifices for the individual and for the entire congregation. When a person sinned, he would bring an unblemished animal as a sin offering, “lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:29). The guilt of the sinner must be transferred to the guiltless animal by confession of sin and the laying on of hands. This symbolized Christ taking on our guilt at Calvary; the sinless One became “sin for us” (2 Corinthians 5:21). The sacrificial animal had to be killed and its blood shed because it pointed forward to the supreme penalty that Christ suffered on the cross.<br>

“Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness” (Hebrews 9:22). What happened in the Old Testament sanctuary pointed forward to Christ’s one great saving act. Having died for our sins, He entered the holy places “once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption” for us (verse 12). When Jesus’ blood was shed on the cross for our sins, “the curtain of the temple [in Jerusalem] was torn in two from top to bottom” (Matthew 27:51). Because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, animal sacrifices were no longer necessary.<br>
When Jesus spilled His blood from the cross, He was offering up His perfectly obedient life as a substitute for our failures. When the Father and Son were torn apart at Calvary, the Father turned away in anguish and the Son died of a broken heart. God the Son stepped into history to take on Himself the full results of sin and to demonstrate how tragic wrongdoing really is. He could then forgive sinners without trivializing sin. Christ made “peace through his blood, shed on the cross” (Corinthians 1:20)<br>

What is Jesus’ day-to-day work in heavenly temple?<br>
“Therefore he is able also to save completely [forever, margin] those who come to God through him, because HE ALWAYS LIVES TO INTERCEDE for them.”-Hebrews 7:25.<br>
Jesus now “lives” to present His blood, His sacrifice, on our behalf. He is now working diligently to save every human being from the tragedy of sin. Some mistakenly assume that, as our Intercessor, Jesus is in heaven begging a reluctant God to forgive us. In fact, it is God who joyfully accepts His Son’s sacrifice on our behalf.<br>
As our High Priest in heaven, Christ also pleads with humanity. He works to help the indifferent take a second look at grace, to help despairing sinners grasp hope in the gospel, and to help believers find more riches in the Word of God and more power in prayer. Jesus is molding our lives in harmony with God’s commandments and helping us develop characters that will stand the test of time.<br>
God laid down His life for every person who has ever lived in this world. And now, as High Priest or Mediator, “He always lives” to lead people to accept His death for their sins. Although He reconciled the whole fallen world to Himself on the cross, He still can’t save us unless we accept His grace. People will not be lost because they are sinners, but because they refuse to accept the pardon Jesus offers.<br>
Sin destroyed the intimate relationship Adam and Eve once enjoyed with God. But Jesus, as the Lamb of God, died to free all humanity from sin and restore this lost friendship. Have you discovered Him as your High Priest, the One who ever lives to keep that relationship close and vibrant?<br>
Christ’s sacrificial death is utterly unique. Christ’s heavenly ministry is incomparable. Only Christ brings God close beside us. Only Christ makes it possible for the divine Spirit to actually dwell in our hearts. He emptied Himself in order to make us full. He deserves a similar commitment from us. Let’s accept Him fully as the Savior and Master of our lives.<br>

There were no fingerprints. No weapon was ever discovered. No one saw the murderer enter the office of the doctor. No one even heard the shots ring out. But the doctor was found sprawled behind his desk. Five bullets had pierced his shirt.<br>
It seemed the perfect crime. The police at first could find no clues. But then they noticed a tiny wire attached to a pencil holder on the doctor’s desk. The wire led to a tape recorder in a desk drawer. The pencil holder, they realized, actually concealed a microphone that the doctor used to record his conversations with the patients he was counseling.<br>
The investigators quickly rewound the tape and, to their amazement, began to listen to a replay of the actual crime. A man named Anthony had entered the office and began a heated argument with the doctor. Shots rang out. The tape ended with the terrible moans of the doctor, dying on the carpet.<br>
Every awful detail had been recorded. The murderer thought his crime would forever remain a secret. He’d been so careful to leave no clues. But the tape told the whole story.<br>
In this guide we’re going to learn about God’s final judgment when human beings are “judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books” (Revelation 20:12). For those who have not accepted Christ as their Savior, it will be bad news. But the judnment is wonderfully good news for those who’ve found security in Christ.<br>

Who will judge the world?<br>
“The Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.”-John 5:22. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
How did the cross prepare Christ to become our Judge?<br>
“God presented him [Jesus] as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice,… so as to be JUST AND THE ONE WHO JUSTIFIES those who have faith in Jesus.”-Romans 3:25, 26.<br>
Christ’s death as our substitute enables Him to act as both a just Judge and a gracious Justifier who can forgive the repentant sinner. When the watching universe asks the question, “How can an impartial judge declare a guilty person not guilty?” Christ can answer by pointing to the scars in His hands. He has received the just penalty for our sins in His own body.<br>
The books of heaven preserve a record of every individual life, and these records are utilized in the judgment (Revelation 20:12). That’s the bad news for those who imagine their secret sins and crimes will never return to haunt them. But there is wonderfully good news for all who’ve sincerely accepted Christ as their Advocate in heaven: “The blood of Jesus… purifies us from all sin” (1 John 1:7).<br>
What does Jesus offer in exchange for our life of sin?<br>
“God made him [Christ] who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”-2 Corinthians 5:21.<br>
Our life of sin is exchanged for Christ’s perfect life of righteousness. Because of Jesus’ sinless life and death, God can forgive us and treat us as if we’d never sinned.<br>
What qualifies Jesus to be our Advocate and Judge?<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
At His baptism, Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit:<br>
“As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lightning on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’”-Matthew 3:16, 17.<br>
Following Christ’s anointing by the Holy Spirit at His baptism, the disciples announced:<br>
“We have found the Messiah’ [the Christ].”-John 1:41.<br>
The disciples knew that the Hebrew word “Messiah” and the Greek word “Christ” both mean “the anointed One.”<br>
Luke, a disciple of Jesus, recorded the date of Jesus’ anointing as the Messiah as the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar (Luke 3:1). To us that would be the year A.D. 27.<br>
 More than 500 years before Jesus came the prophet Daniel predicted that Jesus would be anointed as the Messiah in A.D.27:<br>
“From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One,…will be seven ‘sevens’ [weeks, Hebrew] and sixty-two ‘sevens’ [weeks].-Daniel 9:25.<br>
Seven weeks and sixty-two weeks total sixty-nine weeks or 483 days (7 X 69 = 483 days). In symbolic Bible prophecy each day equals one year (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34), so the 483 days equal 483 years. Daniel predicted that command would go forth to restore and rebuild Jerusalem and exactly 483 years after this command, the Messiah would appear.<br>
Did Jesus appear as the Messiah at the appointed time? Artaxerxes issued the decree to rebuild Jerusalem in 457 B.C. (Ezra 7:7-26). The 483 years, then, ended in A.D.27 (457 B.C. + A.D.27 = 484.) The decree went forth during the year 457 and Christ was anointed during A.D.27, making them both partial years, so the correct time would be 483 years.)<br>
At the very time appointed, in A.D.27, Jesus appeared with message: “The time has come” (Mark 1:15). The accurate fulfillment of this Bible prophecy is impressive confirmation that Jesus of Nazareth is indeed the Messiah, God in human flesh.<br>
How long was Jesus to confirm the promise?<br>
“He will confirm a covenant [a promise] with many for one ‘seven’ [week, Hebrew].”-Daniel 9:27, first part.<br>
When we apply the year-day principle, this “week” would be seven years. So, for seven years-from A.D.27 to A.D.34-Jesus would “confirm a covenant” or promise, He had made to Adam and Eve shortly after they sinned. God made a covenant, a promise, that He would save the human race from sin through the death of Someone He would send to die for our sins (Genesis 3:15).<br>
What was to happen in the middle of this seventieth week?<br>
“In the middle of the ‘seven’ [week, Hebrew] he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.”-Daniel 9:27, last part.<br>
Jesus was crucified in A.D.31, in “the middle of the week.” At the moment of Christ’s death, God tore “the curtain of the temple… in two from top to bottom” (Matthew 27:51). The sacrificial offering about to be slain (a symbol of Jesus “the Lamb of God”) escaped from the priest’s hands. This was a sign that God no longer wanted humanity to offer animal sacrifices. Fulfilling prophecy down to the letter, Jesus “put an end to” any need for further sacrifices to be offered. Since Christ’s death, people gain access to God not through animal sacrifices and human priests, but through the Messiah, the Lamb of God and our High Priest.<br>

According to Daniel’s prophecy, why did Jesus die?<br>
“The Anointed One will be cut off but not for himself.”-Daniel 9:26, margin.<br>
At his death on the cross, Jesus was “cut off.” He died, “but nor for himself.” Not to pay a penalty for His own sin, but to pay the penalty for sins of the entire world.<br>
How can we know that God has forgiven all our sins?<br>
“Righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe….ALL HAVE SINNED…, and are JUSTIFIED freely BY HIS GRACE through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus…THROUGH FAITH IN HIS BLOOD.”-Romans 3:22-25.<br>
The key points in these verses are: We “all have sinned,” but because of God’s “grace,” all “are justified” who have “faith” in the cleansing power of Christ’s “blood.” When we are justified, God declares us not guilty, taking away the guilt of our past sins. And God declares us righteousness; “righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ.”<br>
All of us who are worn out by the struggle to be good enough, to measure up on our own, can find real rest in Christ’s gracious acceptance. He promises, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). All of us who are burdened by scars from the past and by an aching sense of inadequacy and shame, can find peace and wholeness in Christ.<br>

In the eighth chapter of Daniel an angel showed the prophet a great panorama of the future. Daniel saw (1) a ram, (2) a he-goat, and (3) out of one of the horns of the he-goat, “another horn which started small and grew in power” (Daniel 9:8, 9); symbols representing (1) Medo-Persia, (2) Greece, (3) Rome (Daniel 8:1-12, 20-26).<br>
What is the fourth part of the prophecy?<br>
“’How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled-the vision concerning the daily sacrifice…?’ He said to me, ‘It will take 2,300 evening and mornings [or days, Hebrew]; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated [cleansed].’”-Daniel 8:13, 14.<br>
Daniel fainted before the angel could explain the 2,300-day part of he prophecy, and the eighth chapter closes with no interpretation of it. But later the angel reappeared and stated:<br>
“Understand the vision: seventy ‘seven’ [weeks, Hebrew] are decreed [cut off, Hebrew] for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness.”-Daniel 9:22-24.<br>
The 2,300 days are, of course, 2,300 years, each day standing for a year (Ezekiel 4:6). Seventy weeks, or 490 years, constituted the first section of the longer period of 2,300 years. Both time periods started in 457 B.C. when Persia used the decree “to restore and rebuild Jerusalem.” Subtracting 490 years from the 2,300 years, leaves 1,810. Adding 1,810 years to A.D.34, when the 490 years ended, brings us to A.D. 1844.<br>

The angel told Daniel that in 1844, at the end of the 2,300 years “the sanctuary will be cleansed” (Daniel 8:14, KJV). But what does that mean? Since A.D.70 when the Romans destroyed the temple at Jerusalem, God’s people have had no temple on earth. So the sanctuary to be cleansed, beginning in 1844, has to be the heavenly sanctuary of which the earthly temple was a replica.<br>
Now, what does the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary mean? Ancient Israel called the day for cleansing the earthly sanctuary Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It was really a day of judgment.<br>
As we discovered in Guide 12, Christ’s activity for us in the sanctuary has two phases: (1) The daily sacrifices focus on the priest’s ministry in the first room of the sanctuary, the Holy Place. (2) The yearly sacrifice concentrates on the High Priest’s ministry in the second room, the Most Holy Place (Leviticus 16).<br>
In the earthly sanctuary, as people confessed their sins day by day, the blood of slaughtered animals was sprinkled on the corner of the altar, then transferred to the Holy Place (Leviticus 4 and 6). Thus, in symbol, day after day the confessed sins were brought into the sanctuary and laid up there.<br>
Then each year, on the Day of Atonement, the sanctuary was cleansed from all sins confessed during the past year (Leviticus 16). To effect this cleansing, the High Priest made a special sacrifice of a consecrated goat. He then carried its blood into the<br>
                                                      <br>
At the end of the 2,300 years, “the sanctuary will be cleansed.”<br>
                                                      <br>
(Please refer to Guide 13 p.4 for more details.) <br>
                                                      <br>
Most Holy Place and sprinkled this cleansing blood before the atonement cover to show that the blood of Jesus, the coming Redeemer, would pay the penalty for sin. The High Priest then symbolically removed the confessed sins from the sanctuary and placed them on the head of another goat, which was led out into the wilderness to die (Leviticus 16:20-22).<br>
This ceremony on the yearly Day of Atonement cleansed the sanctuary from sin. The people regarded it as a day of judgment because those who refused to confess their sins were considered unrighteous and were “cut off from [God’s] people” (23:29).<br>
What the High Priest did symbolically once a year, Jesus does once for all time as our High Priest (Hebrews 9:6-12). In the great judgment day He removes from the sanctuary the confessed sins of all who have accepted Him as their Savior. If we have confessed our sins, He will forever blot out the record of our sins at that time (Acts 3:19). This ministry is the work of judgment that Jesus began in 1844.<br>
In 1844 when the hour of God’s judgment began in heaven, a judgment hour message began to be preached throughout the world (Revelation 14:6-7). A future DISCOVER guide will deal with this message.<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Since 1844 Christ, as Judge, has been investigating the record of each person who has ever lived to confirm who will be among the saved when Jesus comes. As our Judge, Jesus “wipe out” all of the sins of the righteous from their life record in heaven (Acts 3:19).<br>
When your name comes up in judgment, it will be easy to face your life record-IF you’ve accepted Christ as your Substitute. And when the judgment of the righteous is finished, Jesus returns to earth to reward them (Revelation 22:12, 14).<br>
Are you ready for Jesus to come? Or is there something you’ve been hiding from Him? Do you have an open and honest relationship with the One who promises:<br>
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.”-1 John 1:9.<br>
Confession simply means agreeing to face our sins, accept God’s forgiveness, and acknowledge our need of His power and grace.<br>
While visiting a prison in Potsdam, King Frederick William I listened to a number of pleas for pardon. All the inmates swore that prejudiced judges, perjured witnesses, or unscrupulous lawyers were responsible for their imprisonment. From cell to cell the same story of wronged innocence continued. <br>
But at one cell the inmate had nothing to say. Surprised, Frederick joked, “I suppose you are innocent too.”<br>
“No your majesty,” the man answered, “l am guilty and richly deserve all that I get.”<br>
The king turned to the guard and called out loudly, “Come and release this rascal quickly, before he corrupts this fine lot of innocent people.”<br>
How do we prepare for the judgment? How do we get ready for Christ to come? Simply by an honest confession of the truth: I richly deserve the penalty of death for my sins, but Another has taken my place and given me a wonderful pardon.<br>
Make a commitment right now that whatever happens, you’ll keep your relationship with Christ eye-to-eye honest and heart-to-heart sincere.<br>

Anatoli Levitin, a Russian writer and historian, spent years in the Siberian Gulag where petitions to God must have seemed frozen to the ground. But he came back quite spiritually fit. “The greatest miracle of all is prayer,” he wrote. “I have only to turn mentally to God and at once I feel a force that pours into me from somewhere, into my soul, my whole being. What is it? Where would I, an insignificant old man and tired of life, get this strength which renews and saves me, elevating me above the earth? It comes from outside me- and there is no force in the world which could ever resist it.”<br>
In this guide we will see how prayer can help us build a stronger relationship with God and a robust Christian life.<br>

How can we be sure God hears us when we pray?<br>
“Then you will call upon me and come and PRAY TO ME, and I WILL LISTEN TO YOU. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.”-Jeremiah 29:12, 13. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New the International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
What assurance did Jesus give that He will hear and answer our prayers?<br>
“So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.”-Luke 11:9.<br>
Prayer is a two-way conversation. That’s what Jesus promises:<br>
“Here I am! I stand at door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.”-Revelation 3:20.<br>
How is it possible to sit down and have a nice evening of dinner conversation with Christ? First, by telling Him everything that’s on our hearts in prayer. Second, by listening carefully. As we meditate in prayer, God can speak to us directly. And as we read the Word of God devotionally, God will speak to us through its pages. <br>
Prayer can become a way of life for the Christian.<br>
“PRAY CONTINUALLY; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”-1 Thessalonians 5:16-18.<br>
How can we “pray continually”? Do we have to stay on our knees all the time or constantly repeat phrases of adoration or petition? Of course not. But we are to live so closely in touch with Jesus that we feel free to speak to Him anytime, anywhere.<br>
“In the crowds of the street, in the midst of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God and plead for divine guidance…. We should have the door of the heart open continually and our invitation going up that Jesus may come and abide as a heavenly guest in the soul.”-Step to Christ, p.99.<br>
One of the best ways to develop this kind of intimate relationship is to learn to meditate as we pray.<br>
“May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.”-Psalms 104:34.<br>
Don’t just rush through a list of requests when you pray. Wait. Listen. A little prayerful reflection can greatly enrich your relationship with God.<br>
“Come near to God and he will come near to you.”-James 4:8.<br>
The closer we come to Jesus, the more we’re able to experience His presence. So keep within speaking distance of Jesus, and don’t worry about saying the right words. Just talk honestly and openly. Talk about everything. He’s gone through the agony of death itself in order to become your Intimate Friend.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
When we engage in prayer, we may wish to follow the outline of the Lord’s Prayer, the model prayer Jesus taught His disciples in response to their request: “Teach us to pray.”<br>
“Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one, for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.”-Matthew 6:9-13, margin.<br>
According to the pattern Jesus provided in His prayer, we are to come to God as our heavenly Father. Ask that His will take charge in our hearts just as His will prevails in all of heaven. We seek Him for our physical needs, forgiveness, and for a forgiving attitude. Remember that our ability to resist sin comes from God. Christ’s prayer concludes with expressions of praise.<br>
On another occasion Jesus instructed His disciples to pray to the Father “in my name” (John 16:23)-that is, to pray in harmony with Jesus’ principles. That’s why Christians usually close their prayers with the words: “In Jesus’ name, Amen.” Amen is a Hebrew word that means “Let it be so.”<br>
Although the Lord’s Prayer gives guidelines on what to pray for and how to formulate a prayer, our communication with God works best as a spontaneous composition of the heart.<br>
We can pray about everything. God invites us to pray about forgiveness for our sins (1 John 1:9), increased faith (Mark 9:24), the necessities of life (Matthew 6:11), healing from suffering and disease (James 5:15), and the outpouring of the Spirit (Zechariah 10:1). Jesus assures us that we can take all our needs and cares to Him; nothing is too small to pray about.<br>
“Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.”-1 Peter 5:7.<br>
Our Savior is interested in every detail of our lives. His heart warms when our hearts reach out to Him in love and faith.<br>

Most of us have things we hesitate sharing even with our closest friends. So God invites us to unburden ourselves in private prayer: one-on-one with Him. It’s not that He needs any information. The Almighty knows our secret fears, hidden motives, and buried resentments better than we do ourselves. But we need to open up our hearts to the One who knows us intimately and loves us infinitely. Healing can begin when Jesus can touch our wounds.<br>
When we pray, Jesus, our High Priest, is near to help us:<br>
“We have one who has been TEMPTED IN EVERY WAY, JUST AS WE ARE-yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”-Hebrews 4:15, 16.<br>
Do you feel anxious, stressed-out, guilty? Lay it out before the Lord. He can then supply our every need.<br>
Should we have a special place for private prayer?<br>
“When we pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who… will reward you.”-Matthew 6:6<br>
In addition to praying when walking in the street, working on the Job, or enjoying a social gathering, every Christian should have a time set aside each day for personal prayer and Bible study. Make your daily appointment with God at the time when you feel most alert and can concentrate the best.<br>

Joining with others in prayer creates a special bond and invites God’s power in a special way.<br>
“For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.”-Matthew 18:20.<br>
One of the greatest things we can do as a family is to develop a prayer life together. Show your children that we can take our needs to Him directly. They’ll get excited about God as they see Him respond to prayer in the practical details of life. Make family worship a happy, relaxed time of sharing.<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
When Moses prayed, the Red Sea parted. When Elijah prayed, fire came down from heaven. When Daniel prayed, an angel shut the mouths of ravenous lions. The Bible presents us with many exciting accounts of answered prayer. And it recommends prayer as the way to tap into the mighty power of God. Jesus promises:<br>
“You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.”-John 14:14.<br>
Yet some prayers seem to go unheeded. Why? Here are seven principles that will help you pray more effectively:<br>
(1)Keep close to Christ.<br>
“IF YOU REMAIN IN ME and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you.”-John 15:7.<br>
When we make our relationship with God a priority and keep in touch with Him, we’ll be listening and looking for answers to our prayers that, otherwise, might go undetected.<br>
(2)Keep trusting God.<br>
“If you BELIEVE, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”-Matthew 21:22.<br>
To believe, or have faith, means that we’re really looking to our heavenly Father to supply our need. If you’re troubled by a lack of faith remember that our Savior performed a miracle for the man who pled in desperation:<br>
“I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!”-Mark 9:24.<br>
Just concentrate on exercising the faith you DO have; don’t worry about the faith you DON’T have.<br>
(3)Surrender calmly to God’s will.<br>
“This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything ACCORDING TO HIS WILL, he hears us.”-1 John 5:14.<br>
Remember that God wants to teach us, as well as give us things, through prayer. So sometimes He says. “No”; sometimes He turns us in another direction. Prayer is a means of getting more and more in touch with God’s will. We need to be sensitive to God’s responses and learn from them. Keeping track of specific requests and what happens as a result is a great help.<br>
The Holy Spirit will help you zero in on the right mark: “The Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God’s will” (Romans 8:27). Remember that our will would always coincide with God’s will if we could see as He does.<br>
(4)Wait patiently on God.<br>
“I WAITED PATIENTLY for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.”-Psalm 40:1.<br>
The main point here is to keep your focus on God, keep your focus on His solution. And don’t ask God for support one minute and then try to drown your troubles in pleasure-seeking the next. Wait patiently on the Lord; we badly need that discipline.<br>
(5)Don’t hang on to any sin.<br>
“If I had CHERISHED SIN IN MY HEART, the Lord would not have listened.”-Psalm 66:18.<br>
Known sin short-circuits the power of God in our lives; it separates us from God (Isaiah 59:1-2). You can’t hang onto sin with one hand and reach out for divine help with the other. Sincere confession and repentance solves the problem.<br>
If we’re not willing to allow God to free us from evil thoughts, words, and deeds, our prayers won’t be effective.<br>
“When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.”-James 4:3.<br>
God isn’t going to answer “yes” to selfish prayers.<br>
Keep your ears open to God’s law, His will, and He will keep His ears open to your petitions.<br>
“If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, even his prayers are detestable.”-Proverbs 28:9.<br>
(6)Feel the need of God.<br>
God responds to those who ask for His presence and power in their lives.<br>
“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.”-Matthew 5:6.<br>
(7)Persist in Prayer.<br>
Jesus illustrated the need to persist in our petitions by telling the story of a very persistent widow who kept coming to a judge with her request. At last the judge said in exasperation, “Because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice,” then Jesus concluded: “Will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?” (Luke 18:5-7).<br>
Discuss all your needs, hopes, and dreams with God. Ask for particular blessings, for help in time of need. Keep seeking, and keep listening, until you learn something from God’s response.<br>

The Psalmist rejoiced that through the ministry of the angel of the Lord his prayers were answered:<br>
“I sought the LORD, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears…The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them.”-Psalm 34:4-7.<br>
When we pray, God sends angels to answer our prayers (Hebrews 1:14). Each Christian has an accompanying guardian angel:<br>
“See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that THEIR ANGELS in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.”-Matthew 18:10.<br>
Because of our prayers:<br>
“The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace pf God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”-Philippians 4:5-7.<br>

The Bible describes a distinct Christian lifestyle. According to Ephesians 4:22-24, the Christian is to “put off” the old lifestyle that resulted from “deceitful desires,” and “put on” the new lifestyle that is “created to be like God.” In this scripture and in Guide 6 we discovered that at the new birth we are “re-created” to be a different kind of person in Christ.<br>
This guide and the six guides which follow, showcase the Christian lifestyle; they reveal the secrets of a happy Christian life. They will help you build a stronger relationship with Christ, that will result in a distinct Christian lifestyle. So fix your eyes on Jesus today and you can be part of that final victory celebration when Christ’s peace reigns unchallenged.<br>

In 1943, Japanese occupation forces ordered hundreds of American and European “enemy nationals” to an internment camp in China’s Shantung Province. They had to endure months of boredom, frustration, overcrowding, and fear. Personalities clashed, tempers flared. Petty squabbles multiplied.<br>
But one man was described by an internee as “without a doubt the person most in demand and most respected and loved in camp”-Eric Liddell, a missionary Scotland.<br>
A Russian prostitute in camp would later recall that Liddell was the only man who’d ever done anything for her without wanting to be repaid in kind. When she first came into camp, alone and snubbed, he put up some shelves for her.<br>
Another internee recalled, “He had a gentle, humorous way of soothing ruffled tempers.”<br>
At one angry meeting of the internees, everybody was demanding that someone else do something about the restless teenagers who were getting into trouble. Liddell came up with a solution. He organized sports, crafts, and classes for the kids, and began spending his evenings with them.<br>
Liddell had won fame and glory at the 1924 Olympics, taking a gold medal in the 400 meters race. But in that cramped compound he showed himself a winner in the Christian race as well, earning the admiration of the most worldly internees.<br>
What made him so special? You could have discovered his secret at 6 a.m. each morning. That’s when he tiptoed quietly past sleeping companions, settled down at a table, and lit a small lamp to illuminate this notebook and Bible. Eric Liddell sought grace and strength each day in the riches of God’s Word.<br>

The Bible was written as a guidebook for the Christian. It is full of stories of real people like us who have experienced the same challenges we face every day. Getting to know these Bible characters-their joys and sorrows, their problems and opportunities-helps us mature as Christians.<br>
The psalmist David pictures our daily dependence on the Word of God by comparing it to a flashlight [torchlight]:<br>
“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.”-Psalms 119:105. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of Bible [NIV].)<br>
The illumination we get each day from the Bible makes clear the qualities we need in our lives and the principles of spiritual growth. Above all, the Bible presents us with Jesus, the Light of the World. Life only makes sense when Jesus is shining on it.<br>

Christ wants the Bible to be as real to you as a personal letter from a close friend.<br>
“I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.”-John 15:15.<br>
Jesus wants the very best for us. His Word brings us into God’s inner circle: those He confides in and personally instructs.<br>
“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.”-John 16:33.<br>
In order to experience this peace, this secure relationship with Christ, we need to read the letters He sends us. That’s what the Bible is: correspondence from heaven. Don’t leave those letters unopened. The transforming message you need is in the Word.<br>
Here is one typical testimony about the Bible’s impact: “I needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was supplied, the hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me the revelation of Christ. I believe in Jesus because He is to me a divine Savior. I believe the Bible because I have found it to be the voice of God to my soul.”-The Ministry of Healing, p.461.<br>

A brief look at the Ten Commandments will help us understand why they and the Bible are an indispensable basis for right living.<br>
The Commandments naturally fall into two divisions, the first four define our relationship to God, and the last six define our relationship to other people. They are found in Exodus 20:3-17.<br>
The first two commandments outline our relationship to God and to His worship.<br>
I.“You shall have no other gods before me.”<br>
II.“You shall not make for yourself an idol… You shall not bow down to them or worship them….”<br>
The 3rd and 4th commandments sketch our relationship to God’s name and to His holy day.<br>
III.“You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God…”<br>
IV.“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all you work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God….”<br>
Commandments 5 and 7 safeguard family bonds.<br>
V.“Honor your father and your mother....”<br>
VII.“You shall not commit adultery.”<br>
Commandments 6,8,9, and 10 protect us in social relationships.<br>
VI. “You shall not murder.”<br>
VIII.“You shall not steal.”<br>
IX.“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.”<br>
X.“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”<br>
The Ten Commandments define our relationship both to God and to other people. They are the guidepost of a Christian lifestyle.<br>

One day as Jesus was teaching, an enthusiastic young man buried up to Him and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?” (Matthew 19:16). Christ could see that he was wrestling with a money problem and advised him to get rid of his possessions and “obey the commandments” (verse 17).<br>
The young man tried to sidestep Christ’s diagnosis of his problem by asking which commandments He was talking about. Jesus listed several of the Ten Commandments (Verse 18, 19).<br>
Finally, the “rich young ruler” turned and walked away sadly (verse 20-22). He could give mental assent to the Ten Commandments, but he couldn’t obey the spirit of the law by abandoning his selfish way of life.<br>
The Ten Commandments show us the boundaries within which healthy relationships, with God and each other, can grow. Jesus pointed to obedience as the way to real joy:<br>
“If you OBEY MY COMMANDS, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father’s commands and remain in his love. I HAVE TOLD YOU THIS SO that my joy may be in you and THAT YOUR JOY MAY BE COMPLETE.”-John 15:10, 11.<br>

The book of Ecclesiastes is a report of Solomon’s search for happiness. He records his quest for happiness in the riches of the world: magnificent houses, productive vineyards, beautiful gardens, and orchards of luscious fruit. He multiplied servants. He found himself surrounded with every material thing a person could desire. But happiness eluded him, and he wrote:<br>
“When I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind.”-Ecclesiastes 2:11.<br>
Solomon then turned to searching out the pleasure of this world in hope of finding the happiness. He was taken in by wine, women, and song. His conclusion:<br>
“Meaningless! Meaningless!...Everything is meaningless!”-Ecclesiastes 12:8.<br>
Solomon has once tasted and seen that the Lord is good. As he compared his early life of obedience to God with his reckless chase for happiness in the things of sin, his verdict: <br>
“Here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.”-Ecclesiastes 12:13.<br>
Solomon felt he could find a shortcut to happiness in a wild life. Toward the close of his life, he was man enough to admit his error. To save others from the same error, he wrote,<br>
“He that keepeth the law, happy is he.”-Proverbs 29:18, KJV.<br>

In the New Testament, James testified:<br>
“For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker. Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.”-James 2:10-12.<br>
Charles Spurgeon, the great Baptist preacher of the past century, declared: “The law of God is divine law-holy, heavenly, perfect…. There is not a command too many; there is not one too few, but it is so incomparable that its perfection is proof of its divinity.”<br>
John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist church, wrote this about the enduring nature of the law: “The moral law contained in Ten Commandments…. He [Christ] did not take away…. Every part of this law must remain in force upon all mankind and in all ages.”-Sermons, vol.1, pp.221, 222.<br>
Billy Graham, the world’s most respected evangelical evangelist, regards the Ten Commandments so highly that he has written an entire book about their importance to the Christian.<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>

The Bible and the Ten Commandments are an unchangeable, indispensable, perfect guide to happy living. Yet hearts are still in conflict. One woman expressed it like this: “I believe the Ten Commandments are binding, I am certain that keeping them leads to happiness. I have tried my very best to keep them, but I just can’t do it. I’m beginning to believe that no one else can.”<br>
The tendency of the natural person is to try to live a life of obedience to God’s commands. But in answer to such trying, over and over again from within the blackened heart of a person comes the frustrated response, “I can’t obey!” Why? Because: <br>
“The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.”-Romans 8:7.<br>
What is the purpose of the Ten Commandment law?<br>
“Through the law we become conscious of sin.”-Romans 3:20.<br>
The function of the law is to lead us to utter realization that we are hopelessly lost sinners in need of a Savior.<br>
“The law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.”-Galatians 3:24.<br>
Jesus is the answer! Once we are at Jesus’ feet in absolute helplessness, by faith we can receive forgiveness for our sins and power from Him to obey His commandments.<br>
                                                      <br>
1.LOVING OBEDIENCE TO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS<br>
Jesus tells us that obedience is the result of love:<br>
“If you love me, you will obey what I command.”-John 14:15.<br>
If we love God, we will obey the first four commandments which define our relationship to God; and if we love people, we will obey the last six which define our relationship with others.<br>
The person who tramples on the Ten Commandments sins:<br>
“Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.”-1 John 3:4.<br>
But thank God, we have a Savior who came to this world and died, was resurrected, and now lives for one purpose:<br>
“But you know that He appeared SO THAT HE MIGHT TAKE AWAY OUR SINS.”-Verse 5.<br>
Our Savior forgives and removes our sinfulness (1 John 1:9). He then promises to give us His love to love with-the great antidote to a life of selfishness and sin:<br>
“GOD HAS POURED OUT HIS LOVE IN OUR HEARTS by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.”-Romans 5:5.<br>
We have no innate ability to keep God’s law. God’s love “poured out… in our hearts” is our only hope.<br>
                                                      <br>
2.GOD’S GRACE AND OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW<br>
Salvation is a gift. We cannot earn it. We can only accept it by faith. We can receive justification (right standing with God) as a gift, solely through faith because of God’s grace.<br>
“For it is BY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED, through FAITH-and this not from yourselves, it is THE GIFT OF GOD-not by works, so that no one can boast.”-Ephesians 2:8.<br>
We cannot keep the commandments by our own works-by trying. We cannot keep the commandments to be saved. But when we come to Jesus in faith and submission and are saved, his love fills our hearts. As a result of this divine grace and acceptance, we desire to follow Him and obey Him through the power of His love in our hearts (Romans 5:5).<br>
Paul stresses the futility of human effort and indicates that we are not under the law as a way of salvation, but “under grace.”<br>
“Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!”-Romans 6:15.<br>
Why? Because a heart motivated by love produces a life of loving obedience! (Romans 13:10). To love Christ is to obey Him:<br>
“Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me.”-John 14:21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Eric Liddell demonstrated that, even in the worst of circumstances, the believer who is plugged into God’s power can live a contented, obedient life. Liddell demonstrated a winsome grace in a time of stress and fear. His love relationship with Christ energized him with the Holy Spirit, and enabled him to meet “the righteous requirements of the law” (Romans 8:1-4). A love relationship with the crucified and risen Savior can produce that <br>
Have you discovered this secret for yourself? Jesus’ love for you caused Him to give His life for your sin. He offers to empower all your relationships with His love and to “equip you with everything good for doing His will” (Hebrews 13:21). What is your response?<br>

Just a few years ago some were predicting we would soon have more leisure time than we’d know what to do with. There were good reasons for those confident predictions. In the cities of the world computers were crunching through month-long tasks in fractions of a second. And robots had begun to handle the grueling jobs of heavy industry.<br>
But after the computers have been whirring and the automation automating, we’re more out of breath than ever. People are running out of times these days. Above all, families are running out of time. Husbands and wives find it hard to schedule “quality time” with the kids, much less with each other.<br>
One study in a small community showed that the average time per day that fathers spent alone with their very young sons was-37 seconds! Families are out of time and out of touch.<br>
How can we slow down enough to get in touch again?<br>

Jesus understands the problems of families under stress and He wants us to understand that spiritual rest is part of the quality life:<br>
“COME TO ME, all you who are weary and burdened, and I WILL GIVE YOU REST…. LEARN FROM ME, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find REST FOR YOUR SOULS.”-Matthew 11:28, 29. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
The Bible suggests we experience this kind of rest into two ways: coming to Christ on both a daily and a weekly basis.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Crowds constantly clamored for Jesus’ attention. And yet Christ communicated a peaceful, tranquil spirit to everyone around Him. How? He invested time each day communing with His heavenly Father. He depended on His Father continually for resources to meet life’s challenges (John 6:57).<br>
If we are to live the serene, steady life that He did, we must continually depend on Jesus-let His Word and Spirit fill us and shape us. The best way to counter the forces burning us out as individuals and tearing us apart as families is to invest quality time with Christ. He tells us:<br>
“REMAIN IN ME, and I will remain in you…. APART FROM ME YOU CAN DO NOTHING.”-John 15:4, 5.<br>
One of the greatest needs of our time is for people to tap the spiritual resources available through forming a day-by-day relationship with Jesus. One very important point that needs to be emphasized about our relationship with Christ is His finished work on the cross. True rest, real security, can only exist because of the great accomplishment Jesus referred to when He cried out as He was dying: “It is finished” (John 19:30). In other words, His work of redeeming us was completed.<br>
“But now he [Christ] has appeared ONCE FOR ALL… TO DO AWAY WITH SIN by the sacrifice of himself.”-Hebrews 9:26.<br>
When Jesus died, He did “away with sin.” That’s why it’s said that the believer who has confessed his or her sins can “rest” in the finished work of Christ. We’re accepted. <br>
Guilt lies behind much of the frantic pace of our lives today. But Jesus solved the guilt problem once and for all at the cross. Jesus’ cry, “It is finished,” sealed His promise of “I will give you rest” as an established fact. Christ completed the work of redeeming us at Calvary (Titus 2:14), then He rested in the tomb over the Sabbath, and rose from the grave Sunday morning as the Victor over sin and death. The Christian can have no greater assurance than to rest in the finished work of Christ.<br>
“Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart IN FULL ASSURANCE OF FAITH,… Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for HE WHO PROMISED IS FAITHFUL.”-Hebrews 10:22, 23.<br>
Because He “who promised is faithful,” we can enter into the salvation-rest Jesus has promised. The stability, peace, and rest we experience in Jesus every day is a result not of anything we do, but of what He did at the cross.<br>
We can rest in Christ because our salvation is assured. That assurance motivates us to spend time with Christ each day, feeding on His Word and breathing in the atmosphere of heaven through prayer. A rendezvous with Jesus helps us turn a stressed-out lifestyle into a peaceful and purposeful life.<br>

After Christ created the world in six days (Colossians 1:16-17), He provided Sabbath-rest. It is a weekly opportunity for us to cultivate our connection with Him.<br>
“God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. By the seventh day God had finished the work he has been doing; so on the seventh he RESTED from all his work. And God BLESSED the seventh day and MADE IT HOLY, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.”-Genesis 1:31-2:3.<br>
As their Creator, Jesus “rested” on the first Sabbath with Adam and Eve, and He “blessed” the Sabbath day and “made it holy.” God established a seven-day weekly cycle, not for His own benefit, but for Adam and Eve and for us today. Because He cared so much for the people He had made, He planned that every seventh day throughout their lives should be dedicated to seeking His presence. Each Sabbath, as He called it, was to be a day of both physical rest and spiritual refreshment. The entrance of sin into our world only made the need for Sabbath rest more acute.<br>
The same Savior who promised Adam and Eve “rest,” about two thousand years later gave the law to Moses on Mount Sinai (1 Corinthians&nbsp; 10:1-4). Jesus chose to place the Sabbath-rest commandment at the very heart of the Ten Commandments. The fourth commandment reads:<br>
“REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY BY KEEPING IT HOLY. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he RESTED on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD BLESSED the Sabbath day and MADE IT HOLY.”-Exodus 20:8-11.<br>
God established the Sabbath as a day to “remember” the Lord who “made the heavens and the earth.” Sabbath-rest each week links us with the Creator who blessed this day and set it apart.<br>
When Jesus lived on earth, He took advantage of every opportunity to sustain His union with the Father. He benefited from Sabbath-rest by worshipping on Sabbath, as Luke tells us:<br>
“He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and ON THE SABBATH DAY he went into the synagogue, AS WAS HIS CUSTOM.”-Luke 4:16.<br>
If the divine-human Jesus needed to rest in His Father’s presence on the Sabbath day, we human beings certainly need it more. When Jesus swept aside the legal restrictions the Jews had placed on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:1-12), He pointed out that God had made it to benefit people:<br>
“He said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.’”-Mark 2:27, 28.<br>
Jesus highlighted the importance of the Sabbath even in His death. He died on Friday, “the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin” (Luke 23:54). At that moment He declared, “It is finished,” that is, His work of coming to this world and dying as substitute for the human race was complete (John 19:30; 4:34; 5:30). Then to celebrate His finished mission, Jesus rested in the tomb over the Sabbath.<br>
Just as Christ completed His work of creation on the sixth day and then rested on the seventh day, so through dying on the cross He completed His work of redemption on the sixth day, and then rested on the seventh.<br>
On Sunday morning Jesus came out from the tomb, a victorious Savior (Luke 24:1-7). He had already asked His disciples to maintain the Sabbath encounter with Him after His resurrection. Speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem, which took place nearly forty years after His death, He charged them: <br>
“Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.”-Matthew 24:20.<br>
Our Savior wanted His disciples and their converts to continue the practices He had taught them (John 15:15, 16). He wanted them to experience both salvation-rest and Sabbath-rest. They did not disappoint Him. The disciples continued to observe the Sabbath after Christ’s death (see Luke 23:54-56; Acts 13:14; 16:13; 17:2; 18:1-4). <br>
The beloved apostle John kept up his weekly link with Christ on the Sabbath day. In his later years he wrote, “On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit” (Revelation 1:10). According to Jesus, “the Lord’s Day” is the Sabbath, “for the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:8).<br>
On the Sabbath we celebrate the Lord’s two greatest accomplishments on our behalf: creating us and saving us. This Sabbath experience will continue in heaven:<br>
“’As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,’ declares the LORD,…‘from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,’ says the LORD.”-Isaiah 66:22, 23.<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
People today are trampling over each other in their frantic life. Individuals are burning out. Families are falling apart under the strain. But God presents the Sabbath as a much better way to live the good life.<br>
Let’s look at some of the specific benefits of Sabbath-rest:<br>
(1) The Sabbath is a memorial of creation, and by keeping it holy, we erect a memorial to our Creator. Its sacred hours offer a wonderful opportunity to get in touch with our roots on God’s created world. When was the last time you or your family took time to really soak in the quiet beauty of a forest path or rocky stream? The Sabbath gives us time to spend with Jesus and catch glimpse of the wonders He has made for us.<br>
(2) On the Sabbath we experience the joy of worship and fellowship with other Christians. There’s a benefit from praising God with others as a group of worshipers. The Sabbath gives us that special time of coming together as a church body to recharge our spiritual batteries.<br>
(3) The Sabbath provides occasions to perform thoughtful acts of kindness. Has a neighbor been sick during the week when you had no time to visit? When a friend needed a sympathetic ear after her husband’s death, did the pressure of daily living deprive her of your loving attention? Jesus advised: “It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:12).<br>
(4) The Sabbath is a day to strengthen family ties. Then Christ commanded, “On [the Sabbath] you shall not do any work” (Exodus 20:10). He couldn’t have given a better prescription to workaholic dads and stressed-out moms. The Sabbath is a giant STOP sign for families. Stop letting the most urgent things crowd out the most important things. The Sabbath is one day when we can replace pressure with prayer, labor with laughter, busy schedules with quiet reflection. Sabbath-rest provides the entire family with time to link up with Christ and tap into His spiritual energy.<br>
(5) The Sabbath is a time when Jesus comes especially near. Every relationship needs quality time, and our relationship with Christ is no exception. Devoting a whole day to Christ each week is a great way to keep our friendship with Him fresh and exciting. The Sabbath gives us extra time for Bible study and prayer, extra time to simply be alone with Christ in a quiet place and listen.<br>
Jesus “blessed the seventh day and made it holy” with the promise of His presence (Genesis 2:3). You can understand why it is important to observe Saturday, the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, because it is the day Christ set apart at creation to communicate with us in a special way.<br>
When Jesus created the Sabbath it almost seems that He had our generation in mind. It’s exactly what we need in our stress-filled environment: a day that is truly a complete break from everything else. A day to worship God, get in touch with creation again, and concentrate on relationships instead of things.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
We can sum up the benefits of linking up with Jesus through a daily and a weekly encounter in one word-rest. The word “Sabbath” comes from a Hebrew word that means rest, so it’s not surprising that the Scripture calls the seventh day “a Sabbath of rest” (Leviticus 23:3).<br>
“[God] has spoken about the seventh day in these words: ‘And on the seventh day God rested from all his work’…. THERE REMAINS, THEN, A SABBATH-REST FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD;…Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest.”-Hebrews 4:4-11.<br>
Experiencing “Sabbath-rest” gives us a weekly foretaste of the joy we will experience in the perfect rest of heaven. This rest isn’t just inactivity, it refers to the sense of security, peace and well-being that lie at the root of the truly abundant life. This kind of spiritual rest can be appreciated only through experience. The testimony of those who have experienced salvation-rest and Sabbath-rest is universal: “If you enter into the rest of Jesus through a daily and weekly connection with Him, you will discover the greatest joy in life.”<br>
Would you like to thank Jesus for His gift of rest? Would you like to thank Him for the promise of salvation-rest each day to meet the challenges of life, and for the promise of Sabbath-rest each week to cement your relationship with Him? If you have never done so, would you like to accept the salvation He offers? Would you like to tell Him you desire to keep His Sabbath each week? Would you like to say, “Yes Lord! I desire to find delight in the day you have established.” Why not make that commitment right now?<br>
[You may be wondering: Who changed the Sabbath from Saturday, the seventh day of the week, to Sunday, the first day of the week? When was the change made? Did God authorize the change? These questions will be answered in Guide 21.]<br>

Larry was enjoying pleasant conversation, Japanese tea, and rice crackers at Mr. Komori’s house when the other guests began taking out their Bibles. They all looked at him expectantly. “Could you please give us our study now?” Mr. Komori asked.<br>
Larry almost choked on his tea. He’d thought this get-together was just to have fun. And now he couldn’t think of a thing to say.<br>
Larry had actually taught many Bible classes at the Christian English language school in Japan where he worked. But they were all well-planned. He could give out information on the Bible with ease. But to just talk about God spontaneously… that was different.<br>
Larry had heard all the Bible stories since childhood. But they meant very little to him on a personal basis. He’d been doing things He knew were wrong in God’s eyes. How could he talk to others about a God he himself didn’t really know?<br>
Now, sitting there on the sofa, surrounded by expectant people, his charade was about to collapse. In that moment of fear, a verse flashed into his mind about the Holy Spirit giving us words to say when we are brought before people to give witness (Luke 12:12). He uttered a desperate prayer for help and latched onto the most familiar story he could think of: the Prodigal Son.<br>
As he described how much God loves even those who wander away from Him, Larry found himself speaking straight from the heart. His words were sinking in. For the first time in his life Larry realized how much God loved him.<br>
That night Larry knelt by his bed and committed his life to a God who’d finally become real. Sharing God’s love had made it much more than just a familiar abstraction. It was now a fact that overwhelmed him.<br>

The disciples had spent three and a half years taking in Christ’s words and actions, and finally His death and resurrection. As Jesus was about to return to heaven, He commissioned the disciples to be His personal representatives:<br>
“YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and YOU WILL BE MY WITNESSES… to the ends of the earth.”-Acts 1:8. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
When Christ’s followers gave their heart unreservedly to Him at Pentecost, the risen Christ transformed their lives through the power of the Spirit. They became witnesses, not only to Christ’s bodily resurrection and ascension, but also to His resurrection power that had changed their lives.<br>
As Christian we too are witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus because we have experienced His renewing power in our own lives.<br>
“But because of his great love for us, GOD, who is rich in mercy, MADE US ALIVE WITH CHRIST even WHEN WE WERE DEAD IN TRANSGRESSIONS-it is by grace you have been saved. AND GOD RAISED US UP WITH CHRIST… IN ORDER THAT… HE MIGHT SHOW THE INCOMPARABLE RICHES OF HIS GRACE, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.”-Ephesians 2:4-7.<br>
We have been made alive with Christ, so we can “show the incomparable riches of His grace.” And He asks us to take the good news of what He can do in a human life to all the world, then promises to go with us as we do so (Matthew 28:19-20).<br>
H.M.S. Richards, the founder of the Voice of Prophecy radio ministry, once testified: “I have seen the change in the hearts of people who have heard the gospel of Christ. I have traveled in lands where the name of God and of Christ was never known until His church took the gospel there. I have seen these people changed from filth to cleanliness, from disease to health, from constant fear of evil spirits to joy in Christian living. I have seen the change in the status of womanhood. I have seen true Christian homes emerge from pagan darkness. In every land that I have visited I have seen lives changed. I know that ‘the gospel of Christ… is the power of God unto salvation’ (Romans 1:16). I know that when the church proclaims the gospel message, changes take place in human hearts and in human homes, and they are visible in the lives of those who respond to its appeal.”<br>
God has given to us weak human beings a special part to play in this exciting work, because sharing is a vital part of our growth. In order for our faith to remain healthy, it must be expressed. As Larry discovered so dramatically, sharing our faith helps us experience it more fully, and caused us to grow.<br>

A young man who’d grown up in an abusive home once observed: “I looked at my parents who by their example gave me a distorted image of a God; I never had the example of someone with skin on who loves me.” People around us desperately need someone who will give them a healthy picture of God. They need someone “with skin on” who will demonstrate godly qualities. Our most powerful sermon is often simply the way we live. Before a person cares how much you know, they must know how much you care. Peter urges us<br>
“LIVE SUCH GOOD LIVES among the pagans [non-Christian] that… THEY MAY SEE YOUR GOOD DEEDS AND GLORIFY GOD…. because CHRIST SUFFERED FOR YOU, LEAVING YOU AN EXAMPLE, THAT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS-1 Peter 2:12, 21.<br>
Since “Christ suffered” for us at Calvary, we have an example of sacrificial love very close at hand. That love, reproduced in us as loving acts to others, can become a powerful force drawing unbelievers into the arms of Christ.<br>

When the Devil ambushed Jesus in the wilderness with his appeals to appetite, pride, and presumption, Jesus fought back successfully by quoting from Scripture (Mathew 4:4, 7, 10). Christ was prepared because He had filled His mind with Bible truths. That’s where the battle is won or lost-in our minds.<br>
“For as [a person] thinketh in his heart, so is he.”-Proverbs 23:7, KJV.<br>
Growing Christians think heavenward. They concentrate on the healthy qualities they are trying to acquire.<br>
“Rejoice in the Lord always,… in everything, BY PRAYER and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will GUARD YOUR HEARTS AND YOUR MINDS in Christ Jesus. Finally, my brothers, whatever is TRUE, whatever is NOBLE, whatever is RIGHT, whatever is PURE, whatever is LOVELY, whatever is ADMIRABLE-if anything is EXCELLENT or PRAISEWORTHY-think about such things…. And the God of peace will be with you.”-Philippians 4:4-9.<br>
What we feed our minds makes all the difference. Garbage in, garbage out. God’s Word in, God’s life out.<br>

As a representative of Christ, the Christian will be modest even about how he or she looks, avoiding all kinds of extremes.<br>
“If any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over… when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. Instead, it should be that of your inner self, THE UNFADING BEAUTY OF A GENTLE AND QUIET SPIRIT, which is of great worth in God’s sight. For this is the way… [those] who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful.”-1 Peter 3:1-5.<br>
Simplicity in dress and adornment has always marked genuine Christ-likeness. Ideally, others should be attracted to us as Christians not by the statement we make about fashion, but by the statement our lives make about Jesus.<br>

The historian Edward Gibbon tells us that when Galerius sacked the camp of the Persians, a shining leather bag filled with pearls fell into the hands of a looting soldier. This man carefully preserved the useful bag, but threw away the precious pearls.<br>
People who cling to the superficial thrills the world can offer up-while discarding Jesus, the Pearl of Great Price- are in even worse shape than the looting soldier. It’s not just a fortune that can slip through our hands, but eternal salvation. So Scripture warns us:<br>
“Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything in the world-the cravings of sinful man [appetite], the lust of his eyes [love of the world], and the boasting of what he has and does [pride]-comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.”-1 John 2:15-17.<br>
Satan works hard to gold-plate the most destructive sins and the worst habits. Advertising for alcoholic drinks shows only young, beautiful, hard-working, intensely happy people. We never see anyone who resembles a pathetic figure stumbling out of the liquor store with a paper sack in their hands. <br>
We have to be careful of associations that compromise our Christian principles (2 Corinthians 6:14). Christ does, of course, want us to keep reaching out to non-Christian friends. Personal relationships are the primary means through which faith is shared. Just make sure that your associates are not dragging you back into the old way of life.<br>
What we take into our lives, even the entertainment we choose, has an impact on our spiritual life. We need to be conscious of what we’re feeding our minds. <br>
“I will set before my eyes no vile thing.”-Psalm 101:3.<br>
If we feed our souls on the best, the worst won’t be able to drag us down to its level. Holding to higher standards in the things we let into our homes and minds won’t narrow our lives. The Christian has more to make him happy than anyone else.<br>
“YOU WILL FILL ME WITH JOY in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.”-Psalm 16:11.<br>

As he was about to baptize a new believer, the late Pastor H.M.S. Richards noticed that the man still had a well-filled billfold in his pocket. Richards asked if he’d forgotten to leave his money in the dressing room. “My pocketbook and I will be baptized together,” the man explained. He had caught the true spirit of Christianity-giving to help others. Christians grow by giving, and that is why “Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive’” (Acts 20:35).<br>
What we give to advance God’s kingdom retains an eternal value.<br>
“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But STORE UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES IN HEAVEN…. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”-Matthew 6:19-21.<br>
As you give, remember: “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it” (Psalm 24:1), including the silver and gold (Haggai 2:8). We ourselves belong to God, because He created us and because He rescued us from our sins by paying the price for our sins with His blood (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Everything we own belongs to God, because He gives us “the ability to produce wealth” (Deuteronomy 8:18).<br>
How much does our crucified and risen Lord invite us to share with Him for giving the gospel to others?<br>
“Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me. But you ask, ‘How do we rob you?’ ‘IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS…. Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,’ says the LORD Almighty, ‘and see if I WILL not THROW OPEN THE FLOODGATES OF HEAVEN and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.’”-Malachi 3:8-10.<br>
Tithe is a “tenth” of our “increase” (Deuteronomy 14:22, KJV; Genesis 28:22). For the farmer or merchant the increase is income after deducting business expenses. For the employee, it is the total wage. The principle of tithing is a moral principle because it involves character. By failing to tithe we “rob” God. The tithe belongs to God and is to be used exclusively for supporting Christ’s ministry (1 Corinthians 9:14), and finishing His work on earth so He can return (Matthew 24:14).<br>
When Jesus came to live among us, He gave approval to tithing in New Testament times (Matthew 23:23).<br>
How much should we give in offerings? Offerings are a matter of individual decision. Each person “should give what he has decided in his heart to give” (2 Corinthians 9:5-7). You can’t outgive God:<br>
“Give and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap.”-Luke 6:38.<br>
H.M.S Richards once related this experience:<br>
“A lifelong gambler attended my meetings in Los Angeles, and I shall never forget the time I talked with him alone in the rear of the auditorium. He took a roll of bills from his pocked, $500, and gave them all to me, saying, ‘This is my first tithe.’<br>
“The man was not well, and he had done nothing but gamble for 30 or 40 years, so I said, ‘How are you going to live?’<br>
He replied, ‘I have only five or six dollars left, but this other belongs to God.’<br>
Then I asked, ‘What will you do?’<br>
“I don’t know,’ he answered, ‘but I know that I must pay my tithe to God, and He will take care of me.’<br>
“And God certainly did. The man’s repentance was sincere. He went all the way in his consecration and was happy in his Christian life. And God provided for him to the day of his death.” God does not promise that all faithful believers will grow rich. But we have the assurance that our Maker will supply life’s necessities.<br>
Christ gave everything for us. Let’s give our hearts completely to Him now. Let’s share Christ with others by the way we live, think, look, act, and give. Why not discover the joy of sharing Christ with others and of growing in His wonderful grace?<br>

Contemporary researchers have taken pains to document a truth which the Bible first established: human beings are an integrated whole. What we often divide into the physical, mental, and spiritual parts of a person are really interrelated and inseparable. In other words, what affects the mind, affects the body. Our spiritual condition has an impact on our physical condition, and vice versa. We are a whole person.<br>
For example, scientific researchers have found in controlled studies that happy, joyful laughter produces measurable changes in a person’s immune system. You can actually help your body fight diseases better by being happy! These studies show how closely the mind and body work together.<br>
Thousand of years ago God’s Word pointed out this vital connection between the mind and the body which has only recently been accepted into medical theory:<br>
“A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.”-Proverbs 17:22. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
According to the apostle John, how closely related are the mind and body to our spiritual well being?<br>
“Dear friend, I pray that you may ENJOY GOOD HEALTH and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.”-3 John 2.<br>
Our Creator wants us to “enjoy good health.” The Word of God can serve as our fountain of health, as well as our fountain of eternal life.<br>
Since physical and mental health and our spiritual well-being go hand-in-hand, Paul makes the following appeal:<br>
“Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.”-1 Corinthians 10:31.<br>
The gospel includes both physical and spiritual restoration. A healthful lifestyle can help us be vibrant Christians.<br>
Here are eight principles to follow if you really want to live a healthier and more productive life:<br>

Pure, fresh air is essential to good health. During the day and while sleeping at night, proper ventilation of our home and workplace insures that our blood will always distribute enough oxygen to every part of the body. Taking deep breaths during a morning walk is a great way to oxygenate your body. <br>
The kind of air we breathe is obviously important. Be careful not to subject yourself to fumes, gases or air-borne bacteria from some hidden source. Smoking pollutes the air and is one of today’s big killers. Scientific research has established a causal relationship between tobacco and lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. The body’s addiction to the nicotine in cigarettes makes smoking one of the hardest habits to break. Smoking will kill 12 million people a year by the year 2020 if the present trend continues.<br>

“The benefits of sunlight are many:<br>
“1. Fifteen to 30 minutes of daily exposure to sunlight in the early morning or late afternoon helps the body synthesize of make its own vitamin D, an essential nutrient/hormone in the skin. Vitamin D helps blood to produce calcium and phosphorous, which build and repair bone mass.<br>
“2. Sunlight acts as a disinfectant and a killer of bacteria.<br>
“3. The sun provides energy by which the plant kingdom can convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates…. Without this process animals and humans would starve to death.<br>
“4. Sunlight also helps a person adjust to night work and relieves depression related to dark days where winter occurs. <br>
“A word of caution: Sunlight can also be harmful. Prolonged exposure can burn skin, increase the risk of skin cancer, speed up the aging process, damage the eyes, and cause cataracts.” [All quotations in this Guide are from Look Up and Live: A Guide to Health, Adult Lessons, First Quarter 1993, (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press Publishing Association).

The body must have rest in order to repair itself. We must have time for recreation and rest to relieve the tensions of work and family responsibilities. Without their required dosage of rest, people often experience anxiety, depression, and irritability. Such emotional stress can lead to illness, which will force us to take the rest our bodies were asking for all along. There’s simply no substitute for a good night’s sleep.<br>
Recharging our spiritual batteries on a daily basis is also important to physical health. A Christian’s daily time of meditation, Bible study, and prayer will heal the body as well as the soul. We also need a regular break from the work cycle, a weekly day of rest, and annual or semi-annual vacations.<br>

Exercise is vital to our health:<br>
“1. Exercise helps to normalize blood pressure.<br>
“2. Exercise allows more blood to reach all pars of the body, keeping the extremities warm. <br>
“3. Exercise releases both physical and emotional tension, helping you to feel better about life. Exercise is usually the best cure for worry and stress.<br>
“4. Exercise provides electrical energy to the brain and nerve cells. It promotes health by stimulating the immune system. When the body is kept in tone by proper exercise, the mind thinks more creatively and efficiently<br>
“5. It can help with your complexion and keep you trim.<br>
“6. Exercise makes you more energetic, thus delaying both physical and emotional fatigue.<br>
“7. It aids in the brain’s production of a chemical that gives you a sense of well-being and increases your tolerance for pain.”<br>
If you have not been exercising, start slowly and increase gradually as you gain endurance. It may be wise to consult your physician before starting. Your goal should be to engage in any type of exercise that is comparable to walking one mile in 15 minutes four or more times a week.<br>

Since water is essential to every cell in the body, we should drink plenty of it.<br>
“1. By weight the body is about 70 percent of water….<br>
“2. The body requires about two and one half quarts of water per day to perform all of its functions. Some of these functions include blood circulation, waste removal, nutrient transport, and digestion….<br>
“3. The average person has between 15 and 40 million brain cells. Each one of those is 70 to 85 percent water. Sufficient water to supply these cells helps keep you mentally alert and helps prevent depression and irritability.<br>
“4. It is not only the water you drink is important. A cool or tepid daily bath or shower improves circulation, thus energizing the body and mind. A shower or bath can also soothe jangled nerves, which can cause illness by weakening the immune system. Bathing also removes impurities from the skin and can reduce fever.”<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
At creation God instructed Adam and Eve to eat a diet of nuts, grains, and fruits (Genesis 1:29). After Adam and Eve sinned, vegetables were added to their diet (Genesis 3:18). After the flood, the Creator added “clean” flesh foods to the diet (Genesis 7:2-3, 9:1-6).<br>
The flesh of animals contains both saturated fat and cholesterol, which increase the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. Today many physicians advise those who eat meat to consume only lean, well-cooked meat and fish and to do so sparingly.<br>
Because people on a vegetarian diet are healthier and live longer, many experts in nutrition and health urge us to consider returning to humanity’s original diet of nuts, grains, and fruits with vegetables added.<br>
If you’d like to start a vegetarian menu, make sure you first understand how to provide a balanced diet without meat. Eat five or six servings a day of a variety of fruits, nuts, grains, legumes, and vegetables. Green and yellow vegetables, along with citrus fruits, are especially important. Use whole grain cereal flour, and use brown rice instead of white. Your intake of starches and complex carbohydrates should consist of six or more servings a day. Replace your intake of animal fats (butter, cream, lard, suet, etc.) with vegetable fats. The above diet is adequate without meat if you use dairy products.<br>
Those who choose to eat meat as a part of their diet, should eat only the meats that the Bible indicates are “clean,” or fit for humans to eat. When God gave people permission to eat meat after the flood (Genesis 7:2-3, Leviticus 11:47), He defined which of the flesh foods were clean, and which were unclean and not fit to eat.<br>
Read in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 list of birds, beasts, and fish God pronounced unfit for food. According to these chapters, clean animals must divide, or split, the hoof and also chew the cud. Clean fish must have both scales and fins. Scavenger birds are forbidden.<br>
Among the unclean animals, swine are especially mentioned and condemned (Deuteronomy 14:8). A high percentage of human bodies autopsied are infected with trichinae. These tiny worms are transmitted to people who eat infected pork. Current scientific research increasingly reveals why God declared some flesh unclean. One reason may be the danger of disease, such as the trichina worm in pork. Another reason may be the devastating effects of saturated fat on the human digestive system.<br>

What warnings does the Bible give about alcoholic beverages?<br>
“Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise.”-Proverbs 20:1.<br>
“Nor thieves nor the greedy nor the DRUNKARDS nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”-1 Corinthians 6:10.<br>
Alcohol affects the following bodily systems:<br>
“1. The immune system- Alcohol decreases the white cells’ ability to fight disease, thus increasing the risk of pneumonia, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and several cancers.<br>
“2. The endocrine system- Only two or three alcoholic drinks per day increase the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature births.<br>
“3. The circulatory system- The use of alcohol increases the risk of coronary heart disease, reduces blood sugar, and elevates blood fats and blood pressure, thus increasing hypertension.<br>
“4. The digestive system- Alcohol irritates the stomach, thereby causing gastric bleeding…. Habitual use of alcohol raises the risk of fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis of the liver.”<br>
Alcohol is responsible for a large percentage of suicides, auto deaths, child abuse cases, and home violence.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
A person haunted by fear of guilt will find it hard to benefit fully from the health practices we’ve just described. But a person enjoying a positive faith in God will experience the ultimate source of well-being:<br>
“Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits-who forgives all your sins and HEALS ALL YOUR DISEASES, who REDEEMS YOUR LIFE from the pit.”-Psalm 103:2-4.<br>
David Larson, a consultant to the National Institute of Mental Health in the United States, did extensive research on the relationship between religion and health. His study demonstrated a direct connection between a Christian commitment and health. He was surprised to learn: Those who attend church live longer than those who don’t. Church-goers have a reduced incidence of heart attack, hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, and other diseases. Those who have faith in God live more productive lives because they are less likely to be depressed, to become alcoholics, to be jailed as repeat offenders, or to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Trust in divine power is the keystone to genuine well-being and a healthy and happy life.<br>
Approximately 50,000 Seventh-day Adventists were studied, primarily in California, over 30 years. Results showed that Adventist men live 8.9 years longer and women 7.5 years longer than the general population. Studies of Adventists in Holland, Norway, and Poland show similar results. Researchers attribute the longer life span of Adventists to their following some or all of the eight health principles outlined in this guide. Those who follow these principles not only have a longer life, but also a much better quality of life.<br>
Applying the Bible’s perspective to our lives does make a difference in all kinds of practical ways, offering convincing evidence that Christianity is the most practical, reasonable religion in all the world. It changes people-their thinking and their actions-and creates a new lifestyle.<br>
Because of the close relationship between the mind, the body, and our spiritual life, Christians who live by the Word of God will want to follow the principles of a healthful lifestyle as they prepare for Jesus’ second coming (1 John 3:1-3). Christ not only wants us to be ready to meet Him when He returns, He also wants to improve the quality of our present lives. We can cooperate with Him by following God’s basic health principles.<br>
Jesus promises to deliver us from every destructive habit through His “power at work within us” (Ephesians 3:20). If your are attempting to overcome some body-destroying habit such as using tobacco or drinking alcoholic beverages, your best resolutions to quit often turn to ropes of sand. But by tapping God’s power that is “at work within” you, God can give you strength to overcome. The Word of God promises: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).<br>

Here is a thrilling letter from one of our Bible school representatives in Africa:<br>
“Five years ago I received a request from the Voice of Prophecy to visit a prisoner who was a Bible correspondence school student. I presented the request to the prison authorities, who graciously gave permission. Because the student had a deep desire to study the Bible, I visited regularly.<br>
“About six months after my initial visit, he asked to be baptized and join the church. The authorities agreed to provide facilities so the baptism could take place in the prison. The wardens and other prisoners gathered to witness one of the most moving baptisms I have ever conducted.<br>
“Shortly after this, our brother was released from jail, even though he still had considerable time to serve. When I asked why, I was told that his life had changed so drastically, and he was such a witness for his Savior and his religion that he could no longer be thought of as a prisoner, nor be treated as such. This man was united with his family and is now a leader in one of our large congregations.”<br>

When this prisoner became a Christian and his life completely changed, why was it important for him to be baptized? In a conversation with Nicodemus, the community leader who came to Jesus by night, Jesus makes clear the importance and meaning of baptism:<br>
“No one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again… unless he is born of water and the Spirit.”-John 3:3, 5. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
So according to Jesus we must be born “of water and the Spirit.” “Born of the Spirit” signifies entering a new life by undergoing a change of mind and heart. Because entering the kingdom of God involves a completely new kind of existence, not just an old life patched up, it is called the new birth. Water baptism is the outward symbolic portrayal of this inward change. Our representative baptized the prisoner as a recognition of his commitment to Christ an as a symbol of the transformation the Holy Spirit had begun in his character.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Our salvation revolves around three of Christ’s great acts:<br>
“Christ DIED for our sins according to the Scriptures,… he was BURIED,… he was RAISED on the third day according to the Scriptures.”-1 Corinthians 15:3, 4.<br>
Christ made salvation possible through His death, burial, and resurrection.<br>
“Don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were BAPTIZED INTO HIS DEATH? We were therefore BURIED WITH HIM THROUGH BAPTISM into death in order that, JUST AS CHRIST WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD through the glory of the Father, WE TOO MAY LIVE A NEW LIFE.”-Romans 6:3, 4. <br>
Christ died for our sins, was buried, then rose from the grave to give us a new life of righteousness. By being baptized we actually participate in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Baptism means that we have died to sin with Christ, buried the old life of sin with Christ, and we are rising to “live a new life” in Christ. Christ’s death and resurrection becomes our death and resurrection. God can make us dead to sin, as if we’d been crucified. He can make us alive to the things of the Spirit, as if we’d been resurrected from the dead. <br>
The physical act of baptism graphically represents the steps of conversion. First, we’re lowered into the water, we’re immersed completely, just as people who have died are lowered into the grave and covered. This says we are willing to die with Christ and bury our old lifestyle. Baptism is a funeral, a formal farewell to an existence in which sin dominated. Then, we’re lifted up out of the water by the one baptizing, just like a person being resurrected from the grave. This says that we’re a “new creation,” entirely given to the “new life” God gives us.<br>
Only immersion can accurately illustrate the true meaning of baptism-death, burial, and rebirth. “Baptism” by sprinkling doesn’t adequately symbolize the new birth.<br>
What does it really mean to die with Christ?<br>
“For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with [be rendered powerless, margin] that we should no longer be slaves to sin.”-Romans 6:6.<br>
Baptism represents outwardly what a person must do inside: surrender everything to Christ. If we hold anything back from God, then we’ll likely remain “slaves to sin.” When we surrender fully to Christ, our sinful desires are “rendered powerless,” and our transformation begins.<br>
Who is responsible for the change that takes place?<br>
“I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but CHRIST LIVES IN ME. The life I live in the body, I LIVE BY FAITH IN THE SON OF GOD, who loved me and gave himself for me.”-Galatians 2:20.<br>
When I identify with Christ’s crucifixion through baptism, I invite a powerful force into my life-“Christ lives in me.”<br>
In order to put your life fully in Christ’s hands, first look at Christ dying on the cross. Don’t look at the sin that’s threatening you, don’t look at your past record and moan; look to Jesus. Viewing Christ’s gracious and courageous death at Calvary, you can express solidarity with Him: “By the power of the cross I claim that I am dead to old habits and responsive to God. I make my stand with Christ. From now on I will ‘live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.’”<br>
As we tap into the power of Christ’s death and resurrection we see more and more of His good qualities replacing our old habits:<br>
“If anyone is IN CHRIST, he is a NEW CREATION; the OLD has gone, the NEW has come!”-2 Corinthians 5:17.<br>
Through baptism we express our desire to lock arms with Jesus and live a new and better life “in Christ.” Jesus does in us what we could never do for ourselves. We arise from the water “a new creation”; He gives us the power to live a “new” life.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
At Pentecost, Peter told those who were seeking release from guilt to “repent and be baptized” so Christ can forgive “your sins” (Acts 2:38). Since Jesus never committed a single sin, Why did He permit Himself to be baptized?<br>
“Then JESUS CAME from Galilee TO THE JORDAN TO BE BAPTIZED by John… TO FULFILL ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS.”-Matthew 3:13, 15.<br>
Jesus was sinless. He didn’t need to repent of any sin. He was baptized for another reason: “to fulfill all righteousness.” By being baptized, Jesus set a positive example for us weak, sinful human beings. Christ never asks His followers to go anywhere He hasn’t been. So when believers are immersed in the waters of baptism, they are following in the steps of the Master.<br>
Because Christ died for our sins, He can give us His righteousness. <br>
“God made him who has no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”-2 Corinthians 5:21.<br>
Transformed in God’s eyes from sinners into saints, we grow into that “righteousness,” and thus we live a new life in Christ.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Christ was immersed at His baptism; He was not sprinkled with water. John baptized Him in the Jordan River “because there was PLENTY OF WATER” (John 3:23). When Jesus was baptized, He went down into the water, and “as soon as Jesus was baptized [immersed, Greek], he went UP OUT OF THE WATER” (Matthew 3:16). <br>
When we understand the true meaning of baptism, we have little difficulty recognizing the authentic form of baptism. The very word “baptize” comes from the Greek word baptizo, and means to dip or immerse (put under).<br>
During John Wesley’s visit to America in 1737, a church jury of 34 men tried him on the strange charge of “refusing to baptize Mr. Parker’s child, except by dipping.” It’s evident that the father of Methodism baptized his converts by immersion.<br>
The reformer John Calvin stated: “It is certain that immersion was the practice of the ancient Church.”-Institute of the Christian Religion, Bk. 4, Chap. 15, Sec. 19.<br>
The history of the early church makes clear that baptism meant immersion. Dean Stanly, of the Church of England, wrote: “For the first thirteen centuries, the almost universal practice of baptism was that of which we read in the New Testament, and which is the very meaning of the word ‘baptize’-that those who were baptized were plunged, submerged, immersed into the water.”-Christian Institutions, p.21.<br>
Baptisteries for immersing converts appear in many of the churches which were built between the fourth and fourteenth centuries in Europe and Asia, churches like cathedral in Pisa, Italy, and St. John’s, the largest church in Rome.<br>
It was not until the Council of Ravenna early in the fifteenth century that the Catholic Church accepted sprinkling as equally valid with immersion. In questions of church practice, we are not to follow what a man teaches, but what Christ and His apostles teach.<br>
Many sincere Christians cherish the tradition of infant baptism, and giving our children to God from the very beginning is certainly commendable. The Bible, however, makes it clear that a person must be taught the way of salvation before baptism (Matthew 28:19, 20), that a person must believe in Jesus before being baptized (Acts 8:35-38), and that a person must repent of sin and be forgiven before being baptized (Acts 2:38). A baby is incapable of believing, repentance, or confession, which must precede baptism.<br>

According to Jesus, baptism is essential for those who wish to enter heaven:<br>
“No one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.”-John 3:5.<br>
Jesus gives only one exception. The thief on the cross was “born of the Spirit,” even though it was impossible for him to leave the cross and be immersed in water as a sign of his change of heart. And Jesus promised him that he would be with Him in the kingdom (Luke 23:42, 43). For the thief, being “born of water and of the Spirit” represents the blood of Jesus which was being spilt to cleanse him from his sins. Augustine observed, “There is one case of deathbed repentance recorded, that of the penitent thief, that none should despair; and only one, that none should presume.”<br>
Jesus Himself gave this solemn warning:<br>
“Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe [and therefore is not baptized] will be condemned.”-Mark 16:16.<br>
By dying in our place at Calvary, Jesus made a public demonstration of His love for us. We need to respond with a public, unashamed confession of our commitment to Christ through baptism. Have you begun a new life in Christ? Have you been baptized? If not, why not prepare for baptism in the near future?<br>

Baptism represents our commitment to a Christian lifestyle. But our surrender at baptism doesn’t automatically last a lifetime.<br>
When a child is born, a celebration is in order. After the day of birth is over and the excitement subsides, the baby requires daily feeding, daily bathing, and daily concern for its welfare. It’s much the same with baptism. Paul said of his experience, “I die every day” (1 Corinthians 15:31). By daily turning from selfishness, we become more and more responsive to Christ.<br>
The rite of baptism, like the wedding ceremony, was meant to be the formal confirmation that a wonderful and growing relationship has begun. In order to grow consistently, we need a daily giving of ourselves to Christ, a daily reception of a new life through prayer and Bible study.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Baptism is cause for great rejoicing because those who place their faith in Christ have the assurance of eternal life. “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved” (Mark 16:16). When we are baptized, we’re on an upward path leading us to eternal joy.<br>
Baptism also celebrates a present happiness with Christ. He promises the priceless gift of the Holy Spirit to those baptized (Acts 2:38). With the Spirit comes “the fruit of the Spirit”-“love,” which fills the life with “patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control” (Galatians 5:22, 23).<br>
Having Jesus living inside us by His Holy Spirit gives a profound sense of certainty.<br>
For “the Spirit Himself testifies… that we are God’s children” (Romans 8:15, 16).<br>
This secure relationship with God brings us many benefits, but is doesn’t guarantee a problem-free life. In fact, the enemy often tries to throw the most difficulties at those who’ve just made a commitment to Christ. However, when we’re in God’s hands we can know that He will use everything that happens to us, good and bad, to teach us and help us grow (see Romans 8:28).<br>
A young woman made a decision to commit her life to Christ and be baptized, in spite of her husband’s threat of divorce. He wanted no part of her new faith, but she stuck to Jesus and tried to become a more loving wife than ever before. For some time the husband made things difficult at home. But finally he was won over by and argument he couldn’t answer: her transformed life. This man surrendered his life to Christ and he too was baptized.<br>
Sticking close to Christ through “thick and thin” will make us powerful instruments in His hands. We can commit our lives to Him unconditionally because He has already made the ultimate commitment to us when He paid the price for our sins on the cross. What a privilege it is to publicly give Him our love and allegiance! If you haven’t yet done so, why not surrender your life to Christ right now. Ask Him to create a new life in you by the Holy Spirit, and then be baptized into Christ.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
In the early 1960s, Brother Andrew, a man from Holland, smuggled a load of Bibles in his VW across the Romanian border and past communist guards. He checked into a hotel and began praying that God would lead him to the right Christian groups-the ones who could best use his copies of the Scriptures.<br>
That weekend Andrew walked up to the hotel clerk and asked where he might find a church. <br>
The clerk looked at him a little strangely and answered, “We don’t have many of those, you know. Besides you couldn’t understand the language.”<br>
“Didn’t you know?” Andrew replied, “Christians speak a kind of universal language.”<br>
“Oh, what’s that?”<br>
“It’s called Agape.”<br>
The clerk had never heard of it, but Andrew assured him, “It’s the most beautiful language in the world.”<br>
Andrew was able to locate several church groups in the area and managed to arrange a meeting with the president and secretary of a certain denomination. Unfortunately, although both Andrew and these men knew several European languages, they found they had none in common. So there they sat staring at each other. Andrew had traveled many dangerous miles with his precious cargo, but there seemed no way of telling whether these men were genuine Christian brothers or government informants.<br>
Finally he spotted a Romanian Bible on a desk in the office. Andrew reached into his pocket and pulled out a Dutch Bible. He turned to 1 Corinthians 16:20 and held the Bible out, pointing to the name of the book, which they could recognize. Instantly their faces lit up. They quickly found the same chapter and verse in their Romanian Bibles and read: “All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.”<br>
The men beamed back at Andrew. Then one of them looked through his Bible and found Proverbs 25:25. Andrew found the verse and read: “Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land.”<br>
These men spent half an hour conversing and sharing-just through the words of Scripture. They were so happy in this fellowship that crossed all cultural boundaries that they laughed until tears came to their eyes.<br>
Andrew knew he had found his brothers. When he showed them his load of Bibles, the Romanians were overwhelmed and embraced him again and again.<br>
That evening at the hotel, the clerk approached Andrew and remarked, “Say, I looked up ‘agape’ in the dictionary. There’s no language by that name. That’s just a Greek word for love.”<br>
Andrew replied, “That’s it. I was speaking in it all afternoon.”<br>

Jesus established the church in order to meet the basic human requirement of nurture and support. We all have needs. And that’s what the church is all about. It’s a place where we come to fellowship and help each other. Scripture reveals a dynamic apostolic church which called men and women into a joyful fellowship that extended all the way up to the Almighty:<br>
“We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have FELLOWSHIP WITH US. And OUR FELLOWSHIP IS WITH THE FATHER AND WITH HIS SON, Jesus Christ. We write this to make our JOY COMPLETE.”-1 John 1:3, 4. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
A community of hearts bonded through contact with Jesus and with one another, experience “joy” to the fullest! They’re all speaking the same language, the language of love.<br>
Christians become part of an extended family. They become brothers and sisters in Christ since all have a kindred spirit. The broader the unity of belief, the stronger the ties among Christians.<br>
The members of the churches established by Jesus’ apostles were bound together by their similar beliefs, their love of God, and their desire to serve Him and share His grace to the world. This close bond of fellowship was one of the reasons this powerless and persecuted minority turned the world upside down.<br>

Does Christ have a church, or is the whole idea of religious organization just a human invention? Jesus answers:<br>
“On this ROCK I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.”-Matthew 16:18, margin.<br>
Jesus is the anchoring Rock, the Cornerstone, of His church.<br>
What group formed a part of the foundation?<br>
“Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone.”-Ephesians 2:20.<br>
What did the Lord accomplish when the gospel was preached?<br>
“And the Lord added to the CHURCH daily such as should be saved.”-Acts 2:47, KJV.<br>
When Jesus established the church, He promised that “the gates of hell will not overcome it” (Matthew 16:18), and the Christian church still endures. It has had extremely powerful enemies-from Roman emperors to communist dictators-but the blood of martyrs has only caused it to grow stronger. When one Christian was burned at the stake or tossed to the lions, several others sprang up to take his or her place. Skeptics have done their best to reason the Christian Church away. But Christian truth competes more eloquently than ever in a scientific, secular age. <br>
One of the church’s greatest challenges came soon after its acceptance as the official religion of the Roman Empire. The church grew prosperous-and eventually was corrupted. It seemed spiritually dead in the Dark Ages. But the Lord always preserved a core of courageous and faithful believers who, in the bleak and difficult times, shone bright as stars on a moonless night.<br>
Paul compares Christ’s relationship to His church to a husband’s tender, protective relationship to His wife (Ephesians 5:23-25). The church is a family, with each member establishing relationships to the other members of the family and contributing to their well-being (Ephesians 2:19).<br>
Paul also represents the church as a living body, with Christ Himself as its head (Colossians 1:18).<br>
When we are baptized, we testify to our faith in Jesus and become members of the “body,” the church.<br>
“For we are all BAPTIZED by one Spirit INTO ONE BODY.”-1 Corinthians 12:13.<br>
The book of Revelation pictures the risen Christ walking among the churches, showing His care over them (Revelation 1:20, 12, 13). Christ has never forsaken His people, and He never will.<br>

Church attendance is vital for a Christian. We need the support of others to keep our faith alive and growing.<br>
The church also plays three other important roles:<br>
(1)The church guards the truth.<br>
As the “pillar and foundation of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15), the church upholds and defends God’s truth before the world. We need the collective wisdom of other believers to help us focus on the essential truths of Scripture.<br>
(2)The church is an example of what God’s grace can do for sinners. The changes that Christ has made in the lives of believers give acclaim to the God who calls us “into his wonderful light” (1 Peter 2:9).<br>
(3)God’s people are His witnesses to a needy world. Just before He returned to heaven, Jesus promised His disciples:<br>
“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”-Acts 1:8.<br>
It is a great privilege for the church to take the message of God’s tremendous love worldwide.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The church that Christ established has a definite organization. One could be included in, or excluded from, its membership (Matthew 18:15-18). God’s church appointed leaders and had a world headquarters as well as local meeting places (Acts 8:14; 14:23; 15:2; 1Timothy 3:1-13). When they were baptized, believers joined an organized group. (Acts 2:41 and 47).<br>
The church exists for mutual encouragement.<br>
“And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but LET US ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER-and all the more as you see the Day [of Christ’s coming] approaching.”-Hebrews 10:24, 25. <br>
This is, in a nutshell, what a healthy church group does. Its members build each other up in the faith, they encourage one another. God organized His church to strengthen God’s people and also to serve the world. We can do far more together than we can as isolated individuals. Take just one example: Seventh-day Adventist Church. We carry on an extensive medical work around the world-from inner-city health vans to clinics in remote islands of the South Pacific. Our educational institutions have brought tens of thousands of youth to a knowledge of a better life in Christ-from Loma Linda University, pioneering in heart transplants, to tiny mission schools scattered through the African interior. We carry on famine and disaster relief through ADRA. Local churches help clothe and feed the poor and homeless at thousands of Community Service Centers. And groups of Adventists believers are sharing the message of salvation in more than 200 countries. Only an organized group of dedicated Christian could have this worldwide impact.<br>
Christ and the apostles compared the church to a body, and pointed out that all parts of the body are needed (1 Corinthians 12:21-28). All body parts are not exactly alike, yet all are important and all must work together in harmony. An eye separated from the body can’t see. A hand cut off has no value. Whether we are an eye, a hand, or only a finger, we can’t be truly effective for Christ totally on our own. Belonging to a church, being united to the other members of the body, strengthens us as Christians.<br>

Deep in our hearts lies a longing to worship God, and that need can wither away unless given expression. How did the psalmist feel when he thought about going to a place of worship?<br>
“I REJOICED with those who said to me, ‘Let us go to the house of the LORD.”-Psalm 122:1.<br>
What part does music have in public worship?<br>
“Worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs.”-Psalm 100:2.<br>
The Bible tells us that giving offerings is an appropriate part of divine worship.<br>
“Bring an offering and come into his courts. Worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.”-Psalm 96:8-9.<br>
Prayer is also a vital aspect of public worship.<br>
“Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.”-Psalm 95:6.<br>
Bible study and preaching are central to New Testament worship. Beginning with Peter’s sermon on the day of Pentecost, found in Acts 2, and from the time of the Protestant Reformers to our day, every great religious revival has been based on biblical preaching. Why? Because “the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword” (Hebrews 4:12-13).<br>

Some object that the church is full of imperfect people. What Henry Ward Beecher said is true: “The church is not a gallery for the exhibition of eminent Christians, but a school for the education of imperfect ones.”<br>
Since none of us is perfect, the church will never be perfect either. In one of His parables Jesus reminded us that weeds grow among the wheat (Matthew 13:24-30). When we read the New Testament letters of Paul, we discover that the apostolic church had critical problems. And the church today often has serious defects. But please remember that no faulty congregation can ever destroy or disturb the Great Cornerstone of the church-Jesus Christ Himself. So in imperfect churches we must keep our primary gaze on the Savior who ministers to us. Despite its faults, the church belongs to Him, so focus on Christ.<br>
“CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH AND GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR HER to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.”-Ephesians 5:25-27.<br>
The church is so important to Jesus that He “gave himself up for her” when He died for each of us individually and for the church collectively. So church membership should be important to you. Are you a member of Christ’s body?<br>

How many true faiths does Jesus have in the world?<br>
“There is one body and one Spirit,…one Lord, ONE FAITH, one baptism.”-Ephesians 4:4, 5.<br>
Since Christ has only “one faith,” how can we know which one it is? Jesus gives us the key:<br>
“If anyone chooses to do God’s will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.”-John 7:17. (See also John 8:31, 32.)<br>
When we make a commitment to do God’s will, He will help us see whether the teaching is from God or is only human tradition. The key ingredient when finding a church is examining its respect for and allegiance to the Word of God. Genuine fellowship is built around Scripture, not just around a charismatic leader or a great institution.<br>
Continue making discoveries in these guides, walk in the light as God reveals it to you from the Bible, and He will make plain His will for you. A growing Christian is a person who opens heart and mind to accept the truth as God reveals it from His Word.<br>

In Guide 16 we discovered that experiencing Sabbath rest is an important antidote to today’s stressful living. Since God understands our every need, He established each seventh day for our physical rest and our spiritual refreshment. After creating our world in six days, He “rested” on the seventh day, “blessed” and “made it holy” (Genesis 2:1-3).<br>
When God gave the Ten Commandments to His people, Israel, He placed the commandments to observe the seventh-day Sabbath at the heart of His law (Exodus 20:8-11). According to this commandment, the Sabbath is a memorial of God’s creative power, a day to pause and think about the beauties and wonders of His created works, a day to relax and come close to our Creator, a day to explore in greater depth our relationship with Him.<br>
During Jesus’ human life on earth, He too kept the Sabbath (Luke 4:16) and endorsed it as a day that benefits Christians (Mark 2:27, 28). Several texts in the book of Acts make it clear that Christ’s disciples worshiped on the Sabbath after His resurrection (Acts 13:14; 16:13; 17:2; 18:1-4, 11).<br>

This brings us to a subject that many find perplexing. The Christian world has for some time observed two different days. On one hand, most Christians sincerely observe Sunday, the first day of the week, which they believe to be a memorial of Christ’s resurrection. On the other hand, a large group of Christians, equally sincere, believe that the Bible honors only the seventh-day as the Sabbath and nowhere affirms the sanctity of Sunday.<br>
Does it really make any difference which day we observe as the Sabbath? As sincere and earnest people who want to know the truth, we must always ask ourselves: “What matters to Jesus? What does Jesus desire me to do?”<br>
In coming to a decision about this, several important facts need to be made clear: Who changed the Sabbath from Saturday, the seventh day of the week, to Sunday, the first day of the week? Does the Bible authorize such a shift? If so, did God, Christ, or perhaps the apostles make the change?<br>
We’ll proceed by looking at all the possibilities.<br>

Is there any pronouncement from God that changes the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week?<br>
Most Christians accept the Ten Commandments as a valid guide to live by. They are the only message God have ever personally written out for the human race. They are so important, He wrote them on stone with His own finger (Exodus 31:18).<br>
In the fourth commandment God instructs us:<br>
“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but THE SEVENTH DAY IS THE SABBATH TO THE LORD YOUR GOD. On it you shall not do any work…. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he RESTED on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD BLESSED the Sabbath day and MADE IT HOLY.”-Exodus 20:8-11. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
When God gave the Ten Commandments to His people, He also made it clear that no human being should revise or edit the instruction from His holy lips.<br>
“DO NOT ADD to what I command you and DO NOT SUBTRACT from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you.”-Deuteronomy 4:2.<br>
God Himself pledges not to alter His commands:<br>
“I WILL NOT violate my covenant or ALTER WHAT MY LIPS HAVE UTTERED.”-Psalm 89:34.<br>
The Bible is clear that God did not change the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week.<br>

According to Jesus, the Ten Commandments are not subject to change:<br>
“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.”-Matthew 5:17-18.<br>
In guide 16 we discovered that it was Jesus’ custom to worship in the synagogue on the Sabbath (Luke 4:16). We also discovered that Jesus wanted His disciples to continue experiencing the joys of true Sabbath-keeping (Matthew 24:20).<br>
It is clear from Jesus’ teaching and example that we still need the Sabbath for rest, relaxation, and spending time with God.<br>

James, the first leader of the early Christian church, wrote concerning the Ten Commandments:<br>
“For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.”-James 2:10, 11.<br>
Luke, a physician and evangelist in the early church, reports:<br>
“On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.”-Acts 16:13.<br>
The New Testament book of Acts mentions 84 times when the Sabbath was observed by Christ’s followers, all of them more than 14 years after the resurrection of Jesus: 2 Sabbaths at Antioch (Acts 13:14, 42, 44); 1 at Philippi (Acts 16:13); 3 at Thessalonica (Acts 17:2, 3); 78 Sabbaths at Corinth (Acts 18:4, 11).<br>
John, the last of the twelve apostles to die, kept the Sabbath. He wrote:<br>
“On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit.”-Revelation 1:10.<br>
According to Jesus, the Lord’s Day is the Sabbath:<br>
“The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”-Matthew 12:8.<br>
A search of the scriptural evidence reveals that the apostles made no attempt to change God’s day of rest from the seventh to the first day of the week. The New Testament mentions the first day of the week only eight times. In none of these instances is the first day of the week spoken of as a holy day, nor is it even hinted that we should set it aside as a day of worship. A critical examination of the eight texts referring to the first day of the week points out these Sunday events:<br>
(1) The women came to the tomb on the first day of the week (Matthew 28:1).<br>
(2) “When the Sabbath was over” the women resumed their secular activities on the first day of the week (Mark 16:1, 2).<br>
(3)Jesus appeared first to Mary Magdalene early the first day of the week (Mark 16:9).<br>
(4)Jesus’ followers resumed their secular activities on the first day of the week (Luke 24:1).<br>
(5)Mary went to the grave of Jesus and found the tomb empty on the first day of the week (John 20:1).<br>
(6)The disciples gathered together “for fear of the Jews” (not worship) on the first day of the week (John 20:19).<br>
(7)Paul asked church members to take account of their funds on the first day of the week, and “set aside a sum of money” for the poor at Jerusalem (1 Corinthians 16:1, 2). The passage does not mention any religious meeting.<br>
(8)In Acts 20:7 Luke speaks of Paul’s preaching on the first day of the week at an incidental farewell meeting. Of course Paul preached every day, and the apostles broke bread daily (Acts 2:46).<br>
None of these scriptures suggest that the apostles intended to stop observing the seventh-day Sabbath. The apostles mentioned no change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week. There is clearly no New Testament evidence for a change of the Sabbath from Saturday, the seventh day of the week, to Sunday, the first day of the week. The change came after the days of Jesus and the apostles, so we must turn to history to see when and how the change came about.<br>

The apostles clearly warn us that some Christians would drift away from the doctrines of New Testament Christianity: “So be on guard!” (Acts 20:29-31). And that is exactly what happened. Credible historians clearly record how Christians began to stray from apostolic purity. Traditions and doctrines which Paul, Peter, and the other founders of the Christian church had never endorsed gradually crept into the church.<br>
The change from Sabbath observance to Sunday observance took place after the New Testament was completed and the apostles had all died. History records that Christians eventually shifted from worshiping and resting on the seventh day to the first day of the week. But of course believers didn’t stop observing the seventh-day Sabbath on a given weekend and then suddenly begin keeping Sunday as the Lord’s Day. The earliest authentic instance of Sunday observance by Christians occurred in Italy, in the middle of the second century after Christ. For a long time after that many Christians observed both days, while still others kept only the Sabbath.<br>
On March 7, A.D.321, Constantine the Great issued the first civil Sunday law, compelling all the people, except the farmers, in the Roman Empire to rest on Sunday. This, with five other civil laws decreed by Constantine concerning Sunday, set the legal precedent for all civil Sunday legislation from that time to the present. In the fourth century the Council of Laodicea prohibited Christians from abstaining from work on the Sabbath, while urging them to honor Sunday by abstaining from work if at all possible.<br>
History shows that Sunday worship and observance is a man-made custom. The Bible gives no authority for doing away with the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment. The prophet Daniel predicted that during the Christian era a deceptive power would attempt to change God’s law (Daniel 7:25).<br>

Who officially moved the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day of the week? The Catholic Church claims to have done so. In an attempt to save the crumbling Roman Empire, well-meaning church leaders compromised and attempted to change the day of worship from Saturday to Sunday.<br>
A catechism of the Roman Catholic Church reads:<br>
“Q. Which is the Sabbath day?<br>
“A. Saturday is the Sabbath day.<br>
“Q. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?<br>
“A. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church… transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.”-Peter Geiermann, The Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine (1957 edition), p.50<br>
The Catholic Church proudly announces that human church leaders made the change.<br>
“The holy day, the Sabbath, was changed from Saturday to Sunday… not from any directions noted in the Scriptures, but from the Church’s sense of its own power…. People who think that the Scriptures should be the sole authority, should logically become 7th Day Adventists, and keep Saturday holy.”-Cardinal Maida, Archbishop of Detroit, Saint Catherine Catholic Church Sentinel, Algonac, Michigan, May 21, 1995.<br>

Official documents outlining the beliefs of several Protestant denominations agree that the Bible provides no authority for Sunday observance.<br>
Martin Luther, founder of the Lutheran Church, wrote in the Augsburg Confession, Article 28, paragraph 9:<br>
“They [the Roman Catholics] allege the Sabbath changed into Sunday, the Lord’s Day, contrary to the decalogue [the Ten Commandments],… neither is there any example more boasted of than the changing of the Sabbath day. Great, say they, is the power and authority of the church, since it dispensed with one of the ten commandments.”<br>
Methodist theologians Amos Binney and Daniel Steele observed:<br>
“It is true, there is no positive command for infant baptism… nor is there any for keeping holy the first day of the week.”-Theological Compend (New York: Methodist Book Concern, 1902), pp. 180, 181.<br>
Dr. N. Summerbell, historian of the Disciples of Christ or Christian Church, wrote: “The Roman Church had totally apostatized…. It reversed the Fourth Commandment by doing away with the Sabbath of God’s Word, and instituting Sunday as a holy day.”-A True History of the Christian and the Christian Church, pp. 417, 418.<br>

This brings us face-to-face with the questions: Why do so many Christians observe Sunday without Bible authority? Even more important, Which day shall I keep? Shall I follow those who say, “I don’t think it makes any difference which day I observe as long as I keep one day in seven”? Or, shall I count as important the day Jesus, our Creator, established when He created our world, and the day God pointed out in the Ten Commandments: “the seventh day is the Sabbath”?<br>
Here we are dealing with more than just an outward observance, but which day happens to be biblically correct. The essential issue is that of obedience to Jesus. Our Creator set aside the Sabbath as a “holy” day, as a time for us and our families to come closer to Him for strength and refreshment. Whom shall I obey? Shall I obey Christ, the Son of God, or human tradition in the matter of the day I keep holy? The choice is clear: the teachings of men or the commands of God. The word of men or the Word of the God. A human substitute or a divine command.<br>
The prophet Daniel sounds a warning to those who would “try to change the set times and the laws” (Daniel 7:25, NIV) [“intend to change times and law” (Daniel 7:25, NKJV)]. God is calling His people back to obedience. He invites them to keep the Sabbath as a symbol of loyalty and love to Him.<br>
Jesus said, “If you love me, you will obey what I command” (John 14:15). And He promises fullness of joy to those who love Him enough to obey His commands (John 15:9-11). We have a wonderful Savior. He is eager for us to experience His love in all its fullness. A heart of willing obedience opens the door wide to that love.<br>
In the Garden of Gethsemane Christ submitted completely to the Father’s will-even though He faced the cross and the sins of the world were crushing out His life. As He cried out to God, “Take this cup from me,” He remained surrendered in His pleading, and added, “Yet not what I will, but what you will” (Mark 14:36).<br>
Christ longs for us to experience the fulfillment that a truly surrendered life brings. And He also wants us to experience the joy of Sabbath rest. He wants us to trust Him enough to obey Him in all the details of life. If you answer God’s call and obey all of His commandments, you will experience the promise of Jesus that His joy will “be in you” and “your joy” will “be complete” (John 15:11).<br>

A young mother in the suburbs finds that her child has contracted AIDS from a contaminated blood transfusion.<br>
The tragedies go on and on in our world. And we long so much for an answer to it all. Where is God in a world of meaningless suffering and death? The psalmist assures us that “the earth is full of his unfailing love” (Psalms 33:5).<br>
But if that is true, Why doesn’t He bring an end to suffering and tragedy? The 20th chapter of Revelation shows us how and when God will bring sin and suffering to an end.<br>

Revelation 20 zeros in on a 1,000-year period that follows the second coming of Christ. The events surrounding this 1,000-year period are the final act in the conflict between Christ and Satan that has been going on since sin entered the universe.<br>
This drama began in heaven when Lucifer became jealous of Christ, started a war with the unfallen angels, was expelled, and fled to our world. The drama continued on earth in the Garden of Eden, then down through the centuries until it reached its first climax when the Devil impelled human beings to crucify Christ. (You may wish to review this sad story in Guide 3.) The drama will reached its final climax at the close of the 1,000-year period when our sinful world is cleansed and placed under Christ’s control. Revelation 20 shows us that the 1,000-year period is separated by two resurrections.<br>
Who does God raise from the dead in the first resurrection that takes place at the beginning of the 1,000 years? <br>
“Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.”-Revelation 20:6. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
The “blessed and holy,” those who have accepted Jesus as their Savior, come up in the “first resurrection.” If the righteous are to “reign with” Christ during the 1,000 years, they must be resurrected at the beginning of the 1,000 years.<br>
Who are raised in the second resurrection at the close of the thousand-year period?<br>
“The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.”-Revelation 20:5.<br>
The “rest of the dead” can refer only to the wicked dead, because the righteous, “the blessed and holy,” are resurrected at the beginning of the 1,000 years.<br>
So the 1,000-year period is marked off by two resurrections: the resurrection of the righteous at its beginning, and the resurrection of the wicked at its close.<br>

The first resurrection, that of the righteous, takes place at the second coming of Christ.<br>
”For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with… the trumpet call of God, and THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL RISE first. After that, WE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE and are left WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM in the clouds TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR. And so we will be with the Lord forever.”-Thessalonians 4:16, 17.<br>
When Jesus comes to this earth, He raises “the dead in Christ” and takes them, along with the righteous who are alive, to heaven. Because the wicked still cling to sin, they can’t exist in God’s presence, and they are destroyed at Christ’s coming (Luke 17:26-30). (You may wish to review in Guide 8 the events surrounding Jesus’ return.)<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
When the 1,000 years begin, the righteous have all gone to heaven and the wicked are all dead. What will happen on this world during the 1,000 years?<br>
“And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended.”-Revelation 20:1-3.<br>
At Jesus’ coming Satan is bound and will remain in chains during the 1,000 years. Where is Satan imprisoned? In the “Abyss,” a Greek word that means “very deep” or “bottomless.” In Genesis 1:2 the Greek version of the Old Testament uses the word “Abyss” to describe the earth in its undeveloped state before the days of creation began. So our earth is the Abyss where God imprisons Satan.<br>
Scriptures describes Satan as bound by “a great chain.” Is this a literal chain? No, it is symbolic, a chain of circumstances. Satan would like very much to continue deceiving people during the 1,000 years. But he can find no righteous people to tempt, because they are all in heaven. And he can find no wicked to lead, because they are all dead, asleep in the dust of the earth. Unable to deceive or tempt anyone, he roams an empty world forced to ponder all the heartaches and tragedy he has caused.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The thousand-year period is also a time of judgment. But remember that the judgment consists of four main stages:<br>
(1)The pre-advent judgment of the righteous before Christ’s second coming.<br>
(2)The reward of the righteous at the Second Coming.<br>
(3)The judgment of the wicked during the 1,000 years.<br>
(4)The reward of Satan and the wicked at the end of that period. (You may wish to review Guide 13 that deals with stages 1 and 2 of the judgment, the investigation and reward of the righteous.) We will now look at stages 3 and 4, the investigation and reward of the wicked.<br>
We’ve seen that the righteous dead who have been resurrected and the righteous who are alive are taken to heaven together at the second coming of Christ. They are at home in heaven during 1,000 years. What will they be doing?<br>
“Do you not know that THE SAINTS [the saved] WILL JUDGED THE WORLD?... Do you not know that we will JUDGE ANGELS?”-1 Corinthians 6:2-3.<br>
“I SAW THE THRONES ON WHICH WERE SEATED THOSE WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN AUTHORITY TO JUDGE….THEY CAME TO LIFE AND REIGNED WITH CHRIST A THOUSAND YEARS.”-Revelation 20:4.<br>
During the 1,000 years, the righteous will review the cases of wicked human beings and fallen angels, including their leader, Satan. How fitting for the martyrs, the overcomers, and battle-scarred adherents of the gospel to examine and understand God’s judgment of the wicked.<br>
God has graciously given redeemed human beings the change to evaluate His dealings with the wicked. We may have a lot of questions, like: “Why isn’t my aunt here? She seemed like such a good person.” When we go over the records and judge the dead “according to what they had done as recorded in the books” (verse 12), we will see for ourselves that in all His dealings with human beings, God has been just and fair with everyone. We’ll see how the Holy Spirit offered people chance after chance to yield to God, and the fairness of each sentence will become plain.<br>

At the close of the 1,000 years, the Bible declares:<br>
“I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.”-Revelation 21:2.<br>
This wonderful city has been our home for a thousand years. Now the Holy City-with Christ and all the people He’s redeemed inside-descends from heaven to our world. <br>
What does Satan do at the close of the 1,000 years?<br>
“When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth… to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore. They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves.”-Revelation 20:7-9.<br>
The wicked are resurrected in the second resurrection at the close of the 1,000 years (verse 5). When the righteous descend to earth in the Holy City and the wicked are resurrected, Satan will be “set free for a short time” (verse 3). He again has the wicked to lead and the righteous as his target. Not wasting a moment, he immediately begins to organize the wicked into a vast army. Satan gives the command to march against the city. As the wicked take up positions around the New Jerusalem (verse 9), they catch a glimpse of the horror of being lost-lost forever.<br>

Here, for the first time, all the human race meets together face-to-face. Jesus leads the redeemed children of God who are inside the city. Satan heads the throngs of the wicked who are outside the walls. At this critical moment, God carries out the final stage of judgment and the wicked receive their day in court. <br>
“Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it…. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and…. the dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.”-Revelation 20:11, 12.<br>
As the wicked stand before the throne of justice, their whole life opens before them. From the records contained in heaven, Jesus, the righteous Judge, formally unfolds the full story of His dealings with fallen men, women, and angels.<br>
The entire universe looks on with intense interest. Standing before the throne of God, Jesus gives everyone a comprehensive view of His redemptive work. He reveals that He came to seek and save the lost. He entered our world in human flesh, lived a sinless life amid struggles and temptations, made the ultimate sacrifice on the cross, and served as our Priest in heaven. Finally, when Christ sorrowfully steps forward and passes sentence on those who’ve persisted in rejecting His grace, every being in the universe will acknowledge the justice and necessity of this final act of divine judgment.<br>
“We will all stand before God’s judgment seat. It is written: ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.’”-Romans 14:10-11.<br>
“Christ Jesus… become obedient to death-even death on a cross!... At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth,… and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”-Philippians 2:5-11.<br>
Ever since sin began, the Devil has been slandering God’s character, accusing Him of being unfair. But now all the questions are answered, all the perplexities resolved. Now every being in the universe acknowledges that Jesus, the Lamb of God, is worthy of our love and worship. The whole plan and purpose of God is now fully revealed, and God’s character stands vindicated.<br>
Not only the saved, but also evil angels and Satan himself will confess that Satan’s&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Even though Satan and the vast throng of wicked people admit that God’s way is right, their hearts are not changed, their characters remain evil. And after judgment is pronounced, the wicked:<br>
“Marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur…. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”-Revelation 20:9-15.<br>
In final judgment the fires of the eternal God will destroy sin and those who stubbornly cling to it. Satan and all the lost perish in this “second death,” an eternal death from which there is no awakening. Their course of rebellion has left the wicked unfit for real happiness, and they are destroyed with the Devil and his angels. The heavenly fire completely cleanses the earth of the ravages of sin; God has a clean universe at last, never again to be scarred by evil. The epic struggle between good and evil, between Christ and Satan, is finally over, and Christ reigns. The curtain falls on the ancient drama of sin, and rises on the glory of a new world of limitless possibilities.<br>

From the ashes of this final, cleansing holocaust, God will create a new world:<br>
“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away…. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God… ‘Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away…. I am making everything new!’”-Revelation 21:1-5.<br>
Restored to its original beauty, the earth becomes the home of the redeemed for endless ages. Freed from selfishness, sickness, and suffering, we have a whole universe to explore, wonderful relationships to develop, and an eternity in which to sit at Jesus’ feet to listen, learn, and love. (For a full description of that new world, you may wish to again read Guide 9.)<br>
Where do you plan to be in that day? Have you decided to be with Christ inside the city and saved forever? Or will you be outside the city without Christ and lost forever?<br>
If you have placed your life in the hands of Jesus, you need never experience the unspeakable horror of those on the outside of the city who realize they are lost forever. No matter what life has brought to you, if you place your life in the hands of Jesus now, you can be inside the city with Christ and the redeemed. If you have not done so, give your heart to Jesus now, and He will surround you with His love and forgiveness. This is your opportunity. This is your day of salvation.<br>

A senseless shooting occurred when a student marched into his school and killed several of his classmates. A disgruntled man who had been fired from his job, entered the place of his former employment and shot his superior. A mother pushed her car into a lake with her two children inside and drowned them.<br>
On at least two continents many thousands have been slaughtered in ethnic cleansing. Centuries old feuds between two or more ethnic groups are the reason. Men, women, children, and even babies have been shot, cut up, beat up, and raped.<br>
Punishing these barbaric crimes with the death penalty, even for cold-blooded murderers, is condemned by many. Groups against the death penalty protest loudly, calling it an inhumane “paganistic ritual.” They ask, are these killers beyond redemption?<br>
What is the most humane way of executing condemned criminals? The electric chair? Some think an injection with a lethal drug would be the most painless. Others maintain that life would end more quickly by hanging.<br>
But in all this passionate debate over the death penalty, there is one option no one considers. No one suggests that cold-blooded killers, who have cruelly ended another’s life, pay with physical agony by being tortured to death. No one, for example, has suggested that these murderers slowly burn to death.<br>
But many sincere Christians do assume that our heavenly Father will do more than that. The wicked, they say, must be tortured in order to pay for their sins. And what’s more, they picture God’s execution grounds as a place of endless torment.<br>
Just what does happen to the wicked? How does their fate fit in with God’s love and justice? Let’s look for the Bible answer.<br>

For 6,000 years God has been pleading with men and women:<br>
“As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live.”-Ezekiel 33:11. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
The cross revealed how much God wants to rescue fallen humanity. When Jesus cried out on the cross, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing,” He laid bare His aching heart (Luke 23:34). Soon afterward Jesus yielded up His life and, some believe, died of a broken heart (John 19:30, 34).<br>
But even with this powerful demonstration of divine love, many individuals will still not turn to Jesus. And as long as sin rules in this world, it will continue to multiply human misery. So sin has to be destroyed. How does God plan to put an end to sin?<br>
“The day of the Lord will come…. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the EARTH AND EVERYTHING IN IT WILL BE BURNED UP.”-2 Peter 3:10, margin.<br>
God must finally cleanse the universe of evil and put an end to sin. Those who persist in holding on to sin will eventually destroyed by this fire that is prepared to destroy the Devil, his angels, and sin from our world. What a heartbreaking time for Jesus as He sees the fire consume the ones He Died to save.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Contrary to some popular conceptions, God doesn’t have a fire burning now in a place termed “hell” where sinners go at death. Hell happens when this earth is turned into a lake of fire. God waits to carry out the sentence on the wicked until the final judgment at the end of the 1,000 years (Revelation 20:9-15).<br>
“The Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment until THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.”-2 Peter 2:9, margin.<br>
He also cleanses our world with this purifying fire.<br>
“The present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for THE DAY OF JUDGMENT and destruction of ungodly men.”-2 Peter 3:7.<br>
God never planned for any human being to end his or her life in the fires of hell. But when people refuse to break with Satan and hold on to their sins, they must finally receive the consequences of their choices.<br>
“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS.’”-Matthew 25:41.<br>
According to Jesus, when will hell burn?<br>
“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be AT THE END OF THE AGE [WORLD, KJV]. The Son of Man will send out his ANGELS, and they will WEED OUT of his kingdom EVERYTHING THAT CAUSES SIN AND ALL WHO DO EVIL. THEY WILL THROW THEM INTO THE FIERY FURNACE, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.-Matthew 13:40-42.<br>
The weeds, the evil-doers, aren’t burned until the end of the world. Before this sentence is carried out, the whole universe must be assured that God has been fair in his dealings with every human being. As detailed in Guide 22, in the great controversy going on between Christ and Satan, Satan has been attempting to prove to the universe that the way of sin is the better way; Jesus has been demonstrating that the way of obedience is the key to a more satisfying life.<br>
At the close of the 1,000 years, this demonstration will culminate in the judgment of Satan, his angles, and the wicked. After the record books are opened which reveal the part that each person has played in this great drama, God will throw Satan, death, and the grave, along with everyone whose name “was not found written in the book of life… into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:14-15). According to the next verse, Revelation 21:1, after God cleanses the earth from sin with fire, He creates “a new heaven and a new earth.”<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Many believers accept the idea that the fires of hell last forever, resulting in eternal torment. Let’s look carefully at texts which describe God’s treatment of sin and sinners.<br>
“He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be PUNISHED WITH EVERLASTING DESTRUCTION and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power.”-2 Thessalonians 1:8, 9.<br>
Please note that “everlasting destruction” is not the same as “everlasting torment.” It is simply means, a destruction that lasts forever. The effect is everlasting death. Peter spoke of the day of judgment and “destruction of ungodly men” (2 Peter 3:7).<br>
According to Jesus, both “soul and body” are destroyed in hell (Matthew 10:28). In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus talked about the narrow gate “that leads to life,” and the broad road “that leads to destruction” (Matthew 7:13, 14). In John 3:16 Jesus explains that God “gave His one and only Son,” that those who believe might not “perish, but have eternal life.” Jesus contrasts two fates: everlasting life or perishing-not eternal burning. We must conclude that hell definitely has an ending; it results in the death and destruction of the wicked.<br>
Clear statements throughout Scripture tell us the wicked will be destroyed. “The wicked will be cut off” (Psalms 37:28), they “will perish” (2 Peter 2:12), “they will vanish like smoke” (Psalm 37:20). The fire will reduce them to ashes (Malachi 4:1-3). “The wages of sin is death,” not eternal life in hellfire; “the gift of God is eternal life” (Romans 6:23).<br>
The purpose of the final punishment in hellfire is to rid the universe of sin, not to preserve sin forever. It is extremely hard to imagine that the Christ who wept over the fate of stubborn Jerusalem and who forgave those who put Him to death, would be able to spend eternity watching over the agonies of the damned.<br>
Hell definitely has an ending. At the close of the 1,000 years, God rains fire down from the skies and eliminates the Devil, his angels, and the wicked who persist in holding on to their sins. “Fire” comes “down from heaven” and devours them (Revelation 20:9).<br>
According to Jesus, this fire is “unquenchable” (Matthew 3:12). No fire brigade will be able to put it out until it has done its work of complete destruction.<br>
God promises that, out of this cleansing fire, he will create “a new earth,” in which the “the past troubles will be forgotten;” and “the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more” (Isaiah 65: 16-19).<br>
What a day that will be! Every cause for heartache will have vanished. God will erase the wounds of sin from every heart, and our happiness will be complete.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
In Matthew 25:41 Jesus speaks of “the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” Does “eternal” here suggest hell is forever? Jude 7 presents Sodom and Gomorrah “as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.” Obviously those cities aren’t still burning. But the fire WAS eternal in the sense that it resulted in permanent destruction. <br>
In 2 Peter 2:6 once more we read of eternal fire. But this scripture also clearly points out that God “condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly.” The ungodly of Sodom and Gomorrah are not still in agony; they were reduced to ashes long ago. And yet the fire that burned them is “eternal” in its consequences-permanent destruction. Eternal means permanent punishment, not punishing.<br>
Because the book of Revelation uses such vivid, symbolic language, some of its passages have been misunderstood. For example, Revelation 14:11 says of the lost, “the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever.” This sounds like endless suffering. But, again, let’s let Scripture interpret Scripture.<br>
Exodus 21:6 in the KJV speaks of a servant’s having his ear drilled through as a sign that he was to serve his master “forever.” In this case “forever” would be as long as the servant’s life would last. Jonah, who spent only three days and three nights in the belly of the whale (Matthew 12:40), reports that he was there “forever” (Jonah 2:6). No doubt three days in the slimy darkness did seem like forever.<br>
So we must be careful to understand how and when Scripture uses symbolic, poetic language. The smoke ascending forever from the lake of fire is a vivid way of expressing eternal destruction. Revelation 21:8 tells us plainly that the lake which burns with fire and brimstone “is the second death.” Hell has an ending. The wicked are consumed; they are destroyed.<br>

In the beginning God created a perfect world. But sin came in and brought disaster, decay, and death. If you returned home some evening and found your house ransacked and wrecked, would you leave it that way forever? Of course not. You would sweep out the dirt and rubbish, clean the place from top to bottom, and throw away furniture ruined beyond repair. God will do the same. He will take care of the wreckage and pollution of sin once and for all, creating a new earth in its place. God’s purpose for having this world purified by fire is to prepare the way for a perfect world for the saved to live in.<br>
But God faces a serious problem because sin not only wrecked the physical world, it also infected people. Sin damages our relationship with Him and with each other. Humanity continues to be plagued by child abuse, terrorism, pornography, and a thousand other cancers of the soul. God must someday destroy sin, because sin is destroying people. God’s dilemma is this: how to eliminate the deadly virus of sin from the world and yet not destroy all the people infected by it? His solution was to take on the virus in His own body; He allowed the cancer of sin to destroy Him at the cross. As a result:<br>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and PURIFY US FROM ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.-1 John 1:9.<br>
God offers His solution to the sin problem freely to everyone. But the sad fact is, some insist on clinging to the disease of sin. And God will not force people to choose His way of eternal life. Those who reject His solution will finally be consumed by the disease. The real reason for hell is this:<br>
“For I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.”-Isaiah 65:12.<br>
Cut off from Jesus by their own choices, the wicked will discover that the only alternative is eternal death.<br>

Even though the Scriptures do not teach that the fire of hell results in endless suffering, it does give us a glimpse of what a terrible experience it is to be lost. The wicked are going to miss out on eternal life. What a horror it will be to realize that the joy of eternal life with God has slipped through their hands, that they’ll never, ever experience the bliss of perfect, loving relationships throughout the ages.<br>
When Christ hung on the cross with the world’s sins separating Him from the Father, He must have felt the agony of the eternally lost. As the wicked look into the black void ahead of them, they see only eternal destruction. They must die with no hope of a second resurrection. At the same time they see how they pushed Christ away time after time when He came near with overtures of love. In the end they fall to their knees and acknowledge God’s justice and His love (Philippians 2:10, 11). <br>
No wonder Bible writers urgently press on us the weight of our choices and the claims of Christ.<br>
“We urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. For he says, ‘In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.’ I tell you, NOW is the time of God’s favor, NOW is the day of salvation.”-2 Corinthians 6:1-2.<br>
I can think of no greater tragedy than someone wasting the priceless sacrifice of Jesus by choosing to be lost. The alternatives facing us are starkly clear: eternal destruction-an eternity excluded from the presence of God, or an eternal friendship with Christ that fulfills our deepest longings. Which do you choose for yourself? Why not discover your destiny in Christ today?<br>

We cringe when a child first asks, “What does it mean to die?” We shrink from talking about or even thinking about someone we love dying. Death is the common enemy of people everywhere.<br>
What are the answers to the hard questions about death? Is there life after death? Will we see our dead loved ones again?<br>

All of us at certain moments, perhaps right after the passing of a friend or loved one, have felt that emptiness in the pit of our stomachs, that lonely feeling that sweeps over us, as we catch a glimpse of the end of life.<br>
In a matter so important, so packed with emotion, where can we learn the truth about what happens when we die? Fortunately, part of Christ’s mission on earth was to “free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death” (Hebrews 2:15). And in the Bible, Jesus presents comforting messages, and answers clearly all our questions about death and a future life.<br>

To understand from the Bible the real truth about death, let’s start at the beginning and see how our Creator made us.<br>
“The LORD God formed the man [adam, Hebrew] from the DUST OF THE GROUND [adamah, Hebrew] and breathed into his nostrils THE BREATH OF LIFE, and the man became A LIVING BEING [SOUL, Hebrew].”-Genesis 2:7. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].) <br>
At Creation God fashioned Adam from “the dust of the ground.” He had a brain in his head ready to think; blood in his veins ready to flow. Then God breathed into his nostrils “the breath of life,” and Adam became “a living being” [Hebrew, “a living soul”]. Note carefully, the Bible does not say Adam received a soul; rather it says that “man became a living soul.” As God breathed into Adam, life began to flow from God. The combination of the body and “the breath of life” made Adam “a living being,” “a living soul.” So we might write the human equation like this:<br>
“Dust of Ground” + “Breath of Life” = “A living Soul”<br>
Lifeless Body + Breath from God = A Living Being<br>
Each of us has a body and a reasoning mind. As long as we continue to breathe, we will be a living being, a living soul.<br>

At death the reverse of the creative process described in Genesis 2:7 takes place:<br>
“And the DUST returns to the ground it came from, and the SPIRIT [BREATH OF LIFE] returns to God who gave it.”-Ecclesiastes 12:7.<br>
The Bible often uses the Hebrew words for “breath” and the “spirit” interchangeably. When people die, their body becomes “dust” and the “spirit” (the “breath of life”) returns to God, its source. But what happens to the soul?<br>
“As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD,… every LIVING SOUL belongs to me…. THE SOUL WHO SINS IS THE ONE WHO WILL DIE.”-Ezekiel 18:3-4.<br>
The soul dies! It is not now immortal-it can perish.<br>
The equation derived from Genesis 2:7, when God made us, reverses itself at death. <br>
“Dust of Earth” – “Breath of Life” = “A Dead Soul”<br>
Lifeless Body – Breath from God = A Dead Being<br>
Death is the cessation of life. The body disintegrates to dust, and the breath, or spirit, goes back to God. We are a living soul in life, but in death only a corpse, a dead soul, dead being. So the dead are not conscious. When God takes back the breath of life He gave to us, our soul dies. But as we will see later in this lesson, with Christ there is hope.<br>

After death the brain disintegrates; it can’t know or remember anything. All human emotions cease at death.<br>
“Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished....”-Ecclesiastes 9:6.<br>
The dead are not conscious, so they are not aware of anything that takes place. They have absolutely no contact with the living:<br>
“For the living know that they will die, but THE DEAD KNOW NOTHING.”-Ecclesiastes 9:5.<br>
Death is like a dreamless sleep-in fact, the Bible calls death a “sleep” 54 times. Jesus taught that death is like a sleep. He said to His disciples:<br>
“’Our friend LAZARUS HAS FALLEN ASLEEP; but I am going there to wake him up.’ His disciples replied, ‘Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.’ Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. So then he told them plainly, ‘LAZARUS IS DEAD.’”-John 11:11-14.<br>
Lazarus was dead for four days before Jesus arrived. But when Jesus went to his tomb, He proved that it is easy for God to raise the dead as for us to awaken a sleeping companion. <br>
It’s a great comfort to know that our deceased loved ones are “asleep,” resting peacefully in Jesus. The tunnel of death, which we ourselves may someday pass through, is like quite, peaceful sleep.<br>

The sleep of death is not the end of the story. At the tomb, Jesus said to Martha, Lazarus’ sister:<br>
“I AM THE RESURRECTION and the life. HE WHO BELIEVES IN ME WILL LIVE, even though he dies.”-John 11:25.<br>
Those who die “in Christ” sleep in the grave-but they still have a bright future. The One who counts every hair on our heads and holds us in the palm of His hand will not forget us. We may die and return to the dust, but the record of our individuality remains clear in the mind of God. And when Jesus comes, He will awaken the righteous dead from their sleep, just like He did Lazarus.<br>
“We do not want you to be ignorant about THOSE WHO FALL ASLEEP, OR TO GRIEVE LIKE THE REST OF MEN, WHO HAVE NO HOPE…. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL RISE FIRST. After that, WE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE and are left WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. THEREFORE ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER WITH THESE WORDS.”-1 Thessalonians 4:13, 16-18.<br>
On resurrection day, the tunnel of death will seem like a brief rest. The dead are not aware of time passing. Those who have accepted Christ as their Savior, will be awakened from sleep by His wonderful voice coming down to earth.<br>
The hope of resurrection has a companion: the hope of a heavenly home where God “will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain” (Revelation 21:4). Those who love God don’t have to fear death. Beyond it lies an eternity of a fulfilling life with God. Jesus holds “the keys of death” (Revelation 1:18). Without Christ, death would be a one-way street ending in oblivion, but with Christ there is a bright, radiant hope.<br>

When God created Adam and Eve, they were created mortal, that is, subject to death. Had they remained obedient to God’s will they would never have died. But when they sinned, they gave up their right to life. By disobedience they became subject to death. Their sins infected the entire human race, and since all have sinned, we are all mortal, subject to death (Romans 5:12). And there is not even a hint in the Bible that the human soul can exist as a conscious entity after death.<br>
The Bible never once describes the soul as now being immortal-that is, not subject to death. The Hebrew words for “soul,” “spirit,” and “breath” occur in the Bible 1,700 times. But not once is the human soul, spirit, breath referred to as immortal. At the present time God alone possesses immortality.<br>
“God…ALONE IS IMMORTAL.”-1 Timothy 6:15, 16.<br>
Scriptures makes it clear that people in this life are mortal: subject to death. But when Jesus returns, our nature will undergo a radical change. <br>
“Listen, I tell you a mystery: WE WILL NOT ALL SLEEP, but WE WILL ALL BE CHANGED-in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, AT THE LAST TRUMPET. For the trumpet will sound, THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED imperishable, AND WE WILL BE CHANGED. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and THE MORTAL WITH IMMORTALITY.-1 Corinthians 15:51-53.<br>
As human beings, we are not now immortal. But the Christian’s assurance is that we become immortal when Jesus comes again a second time. The certainty of the promise of immortality was demonstrated when Jesus burst open His tomb and:<br>
“DESTROYED DEATH and… BROUGHT LIFE AND IMMORTALITY TO LIGHT through the gospel.”-1 Timothy 1:10.<br>
God’s perspective on human destiny is clear: eternal death for those who reject Christ and cling to their sins, or immortality as a gift when Jesus comes for those who have accepted Him as Lord and Savior.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The fears that we naturally struggle with in the face of death become especially acute when a loved one dies. The loneliness and sense of loss can be overwhelming. The only solution to the anguish caused by separation from a loved one is the comfort that only Christ gives. Remember that your loved one is asleep, and your loved ones who rest in Jesus will rise in the “resurrection of life” when Jesus comes.<br>
God is planning some wonderful reunions. Children will be returned to their ecstatic parents. Husbands and wives will melt into each other’s arms. Life’s cruel separations will be over. “Death has been swallowed up in victory” (1 Corinthians 15:54).<br>
Some feel the separation from a loved one so keenly that they try to make contact with their dead loved ones through a spiritualist medium or a New Age channeler. But the Bible specifically warns us against trying to ease the pain of death this way:<br>
“When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?”-Isaiah 8:19. <br>
Indeed, Why? The Bible clearly reveals that the dead are not conscious. The real solution to the anguish caused by separation from a loved one is the comfort that only Christ gives. Spending time communicating with Christ is the healthiest way to grow through the grieving process. Remember always, the next conscious impression that comes to those who sleep in Christ will be the sounds of the second coming of Christ to awaken the dead!<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Death robs us of almost everything. But the one thing it can’t take from us is Christ, and Christ can put everything back together again. Death will not always reign in this world. The Devil, the wicked, death, and the grave will perish in “the lake of fire” which is “the second death” (Revelation 20:14).<br>
Here are four simple suggestions for facing death unafraid:<br>
(1) Live a life of hopeful trust in Christ, and you will be prepared for death at any moment.<br>
(2) Through the power of the Holy Spirit, be obedient to Christ’s commandments, and you will be prepared for a second life in which you will never die.<br>
(3) Think of death as a short sleep from which Jesus’ voice will awaken you when He comes a second time.<br>
(4) Cherish the assurance Jesus gives us of a heavenly home with Him for all eternity.<br>
Bible truth releases a person from the fear of death because it reveals Jesus, the One whom even death could not conquer. When Jesus comes into our lives, He floods our hearts with peace:<br>
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you…. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”-John 14:27.<br>
Jesus also makes it possible for us to cope with the tragedy of losing a loved one. Jesus walked through “the valley of the shadow of death”; He knows about the dark nights we go through.<br>
‘Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that BY HIS DEATH he might destroy him who holds the power of death-that is, the devil-and FREE THOSE WHO ALL THEIR LIVES WERE HELD IN SLAVERY BY THEIR FEAR OF DEATH.”-Hebrews 2:14, 15.<br>
Dr. James Simpson, the great physician who developed anesthesia, experienced a terrible loss when his eldest child died. He grieved deeply as any parent would. But then he found his way to hope. On his beloved child’s grave he erected a marker and on it he carved these words Jesus spoke concerning His resurrection: “Nevertheless, I live.”<br>
That says it all. Personal tragedy may seem to blot out the sky sometimes; nevertheless, Jesus lives! Our hearts may be breaking; nevertheless, Jesus lives! <br>
In Christ we have hope of life after death. He is “the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25), and He promises, “Because I live, you also will live” (John 14:19). Christ is our only hope of life after death. And when Christ comes again He gives us immortality. We will never again live under the shadow of death, for we have eternal life. Have you discovered this great hope that we can cherish in our darkest moments? If you have never accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, will you do it just now?<br>

God has frequently given special messages to meet the needs of different generations: a message to help Adam and Eve after sin ruined their world, a message to the world before the cataclysm of the Flood, messages for Israel when Assyria or Babylon threatened. Jesus came with a special message for His generation, and God has sounded a special message for our day. Chapters 12 and 14 of Revelation summarize God’s special message for us today. In this DISCOVER guide and the guide that follows, we will take a look at that message.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The life and teachings of Jesus established unity of belief and close fellowship in the apostolic church that He founded. The apostles formed an intimate relationship with the risen Christ. Paul pictured that close bond as a marriage relationship:<br>
“I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.”-2 Corinthians 11:2 (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)<br>
According to Paul, the Christian church is a pure woman, the bride of Christ, a fitting symbol of Christ’s beloved church.<br>
In the Old Testament the same metaphor is used to describe Israel, God’s chosen people. God said to Israel: “as a bride you loved me” (Jeremiah 2:2); “I am your husband” (Jeremiah 3:14).<br>
The book of Revelation also speaks of the church as a woman:<br>
“A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.”-Revelation 12:1<br>
(1) The woman is “clothed with the sun.” This suggests a church shining like the sun, because of being clothed with Christ’s glorious presence. Jesus, “the light of the world” (John 8:12), shines through the members of His church, and they in turn become “the light of the world” (Matthew 5:14).<br>
(2) The woman has “the moon under her feet.” The moon represents the reflected light of the gospel in the sacrifices and ceremonies of God’s people in the Old Testament. The moon being “under her feet” suggests that the reflected light of the gospel has been superseded by Christ’s ministry.<br>
(3) The woman has “a crown of twelve stars on her head.” Stars fittingly represent the twelve apostles, noble men whose testimony about Jesus shines brilliantly to this very day.<br>
Clearly, the description of this woman indicates that John has in mind the transition from God’s people, Israel, in the Old Testament to the Christian church of the New Testament that Jesus established. The sun, moon, and stars emphasize the light-giving ministry of the Christian church in sharing the Good News.<br>

                                                   <div class="no-thumb"></div>
                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
The entrance of the woman sets the stage for a great drama:<br>
“She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.”-Revelation 12:2-5.<br>
                                                      <br>
Three key figures participate in this drama:<br>
                                                      <br>
(1)The woman, already identified as the God’s church.<br>
                                                      <br>
(2)The male child born to this woman “is snatched up to God and to his throne” and will someday “rule all nations.” Jesus is the only child ever born in this world who has been taken up to God’s throne and will someday rule all nations.<br>
                                                      <br>
(3)The dragon representing the Devil, or Satan.<br>
“And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. THE GREAT DRAGON was hurled down-that ancient serpent, CALLED THE DEVIL, OR SATAN, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.”-Revelation 12:7-9.<br>
The picture becomes clear once we understand the symbols. When the Devil and his angels “lost their place in heaven,” they were “hurled to the earth.” When Jesus was born in this world, the Devil tried to kill Jesus, the male child, as soon as He was born. He failed, and Jesus was “snatched up” to God’s throne.<br>
                                                      <br>
Satan then set out to annihilate the Christian church that Christ established. The apostle John, who wrote Revelation, saw glimpses of this great conflict between Christ and Satan raging on this earth. As the battle reaches a climax at Christ’s crucifixion, John hears a voice shout from heaven:<br>
“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.”-Revelation 12:10. (Compare John 12:31 and Luke 10:18.)<br>
                                                      <br>
Jesus won a decisive victory over Satan at the cross. Then he confirmed the certainty of the plan of “salvation” and provided “power” for resisting the cunning of Satan. “The kingdom of God” was made secure, and the Savior’s authority” to be our High Priest and King was confirmed.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Now have come the salvation” declares that history’s crowning event has arrived. The birth of Christ, the Savior of the world, has taken place (verse 5). In spite of Satan’s fierce temptations, Jesus has lived His sinless life, died and arose the victor over sin and death (verse 10). Satan has been forever defeated (verse 7-9). The Cross is magnified in its full power.<br>
                                                      <br>
The announcement, “now has come the salvation,” interests not only John, but the entire universe:<br>
“Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.”-Revelation 12:12.<br>
All heaven celebrated Jesus’ victory. Christ destroyed any claim Satan may have once had to a place in heaven, and a defeated Satan lost forever his claim to our world.<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
Before Jesus ascended to heaven He established the Christian church (symbolized by the woman). His death on the cross gave the Christian church the power to defeat Satan.<br>
“They [the Christian church] overcome him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.”-Revelation 12:11.<br>
Christ is now able to give His power, the fruit of His victory, to His church. Jesus decisively triumphed over Satan at the cross, and He now continues to triumph over Satan through His church. Three characteristics mark the triumphant church during the passing centuries of the Christian era:<br>
(1) “They overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb.” Jesus was caught up to God’s throne so He could make His blood effective in the lives of his followers. He can clear the record of our sins, save us through His shed blood (1 John 1:7), and give us power to live a healthy Christian life day by day.<br>
(2) “They did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.” “The blood of the Lamb” made them willing to die for Christ’s cause; they did not “shrink from death.” God had suffered greatly, so these Christian martyrs were also willing to suffer and die. Even children make the ultimate sacrifice. A story is told of a Christian mother who was thrown to the lions in a Roman arena because she gave her ultimate allegiance to Christ and not to the state. Her young daughter, instead of shrinking back in horror, felt a fervent devotion welling up inside. As the lions attacked her mother, she stood and cried, “I too am a Christian.” Roman officials arrested her and hurled her to the hungry beasts.<br>
(3) “They overcame him [Satan]… by the word of their testimony.” Not the words, but the word of their testimony-the testimony of their lives, their living witness to the power of Jesus and His gospel. During the darkest hours of the Christian era an army of Christians-from the early church fathers to the Protestant reformers-overcame the worst the Devil could hurl at them, simply by the dynamics witness of their lives.<br>
Revelation 12:11 pictures a victorious church filled with overcomers: apostles, martyrs, reformers, and other faithful Christians. Their kindness, faithfulness, courage, and triumph has thundered down the centuries and moved the world.<br>
Since Satan failed to destroy Jesus when He lived on earth, he now seeks to destroy the Christ who lives in His church.<br>
“When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with torrent. But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.”-Revelation 12:13-16.<br>
Just as predicted, during the Dark Ages of the Christian era, Satan sent “a river” of persecution “to sweep” the church “away with the torrent.” Satan wants to destroy Christ’s influence by wiping out His church and uses every trick his evil genius can devise. The dragon represents Satan primarily. But remember that Satan uses human institutions in his role as dragon to attack God’s people. He used the Roman king Herod in an attempt to murder the Christ child as soon as He was born. He worked through Christ’s jealous religious rivals to stalk and harass the Savior, and finally secure His execution on the cross. But Satan’s apparent victory turned into Christ’s greatest triumph.<br>
Furious over his defeat at the Cross, Satan turned his wrath against the church that Jesus established. During the decades after Christ’s crucifixion, thousand met their death in the Roman Colosseum, city squares, dungeons, and desert hideaways.<br>
At first secular authorities initiated this persecution. But after the death of the apostles a gradual change crept into the church. During the second, third, and fourth centuries, many in the church began to modify the truths Christ and His apostles had taught. Some apostate leaders even began to persecute those Christians who insisted on the purity of New Testament beliefs. <br>
Scholars estimate that about 50 million of the faithful perished. In an effort to drown out the church and destroy it, the Devil sent “a river” of persecution “to sweep her [the church] away with the torrent.” But the earth helped the woman by… swallowing the river” of persecution and false doctrine.<br>
During these medieval persecutions, the true church withdrew from the apostate leadership and took refuge in “the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days” (verse 6). This prediction was fulfilled during the 1260 years of persecution from A.D. 538 to 1798 (a day often stands for a year in symbolic Bible prophecy, see Ezekiel 4:6).<br>
During these dark centuries, faithful Bible-believing Christians found refuge wherever they could; for example, in the Waldensian valleys of western Italy and eastern France, and in the Celtic church of the British Isles.<br>

                                                   <div class="blogdate">Saturday, November 04, 2023<br></div>
                                                   <span style="color:#000000;"><br>
This brings us to our day-to the true church of Christ since 1798. As might be expected, the Dragon is still angry with God’s people. The great unseen war continues. In fact, Satan makes his greatest attack on the church just before Jesus comes.<br>
“Then the dragon [the devil] was enraged at the woman [God’s church] and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring-those who obey God’s commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.”-Revelation 12:17.<br>
This prophecy focuses on our day. Satan is enraged; he wages war on “the rest of” the woman’s “offspring”-God’s present-day people. Notice their identifying marks:<br>
                                                      <br>
(1) These last-day believers “hold to the testimony of Jesus.” Clinging faithfully to the pure doctrines of the Word of God, they testify for Jesus through dynamic Christian living.<br>
                                                      <br>
(2) These last-day Christians are a people of prophecy. Receiving “the testimony of Jesus Christ” enabled John to write the book of Revelation (Revelation 1:1-3). The final group of believers receive a similar gift: direct testimonies from God through an earthly messenger. Their gift of prophecy focuses on God’s revelation of their mission and their final destiny.<br>
                                                      <br>
(3) These last-day Christians are also identified as “those who obey God’s commandments.” They not only defend the integrity of the Ten Commandments, they also obey them. God’s love in their hearts produces joyful obedience (Romans 5:5; 13:8-10).<br>
                                                      <br>
These last-day Christians follow the example of Christ and the early church in obeying the commandments of God. This greatly provokes the Dragon-the Devil. And he wages war with “the rest of “ the woman’s “offspring” because they bear witness that love for God produces obedient disciples. As Jesus charged:<br>
“If you love me, you will obey what I command.”-John 14:15.<br>
The lives of these last-day Christians show that it’s possible to love God with all our hearts and our fellow human beings as ourselves. According to Jesus, these qualities, love for God and love for people, sum up God’s Ten Commandments (Matthew 22: 35-40).<br>
                                                      <br>
The fourth of those commandments asks us to observe Saturday, the seventh day of the week, as the Sabbath. Since a love for Jesus has imbedded all ten of the commandments in their hearts, these last-day Christians are Sabbath-keepers.<br>
The Sabbath is at the heart of God’s final message to His people in Revelation, chapters 12, and 14:6-15. All the resources of heaven are arrayed behind the last-day Christians described in these chapters. A living Savior is their constant companion, and the Holy Spirit works to “strengthen them with power in the inner man.” The promise is sure. They will overcome Satan “by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony” (Revelation 12:11).<br>
                                                      <br>
Do you wish to be one of these last-day Christians who “obey God’s commandments” and “hold to the testimony of Jesus”? Why not make that decision just now?<br>

The wages of sin is death. But God, who alone is immortal, will grant eternal life to His redeemed. Until that day death is an unconscious state for all people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected righteous and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up to meet their Lord. The second resurrection, the resurrection of the unrighteous, will take place a thousand years later. (Job 19:25-27; Ps. 146:3, 4; Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10; Dan. 12:2, 13; Isa. 25:8; John 5:28, 29; 11:11-14; Rom. 6:23; 16; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; Col. 3:4; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 20:1-10.)<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Why does the Seventh-day Adventist Church have a <em>Church Manual</em>?<br>
God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and<br>
redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church.<br>
Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church<br>
in its internal operations and in the fulfillment of its mission to the world. In<br>
order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the<br>
Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms<br>
that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40).<br>
Ellen G. White pointed out such needs in 1875: “The church of Christ<br>
is in constant peril. Satan is seeking to destroy the people of God, and one<br>
man’s mind, one man’s judgment, is not sufficient to be trusted. Christ<br>
would have His followers brought together in church capacity, observing<br>
order, having rules and discipline, and all subject one to another, esteeming<br>
others better than themselves.”—3T 445.<br>
But Church leaders did not quickly produce a book of rules for Church<br>
governance, even though the General Conference Session met annually<br>
during the Church’s early years and delegates voted on matters of church<br>
order and life. Finally, in 1882, the General Conference Session voted to<br>
have prepared “instructions to church officers, to be printed in the <em>Review</em><br>
                                                      <em>and Herald </em>or in tract form.”—RH, Dec. 26, 1882. This revealed the<br>
growing realization that order was imperative if organization was to<br>
function effectively and that uniformity in order required its guiding<br>
principles to be put into printed form.<br>
However, when the proposal to place the articles in permanent form as<br>
a church manual came before the 1883 General Conference Session,<br>
delegates rejected the idea. They feared a manual might formalize the<br>
Church and take from its pastors their individual freedom to deal with<br>
matters of order as they desired.<br>
But this fear—doubtless reflecting the opposition that had existed 20<br>
years before to any kind of organization—evidently soon lessened. The<br>
annual General Conference Sessions continued to take actions on matters of<br>
order.<br>
Though the Church officially declined to adopt a manual, leaders from<br>
time to time gathered together in book or booklet-form the generally<br>
accepted rules of church life. Perhaps the most impressive was a 184-page<br>
book published in 1907 by pioneer J. N. Loughborough entitled<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#231F20;">1<br>

of the topics now covered by this <em>Church Manual</em>.<br>
As the Church worldwide grew rapidly in the early twentieth century, it<br>
increasingly recognized the need for a manual for worldwide use by its<br>
pastors and lay members. In 1931 the General Conference Committee voted<br>
to publish a church manual. J. L. McElhany, later president of the General<br>
Conference, prepared the manuscript, which was published in 1932.<br>
The opening sentence of the preface of that first edition observed that<br>
“it has become increasingly evident that a manual on church government is<br>
needed to set forth and preserve our denominational practices and polity.”<br>
Note the word <em>preserve</em>. This was no attempt to suddenly create and<br>
impose upon the Church a whole pattern of church governance. Rather it<br>
was an endeavor first to <em>preserve </em>all the good actions taken through the<br>
years and then to add rules required by the Church’s increasing growth and<br>
complexity.<br>

describes the operation and functions of local churches and their relationship to denominational structures in which they hold membership.<br>
                                                      <br>
The <em>Church Manual </em>also expresses the Church’s understanding of Christian life and church governance and discipline based on biblical principles and the authority of duly assembled General Conference Sessions. “God has ordained that the representatives of His church from all parts of the earth, when assembled in a General Conference, shall have authority.”—9T 261.<br>
                                                      <br>
The <em>Church Manual </em>is divided into two types of material. The content<br>
of each chapter is of worldwide value and is applicable to every church<br>
organization, congregation, and member. Recognizing the need for<br>
variations in some sections, additional explanatory material, presented as<br>
guidance and examples, appears as notes at the end of the <em>Church Manual</em>.<br>
The notes have subheadings corresponding to chapter subheadings and page<br>
numbers of the main text.<br>
The standards and practices of the Church are based upon the principles<br>
of the Holy Scriptures. These principles, underscored by the Spirit of<br>
Prophecy, are set forth in this <em>Church Manual</em>. They are to be followed in<br>
all matters pertaining to the administration and operation of local churches.<br>
The <em>Church Manual </em>also defines the relationship that exists between the<br>
local congregation and the conference or other entities of Seventh-day<br>
Adventist denominational organization. No attempt should be made to set up standards of membership or to make, or attempt to enforce, rules or regulations for local church operations that are contrary to these decisions adopted by the General Conference in Session and that are set forth in this <em>Church Manual</em>.<br>

concerning the <em>Church Manual</em>. Realizing the importance of conducting the worldwide work of the Church “decently and in order,” the 1946 General Conference Session voted that “all changes or revisions of policy that are to be made in the Manual shall be authorized by the General Conference Session.”—<em>General Conference Report</em>, No. 8, p. 197 (June 14, 1946).<br>
                                                      <br>
In 1948, recognizing that local conditions sometimes call for special<br>
actions, the General Conference Committee voted that “each division,<br>
including the North American Division of the world field, prepare a ‘Supplement’ to the new <em>Church Manual </em>not in any way modifying it but<br>
containing such additional matter as is applicable to the conditions and<br>
circumstances prevailing in the division; the manuscripts for these<br>
Supplements to be submitted to the General Conference Committee for<br>
endorsement before being printed.”—<em>Autumn Council Actions</em>, 1948, p. 19.<br>
                                                      <br>
The 2000 General Conference Session authorized the reclassification of<br>
some existing <em>Church Manual </em>material into the Notes section as guidance<br>
and examples rather than mandatory material, and approved the process for<br>
making changes. Changes in the <em>Church Manual</em>, except for the notes and<br>
editorial changes, can be made only by action of a General Conference<br>
Session, where delegates of the world church have voice and vote. If a local church, conference, or union conference/mission wishes to propose a <em>Church Manual </em>revision, it should submit its proposal to the next constituent level for counsel and study. If that level approves the proposal, it submits the suggested revision to the next level for additional evaluation.<br>
                                                      <br>
If the various levels approve the proposal, it eventually comes before the<br>
General Conference <em>Church Manual </em>Committee, which considers all<br>
recommendations. If the <em>Church Manual </em>Committee approves a revision, it<br>
prepares it for presentation at an Annual Council and/or General Conference<br>
Session.<br>
Revision of a note follows the same procedure. The General<br>
Conference Executive Committee may approve changes to the notes at any<br>
Annual Council.<br>
The <em>Church Manual </em>Committee reports proposed nonsubstantive<br>
editorial changes to the main content of the <em>Church Manual </em>to an Annual<br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#231F20;">1<br>

final approval. However, in the event the Annual Council determines by<br>
one-third vote that an editorial change substantively alters the meaning of a<br>
passage, the proposed change must go to the General Conference Session.<br>
At the final Annual Council of a quinquennium, the General<br>
Conference Executive Committee reviews all changes to the notes and<br>
coordinates the changes with any proposed amendments to the main content<br>
of the <em>Church Manual</em>.<br>
A new edition of the <em>Church Manual </em>is published after every General<br>
Conference Session. The most recent edition should always be used. This<br>
edition incorporates amendments made at the 2015 General Conference<br>
Session.<br>

under General Conference <em>Working Policy </em>it may be identified as a mission,<br>
section, delegation, or field. In some world divisions, unions of churches in<br>
a particular country function as a conference for local-church purposes and<br>
as a union for other Church organizational purposes. (See Chapter 3,<br>
“Organization and Authority.”)<br>

Pastor and minister</em>—Most areas of the world Church use “pastor” to<br>
identify a member of the clergy, so that term is used in these pages rather<br>
than “minister,” regardless of the responsibilities assigned by the local<br>
conference. Use of the term here is not intended to mandate that usage<br>
where the custom is to use “minister.” Pastors referred to in this manual are<br>
those who have been appointed by the conference to oversee the affairs of<br>
the local church or district.<br>

church of God” (Acts 20:28), “the body of Christ” (Eph. 4:12), and “the<br>
church of the living God” (1 Tim. 3:15).<br>
                                                      <br>
To belong to the church of God is a unique and soul-satisfying<br>
privilege. It is God’s purpose to gather out a people from the far corners of the earth to bind them into one body, the body of Christ, of which He is the living head. All who are children of God in Christ Jesus are members of this body, and in this relationship they may enjoy fellowship with each other and fellowship also with their Lord.<br>
                                                      <br>
The Bible uses the word <em>church </em>in at least two senses: a general sense<br>
applying to the church in all the world (Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 12:28) and a<br>
particular sense applying to the church in a city or a province, such as to<br>
those at Rome (Rom. 1:6, 7), Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and Thessalonica<br>
(1 Thess. 1:1) and of Galatia (1 Cor. 16:1), Asia (1 Cor. 16:19), and Syria<br>
and Cilicia (Acts 15:41).<br>
Christ, being the head of the church and its living Lord, has a deep love<br>
for the members of His body. In the church He is to be glorified<br>
(Eph. 3:21). Through the church He will reveal the “manifold wisdom of<br>
God” (Eph. 3:10). Day by day He nourishes the church (Eph. 5:29), and His longing desire is to make of it “a glorious church, not having spot or<br>
wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish”<br>
(Eph. 5:27).<br>

there was to be no dividing wall between Israel and other nations<br>
(John 4:4-42; 10:16; Luke 9:51-56; Matt. 15:21-28). The apostle Paul<br>
writes, “The Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and<br>
partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel” (Eph. 3:6).<br>
Nor is there to be among Christ’s followers any preference of caste or<br>
nationality or race or color, for all are of one blood. The elect of God are a universal brotherhood, a new humanity, “all one in Christ Jesus”<br>
(Gal. 3:28).<br>
                                                      <br>
“Christ came to this earth with a message of mercy and forgiveness. He<br>
laid the foundation for a religion by which Jew and Gentile, black and<br>
white, free and bond, are linked together in one common brotherhood,<br>
                                                      <em>CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD 21</em><br>
recognized as equal in the sight of God. The Savior has a boundless love for<br>
every human being.”—7T 225.<br>
“No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste is recognized<br>
by God. He is the Maker of all mankind. All men are of one family by<br>
creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ came to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open every compartment of the temple, that every soul may have free access to God. . . . In Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free. All are brought nigh by His precious blood.”—COL 386.<br>

of the church” (1 Tim. 3:5), to “shepherd the church of God” (Acts 20:28),<br>
and to show “concern for all the churches” (2 Cor. 11:28).<br>
                                                      <br>
“I testify to my brethren and sisters that the church of Christ, enfeebled<br>
and defective as it may be, is the only object on earth on which He bestows His supreme regard. While He extends to all the world His invitation to come to Him and be saved, He commissions His angels to render divine help to every soul that cometh to Him in repentance and contrition, and He comes personally by His Holy Spirit into the midst of His church.”—TM 15.<br>
                                                      <br>
As the bride of Christ and the supreme object of His regard, the church<br>
is expected in all its functions to represent the order and the character of the<br>
divine.<br>
“At this time the church is to put on her beautiful garments—‘Christ<br>
our righteousness.’ There are clear, decided distinctions to be restored and<br>
exemplified to the world in holding aloft the commandments of God and the<br>
faith of Jesus. The beauty of holiness is to appear in its native luster in<br>
contrast with the deformity and darkness of the disloyal, those who have<br>
revolted from the law of God. Thus we acknowledge God, and recognize<br>
His law, the foundation of His government in heaven and throughout His<br>
earthly dominions. His authority should be kept distinct and plain before the<br>
world, and no laws are to be acknowledged that come in collision with the<br>
laws of Jehovah. If in defiance of God’s arrangements the world be allowed<br>
to influence our decisions or our actions, the purpose of God is defeated.<br>
However specious the pretext, if the church waver here, there is written<br>
against her in the books of heaven a betrayal of the most sacred trusts, and<br>
treachery to the kingdom of Christ. The church is firmly and decidedly to<br>
hold her principles before the whole heavenly universe and the kingdoms of<br>

the world; steadfast fidelity in maintaining the honor and sacredness of the<br>
law of God will attract the notice and admiration of even the world, and<br>
many will, by the good works which they shall behold, be led to glorify our Father in heaven.”—TM 16, 17.<br>
                                                      <br>
The apostle Peter writes, “But you are a chosen generation, a royal<br>
priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim<br>
the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light”<br>
(1 Peter 2:9).<br>

they may present to the world an image of His own sufficiency, and that His church may be complete in Him, a continual representation of another, even the eternal world, of laws that are higher than earthly laws. His church is to be a temple built after the divine similitude, and the angelic architect has brought his golden measuring rod from heaven, that every stone may be hewed and squared by the divine measurement and polished to shine as an emblem of heaven, radiating in all directions the bright, clear beams of the Sun of Righteousness. . . .<br>

“The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts through the<br>
exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is effecting transformations<br>
so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting, with all his<br>
confederacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government,<br>
stands viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and<br>
delusions. They are to him an incomprehensible mystery. The angels of<br>
God, seraphim and cherubim, the powers commissioned to cooperate with<br>
human agencies, look on with astonishment and joy that fallen men, once<br>
children of wrath, are through the training of Christ developing characters<br>
after the divine similitude, to be sons and daughters of God, to act an<br>
important part in the occupations and pleasures of heaven.<br>
“To His church, Christ has given ample facilities, that He may receive a<br>
large revenue of glory from His redeemed, purchased possession. The<br>
church, being endowed with the righteousness of Christ, is His depository,<br>
in which the wealth of His mercy, His love, His grace, is to appear in full<br>
and final display. . . .<br>
“In their untainted purity and spotless perfection, Christ looks upon His<br>
people as the reward of all His suffering, His humiliation, and His love, and<br>
the supplement of His glory—Christ, the great center from which radiates<br>

His peculiar people, He provided for them an impressive system of<br>
organization to govern their conduct in both civil and religious matters.<br>
“The government of Israel was characterized by the most thorough<br>
organization, wonderful alike for its completeness and its simplicity. The<br>
order so strikingly displayed in the perfection and arrangement of all God’s created works was manifest in the Hebrew economy. God was the center of authority and government, the sovereign of Israel. Moses stood as their visible leader, by God’s appointment, to administer the laws in His name.<br>
                                                      <br>
From the elders of the tribes a council of seventy was afterward chosen to<br>
assist Moses in the general affairs of the nation. Next came the priests, who<br>
consulted the Lord in the sanctuary. Chiefs, or princes, ruled over the tribes.<br>
Under these were ‘captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and<br>
captains over fifties, and captains over tens,’ and, lastly, officers who might<br>
be employed for special duties.”—PP 374.<br>
The New Testament church showed the same perfection in its<br>
organization. Christ Himself, who formed the church (Matt. 16:18), “set the<br>
members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased” (1 Cor. 12:18).<br>
He endowed them with gifts and talents adequate for the functions<br>
devolving upon them and organized them into a living, working body, of<br>
which He is the head.<br>
“For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do<br>
not the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and<br>
individually members of one another” (Rom. 12:4, 5). “And He [Christ] is<br>
the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from<br>
the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence” (Col. 1:18).<br>
“There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences<br>
of ministries, but the same Lord” (1 Cor. 12:4, 5). “For as the body is one<br>
                                                      <em>ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY 25</em><br>
and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ” (1 Cor. 12:12). “Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues” (1 Cor. 12:27, 28).<br>

are organically united and functioning together, so there can be no living,<br>
growing, prospering church unless its members are organized into a united spiritual body, all performing their God-given duties and functions under the direction of a divinely constituted authority. Without organization no institution or movement can prosper. A nation without organized government would be chaos. A business enterprise without organization would fail. A church without organization would disintegrate and perish.<br>
                                                      <br>
For the sake of the Church’s healthy development and for the<br>
accomplishment of its task of carrying the gospel of salvation to all the<br>
world, Christ gave it a simple but effective system of organization. Success<br>
in its endeavors to achieve its mission depends on loyal adherence to this<br>
divine pattern.<br>
“Some have advanced the thought that as we near the close of time,<br>
every child of God will act independently of any religious organization. But<br>
I have been instructed by the Lord that in this work there is no such thing as<br>
every man’s being independent.”—TM 489.<br>
“Oh, how Satan would rejoice if he could succeed in his efforts to get<br>
in among this people and disorganize the work at a time when thorough<br>
organization is essential and will be the greatest power to keep out spurious uprisings and to refute claims not endorsed by the Word of God! We want to hold the lines evenly, that there shall be no breaking down of the system of organization and order that has been built up by wise, careful labor.<br>
                                                      <br>
License must not be given to disorderly elements that desire to control the work at this time.”—TM 489.<br>

organization there would be great confusion, and the work would not be<br>
carried forward successfully. To provide for the support of the ministry, for carrying the work in new fields, for protecting both the churches and the ministry from unworthy members, for holding church property, for the<br>
publication of the truth through the press, and for many other objects,<br>
organization was indispensable.”—TM 26.<br>
                                                      <br>
“As members of the visible church, and workers in the vineyard of the<br>
Lord, all professed Christians should do their utmost to preserve peace,<br>
harmony, and love in the church. Mark the prayer of Christ: ‘That they all<br>
may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.’ The unity of the church is the convincing evidence that God has sent Jesus into the world as its Redeemer.”—5T 619, 620.<br>

world (Matt. 28:19, 20; Mark 16:15) meant not only preaching the gospel<br>
but ensuring the welfare of those who accepted that message. This involved shepherding as well as housing the flock, and also meeting relationship problems. Such a situation called for organization.<br>
                                                      <br>
At first the apostles constituted a council that directed the activities of<br>
the church from Jerusalem (Acts 6:2; 8:14). When the company there<br>
became so large that the administration of its practical affairs became a<br>
problem, the church appointed deacons to care for its business (Acts 6:2-4).<br>
                                                      <br>
Later other congregations grew up, not only in Asia but also in Europe,<br>
and this called for further organizational steps. In Asia Minor elders were<br>
ordained “in every church” (Acts 14:23). Extension of the work throughout the various provinces of the Roman Empire called for organization of churches into what might be called conferences (Gal. 1:2). Thus, step by step, organization grew in the early church. As needs arose, God directed the leaders of His work so that, in counsel with the church, they developed a form of organization that safeguarded the interests of the work.<br>

recognizes that authority rests in the membership and is expressed through duly elected representatives at each level of organization, with executive responsibility delegated to representative bodies and officers for the governing of the Church at each separate level. The <em>Church Manual </em>applies this principle of representation to the operations of the local congregation.<br>
                                                      <br>
Issues of representation in organizations with mission status are defined by operating policies and in organizations with conference status by their<br>
constitution and bylaws. This form of governance recognizes also that<br>
ordination to the ministry is recognized by the Church worldwide.<br>
“Every member of the church has a voice in choosing officers of the<br>
church. The church chooses the officers of the state conferences. Delegates<br>
chosen by the state conferences choose the officers of the union<br>
conferences, and delegates chosen by the union conferences choose the<br>
officers of the General Conference. By this arrangement every conference,<br>
every institution, every church, and every individual, either directly or<br>
through representatives, has a voice in the election of the men who bear the<br>
chief responsibilities in the General Conference.”—8T 236, 237.<br>
The present organizational system of the Church resulted from a<br>
developing theological understanding of the mission of the Church,<br>
membership growth, and the Church’s geographic spread. Representatives<br>
of conferences met in 1863 to organize the General Conference of<br>
Seventh-day Adventists.<br>
There are several organizational levels within the Church leading from<br>
the individual believer to the worldwide organization of the work.<br>
Membership units in each of these levels periodically convene formal<br>
business sessions known as constituency meetings or sessions. (The<br>
constituency meeting or session of a local church is generally referred to as a business meeting.) In Seventh-day Adventist Church structure, no<br>
organization determines its own status, nor does it function as if it had no obligations to the Church family beyond its boundaries.<br>

5. General Conference and Its Divisions—The General Conference<br>
represents the worldwide expression of the Church. Its constituent<br>
membership is defined in its Constitution. To facilitate its worldwide<br>
activity, the General Conference has established regional offices, known as<br>
divisions of the General Conference, which have been assigned, by action<br>
of the General Conference Executive Committee at Annual Councils,<br>
general administrative oversight for designated groups of unions and other<br>
Church units within specific geographical areas.<br>
The Bible is the foundation and source of belief and practice; on this<br>
basis, the General Conference in Session determines the stated fundamental<br>
beliefs of the Church. The General Conference in Session also authorizes<br>
establishment of unions and the attachment of field units, revises the<br>
                                                      <em>Church Manual</em>, elects General Conference and division leadership,<br>
performs other functions as outlined in its Constitution and Bylaws, and<br>
considers items referred to it by its Executive Committee. The General<br>
Conference Executive Committee between Sessions is empowered by the Constitution and Bylaws to act on behalf of the constituents. Thus Church organizations around the world recognize the General Conference in<br>
Session as the voice of the Church.<br>

God alone is the source of authority for the Church. He delegated authority to His prophets and apostles (2 Cor. 10:8). They, therefore, occupied a crucial and unique position in the transmission of the Word of God and the edification of the church (Eph. 2:20).<br>
                                                      <br>
The early church bore responsibility for purity in doctrine and practice.<br>
The elders (or bishops) held great authority. One of their main functions<br>
was general pastoral care and oversight (Acts 20:17-28; Heb. 13:17;<br>
1 Peter 5:1-3), with special tasks such as giving instruction in sound<br>
doctrine and refuting those who contradicted it (1 Tim. 3:1, 2; Titus 1:5, 9).<br>
They were instructed to “test the spirits, whether they are of God”<br>
(1 John 4:1) or, in Paul’s terms, to “test all things” and “hold fast what is<br>
good” (1 Thess. 5:21).<br>
                                                      <br>
The same was true regarding its exercise of discipline (Matt. 18:15-17),<br>
which ranged from private and caring admonition (cf. Matt. 18:16; Gal. 6:1) to removal from membership (Matt. 18:18; 1 Cor. 5:11, 13; 2 Cor. 2:5-11).<br>
                                                      <br>
The Church thus has authority to settle the rules for its own<br>
governance.<br>

Conference Executive Committee between Sessions, is the highest<br>
ecclesiastical authority in the administration of the Church. The General<br>
Conference Executive Committee is authorized by its Constitution to create subordinate organizations with authority to carry out their roles. Therefore all subordinate organizations and institutions throughout the Church will recognize the General Conference Session, and the General Conference Executive Committee between Sessions, as the highest ecclesiastical authority, under God, among Seventh-day Adventists.<br>

When differences arise in or between churches and conferences or<br>
institutions, matters that are not mutually resolved may be appealed to the<br>
next higher organization. If the matter does not get resolved at this level, the<br>
aggrieved entity may appeal to successively higher levels of organization.<br>
An organization to which an appeal is forwarded may choose not to hear the<br>
matter, in which case the decision of the highest organization involved in<br>
the dispute shall be final. When organizations review decisions of other<br>

organizations, they do not assume responsibility for the liabilities of any<br>
other organization.<br>
“I have often been instructed by the Lord that no man’s judgment<br>
should be surrendered to the judgment of any other one man. Never should<br>
the mind of one man or the minds of a few men be regarded as sufficient in<br>
wisdom and power to control the work and to say what plans shall be<br>
followed. But when, in a General Conference, the judgment of the brethren<br>
assembled from all parts of the field is exercised, private independence and private judgment must not be stubbornly maintained, but surrendered. <br>
                                                      <br>
Never should a laborer regard as a virtue the persistent maintenance of his position of independence, contrary to the decision of the general body.”—9T 260.<br>

gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. . . . ’<br>

“Men appointed of God have been chosen to watch with jealous care,<br>
with vigilant perseverance, that the church may not be overthrown by the<br>
evil devices of Satan, but that she shall stand in the world to promote the<br>
glory of God among men.”—TM 52, 53.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Conference President</em></strong>—The conference president should be an<br>
ordained pastor of experience and good report. He stands at the head of the<br>
gospel ministry in the conference and is the chief elder, or overseer, of all<br>
the churches. He works for their spiritual welfare and counsels them<br>
regarding their activities and plans. He has access to all the churches and<br>
their services, business meetings, and boards, without vote unless granted<br>
by the church, or unless he is a member of that congregation. He may, by<br>
virtue of his office, preside over any meeting of any church when necessary.<br>
He has access to all church records.<br>
The conference president does not have authority to set aside the duly<br>
elected officers of the church, but will work in cooperation with them. They<br>
in turn are bound, in recognition of the ties of conference fellowship, to<br>
counsel with him over all that pertains to the welfare of the church. They<br>
should not attempt to exclude him from a proper discharge of his duties.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Conference Departmental Directors</em></strong>—Conference departmental<br>
directors foster important lines of denominational work under the general<br>
direction of the conference committee in consultation with the conference<br>
president. In order to successfully carry on the work assigned to them, these<br>
employees must have access to the churches so they can present and<br>
develop their plans. These employees will have sympathetic consideration<br>
for all church plans, even outside their respective departments.<br>
Departmental directors are not vested with administrative or executive<br>
authority, so their relation to local churches is advisory. Their work does<br>
not bear the same relationship to the churches as that of the conference<br>
committee or president. In the promotion of their specific kinds of work,<br>
they labor throughout the entire conference. However, they are not expected<br>
to counsel churches regarding elections and other administrative duties or<br>
any other line of service, unless especially requested to do so by the<br>
conference president.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Ordained Pastors</em></strong>—Ordained pastors appointed by the conference<br>
committee to act as pastors or district leaders do not take the place of the<br>
president in their respective fields. They are not charged with administrative<br>
powers as is the president, but they cooperate with him in carrying out the<br>
plans and policies of the conference.<br>
On assignment to a local church, the ordained pastor is assisted by the<br>
local elders. By virtue of ordination, the pastor is qualified to function in all<br>
rites and ceremonies. The pastor should be the congregation’s spiritual<br>
leader and adviser. Pastors should instruct the officers in their duties and<br>
plan with them for all lines of church work and activity.<br>
The pastor is a member of the church board and serves as its<br>
chairperson. If the pastor desires to be relieved of the responsibility of<br>
acting as chairperson of the board, an elder serves as chairperson in<br>
cooperation with the pastor. (See p. 74.) The pastor, with the assistance of<br>
the elders, is expected to plan for and lead out in all spiritual services, such<br>
as Sabbath morning worship and prayer meeting, and should officiate at the<br>
communion service and baptism. Pastors should not surround themselves<br>
with any special body of counselors of their own choosing, but always<br>
cooperate with the elected officers.<br>
When an evangelist is asked to conduct an evangelistic effort where<br>
there is a church, the conference should invite the pastor to assist the<br>
evangelist, thus giving the pastor an opportunity to become acquainted with<br>
prospective members.<br>
Pastors or assistant pastors are not nominated or elected to such<br>
positions by the church. Their connection with the church is by appointment<br>
of the conference committee, and such appointments may be changed at any<br>
time. (See p. 74.)<br>
A pastor may be removed from office by conference committee action<br>
without the individual’s church membership being affected. But when a<br>
pastor is removed from church membership and subsequently restored to<br>
membership as a layperson, the pastor’s membership restoration does not<br>
mean restoration to the ministry.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Licensed Pastors</em></strong>—To give individuals an opportunity to demonstrate<br>
their call to the ministry, especially in the area of soul winning, prospective<br>
candidates are granted pastoral licenses by the conference. The granting of<br>
such licenses confers the opportunity to develop the ministerial gift.<br>
Licensed pastors are authorized to preach, to engage in evangelism, to<br>
lead out in outreach (missionary) work, and to assist in all church activities.<br>
There are circumstances, however, where it is necessary for the<br>
conference to appoint a licensed pastor to carry responsibility as a pastor or<br>
assistant pastor of a church or group of churches. In order to open the way<br>
for a licensed pastor to perform certain pastoral functions, the church or<br>
group of churches being served must elect the pastor as a local elder. Then,<br>
since the right to permit the extension of a licensed pastor’s authority rests<br>
first with the division executive committee, it must approve the extension<br>
by specifically and clearly defining the additional functions that that<br>
licensed pastor may perform. The extended functions are limited only to the<br>
church or group of churches where the pastor is assigned and is an elder.<br>
After the division committee acts, the conference committee may act.<br>
(See p. 74.)<br>
The conference committee shall not extend the functions of a licensed<br>
pastor beyond what has been authorized by the division committee. It also<br>
shall not authorize a licensed pastor to perform the extended functions in<br>
any church beyond where the licensed pastor is assigned and is an elder. A<br>
conference committee action cannot be substituted for church election or<br>
ordination to gospel ministry.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Bible Instructors</em></strong>—The conference may employ Bible instructors and<br>
assign them to work with evangelistic efforts or with local congregations.<br>
Though the instructors work under the general direction of the conference,<br>
an instructor assigned to an evangelistic effort works under the direction of<br>
the evangelist conducting the campaign, and an instructor assigned to a<br>
church works under the direction of the pastor. An instructor should not,<br>
except by special arrangement with the conference, be asked to carry a<br>
church office, but should be left free to carry on soul-winning work.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Conference Directs Church Employees</em></strong>—The conference president<br>
in counsel with the conference committee directs all conference employees,<br>
                                                      <em>34 CHURCH MANUAL</em><br>
such as pastors, Bible instructors, and departmental directors, who receive<br>
their credentials from and are responsible to the conference, not the local<br>
church. A church may ask the conference president for the services or help<br>
of conference employees, but appointments in all cases rest with the<br>
conference committee. The conference committee may change employee<br>
assignments whenever it believes they are needed. The employee or the<br>
church may appeal to the conference committee for a hearing on the<br>
decision to remove the employee, and the committee will carefully consider<br>
the appeal in light of the needs of the entire conference. If the employee<br>
refuses to cooperate with the committee and declines to work in harmony with its decisions, the committee may regard the employee’s conduct as insubordination and may deal with it accordingly. In no case should the employee appeal to the church regarding such decisions. If a local church supports an employee’s refusal to cooperate, it also becomes subject to conference discipline.<br>

In a local conference, the committee confers authority upon individuals<br>
to represent the Church as pastors and gospel workers. This authority is<br>
represented by the granting of credentials and licenses, which are written<br>
commissions, properly dated and signed by the officers of the conference.<br>
The authority thus conveyed is not personal or inherent in the individual but<br>
is inherent in the granting body, which may recall the credentials for cause<br>
at any time. Credentials and licenses granted employees are not their<br>
personal property and must be returned when employment is terminated or<br>
at the request of the organization that issued them.<br>
No one should be allowed to speak to any congregation unless he/she<br>
has been invited by the church in harmony with guidelines given by the<br>
conference. It is recognized, however, that there are times when<br>
congregations may be addressed by government officials or civic leaders;<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">A church is organized by an ordained pastor on the recommendation of<br>
the conference executive committee. (For the procedure for organizing a<br>
company, see pp. 37, 38.) Since so much is involved in the organization of a church, the local conference president should be invited to be present.<br>
                                                      <br>
When a company of baptized believers is prepared to assume the<br>
responsibilities of an organized church, it must consult with the conference president and obtain approval from the conference executive committee prior to seeking a date for the organization to take place.<br>
When the baptized believers assemble on the agreed-upon date, the<br>
individual officiating should first present a brief review of the fundamental<br>
beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists.<br>
Then the one presiding should make a call asking all who are in<br>
agreement with these principles and who desire to unite in church<br>
fellowship to come forward. The name of each person should be recorded.<br>
If any are already members of the conference church or another<br>
congregation, the one officiating should present the letters of transfers they<br>
have secured. Those transferring form the nucleus of the congregation.<br>
If, however, there are no transferring members, then three members<br>
(preferably established Sabbathkeepers among those present) should be<br>
selected as a nucleus. They may be asked these questions: Do you accept<br>
Christ as your personal Savior? Are you in full harmony with the principles<br>
of faith that have just been presented? Have you been baptized by<br>
immersion? Are you in regular standing and enjoying one another’s<br>
confidence?<br>
If they answer these questions in the affirmative, the three are declared<br>
the nucleus of the new church. Then one after another the names that were<br>
recorded are called, each person is asked the questions listed in the<br>
preceding paragraph, and the presiding person takes a vote among the<br>
nucleus to receive each individual into church fellowship. Each person thus<br>
received becomes a member of the church and is qualified to vote on the<br>
next name. Care should be taken to see that full fellowship and brotherly<br>
love exist among those received into membership. Should any difficulty<br>
arise in any case over a question either of doctrine or of fellowship, action<br>
should be deferred unless the matter can be adjusted kindly and tactfully.<br>
When the nucleus has voted on all potential members, the church is a<br>
complete entity and ready for election of officers. Members then should<br>
choose a nominating committee, with the officiating pastor serving as<br>
chairperson. The nominating committee brings in nominations to fill the<br>
various church offices. When these have been elected, the elders should be<br>
ordained, unless they have already been ordained as elders. A similar but<br>
shorter service should take place for ordination of deacons and deaconesses.<br>
The church then is fully organized and ready for service.<br>
Before the organizing meeting ends, the members should vote to<br>
request the conference to receive the newly organized church into the<br>
sisterhood of churches at the next conference session.<br>
To maximize success of the new congregation, conference and local<br>
leaders should see that all officers are fully instructed concerning their<br>
duties. The church also should have the materials needed for the<br>
communion service, which, if possible, should be celebrated as part of the<br>
organizational meeting. The treasurer, the clerk, and the other officers<br>
should receive all the necessary records or equipment needed to carry out<br>
their responsibilities.<br>

they belong to a small group, house church, or church planting core group,<br>
they should consider forming a company of believers for fellowship,<br>
worship, and mission with the objective of growing into an organized<br>
church or multiplying house churches in that geographical area.<br>
Company status is approved by vote of the conference committee,<br>
which, should it become necessary, may subsequently dissolve the<br>
company. The division and/or conference should have written guidelines for<br>
organizing companies within its territory.<br>
Church members who are part of small groups or house groups may<br>
form the nucleus of a new company. Membership of all those who want to<br>
be part of a company should be held in either the conference church or a<br>
local church (mother church). If membership for those who want to be part<br>
of a company is to be held in the conference church, the conference<br>
committee will vote their membership transfers to the conference church<br>
and indicate that they are part of the new company.<br>
When the conference committee approves establishment of a company,<br>
a leadership team should be appointed, including a leader, a clerk, and a<br>
treasurer. The appointment should be carried out by the district pastor, or<br>
other pastor appointed by the conference committee, in counsel with the<br>
group being established as a company.<br>
All other company appointments should be made by vote of those who<br>
are part of the group that is forming the company. The district pastor or<br>
other person authorized by the conference committee shall preside at such a<br>
meeting. Only members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in regular<br>
standing shall be appointed.<br>
The leader of a company shall not be ordained to that office and does<br>
not have the authority to perform those functions that are vested in an elder<br>
of a church. However, where exceptional circumstances warrant, the<br>
conference committee may appoint a person of church experience and<br>
leadership ability to serve as elder of the company.<br>
The clerk of the company shall keep record of all activities and<br>
meetings of the company and shall send regular statistical reports to the<br>
mother church or the conference executive secretary. These reports should<br>
include statistics on attendance and activities of the company, including<br>
outreach ministries conducted during the week or on Sabbath.<br>
The treasurer of the company shall keep record of all money received<br>
and disbursed and shall send promptly, at the time established by the<br>
conference, all tithes and offerings, other than funds collected for local<br>
purposes, to the conference treasurer, who also is treasurer of the<br>
conference church.<br>
If the members of an organized company are members of the<br>
conference church, the company does not possess the right to administer<br>
discipline or transfer or receive members. All such matters must be referred<br>
to the conference committee, which constitutes the board of the conference<br>
church. The conference president is the elder of the conference church.<br>
If the conference organizes a company through a neighboring mother<br>
church instead of through the conference church, the functions listed above (such as reporting and membership) would be cared for by/through the mother church.<br>
                                                      <br>
Since a company should want to grow and eventually be recognized as<br>
a church, its leadership should prepare members for church status by<br>
promoting all activities generally carried on by a church.<br>

should recommend such a course. In a duly called meeting, presided over by the conference president or the pastor or other ordained pastor, each church should vote on the question of union. When favorable action has been taken by both churches, a joint meeting of the two churches should be arranged, with the conference president presiding or in his absence an ordained pastor appointed by the conference.<br>
                                                      <br>
A carefully written statement of agreement should be prepared setting<br>
forth the reasons for uniting and stating any special matters or conditions<br>
involved, such as the disposal of property and responsibility for financial<br>
obligations. It should provide for the new name of the united church and for<br>
the release from service of all officers of the two churches.<br>
Adoption of the agreement by the united body consummates the union<br>
of the two churches. Members of the new congregation then should choose<br>
a nominating committee to nominate officers to serve for the remainder of<br>
the current year.<br>
A copy of the agreement should then be filed with the conference.<br>
The entire membership of both churches unites in the new organization.<br>
It is not permissible to remove any members by failing to include them in<br>
the membership list at the time of uniting. The united body becomes<br>
responsible for the order and discipline of all members. Members under<br>
discipline should be dealt with as provided elsewhere in this manual.<br>
All records of both churches become a part of the records of the united<br>
body. The local conference should be notified so that it may take suitable actions at its next session.<br>

sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He<br>
might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle<br>
or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. . . . For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church. For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones” (Eph. 5:25-30).<br>
                                                      <br>
This spirit should permeate all efforts to help an erring church and all<br>
aspects of any discipline that may be applied—always to help and save for<br>
the cause of God.<br>
Church status is not necessarily perpetual. A church may be dissolved<br>
or expelled from the sisterhood of churches for the following reasons:<br>
                                                      <br>
1. <strong><em>Loss of Members</em></strong>—Occasionally, despite efforts to preserve a<br>
church, so many members are lost by moving away or by death or by<br>
apostasy that the existence of the church is threatened. Under such<br>
circumstances the conference committee should recommend possible<br>
dissolution of the church.<br>
Before a church takes final action to dissolve, the remaining members<br>
shall be invited to transfer their memberships to other churches.<br>
If enough members remain, the congregation may call a business<br>
meeting, presided over by the conference president or by a pastor<br>
designated by him, to vote to approve letters requesting transfer of all<br>
members in regular standing to unite with other churches. In this way the<br>
church dissolves itself upon recommendation of the conference committee,<br>
and the way is opened for the conference committee to take action recording<br>
dissolution of the church.<br>
If, in the judgment of the conference committee, there are too few<br>
members available to call a business meeting, the conference committee<br>
shall have the authority to recommend transfer of members in regular<br>
standing to other churches or to the conference church. In this way the<br>
church is dissolved.<br>
If at the time of dissolution there are members who are under discipline<br>
and therefore cannot be granted letters saying they are in regular standing,<br>
their memberships shall be provisionally held in the conference church<br>
while conference administration ensures that every effort is made as soon as<br>
possible to help such members to a satisfactory Christian experience. If the<br>
efforts are successful, their memberships may then be confirmed in the<br>
conference church or letters granted to them for transfer to other churches.<br>
If they cannot be reclaimed, they should be removed from membership by<br>
vote of the conference committee.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. <strong><em>Discipline</em></strong>—Occasions for expelling churches for disciplinary<br>
reasons are rare because the mission of the church is to seek and to save.<br>
Where serious problems such as apostasy, refusal to operate in harmony<br>
with the <em>Church Manual</em>, or rebellion against the conference persist, earnest<br>
efforts should be made to avert the need for expulsion. The pastor should<br>
seek to deepen the spiritual life of the church through preaching and<br>
personal visitation ministries. The conference should encourage a series of<br>
revival meetings to lead the members to renew their covenant with their<br>
Lord. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the pastor, in cooperation with the<br>
conference committee, should counsel with the church and its leadership,<br>
seeking to bring healing and reconciliation and to preserve the church.<br>
Such remedial measures are preferable to permitting the deterioration<br>
of relationships, which could lead to expulsion of the church.<br>
However, if all efforts to preserve the church fail, the conference<br>
committee should give careful study to the question of expulsion. If such<br>
action is decided upon, the conference shall follow the following procedure:<br>
a. The decision to recommend expulsion, with supporting<br>
reasons, shall be presented to the church itself in a business meeting for its<br>
information and consideration.<br>
b. If the church does not accept the recommendation, it may<br>
respond in one of the following ways:<br>
1) Eliminating the causes for discipline and accepting the<br>
conference specifications, request the conference to rescind the<br>
recommendation to dissolve or expel.<br>
2) Appeal to the union executive committee, or to the<br>
division in case of a union of churches, to arbitrate on behalf of the church.<br>
c. If the church remains in rebellion, the conference executive<br>
committee makes a recommendation to a regular or specially called<br>
constituency meeting that the church be dissolved.<br>
d. If the constituency takes action to expel, the conference shall<br>
enforce the decision.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Care of Members, Records, and Funds</strong><br>
Loyal members of a dissolved or expelled church may desire to retain<br>
their memberships in the Church. To ensure their welfare, their<br>
memberships shall be provisionally held for up to one year in the<br>
conference church to allow opportunity for those who desire to have their<br>
memberships in the conference church confirmed or transferred to another<br>
church. Their standing shall be evaluated by the conference committee, and,<br>
if satisfactory, the conference committee may recommend them for<br>
membership in the conference church or churches of their choice.<br>
The names of members of a dissolved or expelled church who are<br>
under discipline shall be referred to the conference secretary for early<br>
attention by the conference committee as set out in “Loss of Members,”<br>
above.<br>
On dissolution or expulsion of a church for loss of members or for<br>
disciplinary reasons, all offerings, financial accounts, and all property real<br>
or personal, whether held in the name of the local church or the conference<br>
or other denominational legal association, are held in trust for the<br>
conference. The conference therefore has the right, the authority, and the<br>
duty to administer, protect, or dispose of such property and funds. All<br>
records of the church are to be held in the custody of the conference<br>
secretary and/or treasurer.<br>
In cases where discipline is not involved, an alternative to dissolving or<br>
expelling a church is to return it to company status. Such a decision will be<br>
made by a majority vote of the conference committee, following<br>
consultation with the district pastor and members, and conveyed to the<br>
church by the pastor or conference representative.<br>
At a business meeting (see pp. 40, 41), letters of transfer may be voted<br>
to all remaining members in regular standing to the conference church or to<br>
other churches in the cases of any members who wish to transfer. At the<br>
same meeting, the pastor, in counsel with the local members, shall appoint from the members of the new company a leadership team, including a leader, a clerk, and a treasurer. For details of other organizational matters relating to a company, see “Organizing a Company” on pp. 37, 38.<br>

impressed on everyone desiring Church membership. Only those giving<br>
evidence of having experienced the new birth and enjoying a spiritual<br>
experience in the Lord Jesus are prepared for acceptance into membership. <br>
                                                      <br>
Pastors must instruct candidates in the fundamental teachings and related practices of the Church so they will enter the Church on a sound spiritual basis. While there is no stated age for baptism, it is recommended that very young children who express a desire to be baptized should be encouraged and entered into an instruction program that may lead to baptism.<br>
The apostle Paul writes: “Or do you not know that as many of us as<br>
were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we<br>
were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was<br>
raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk<br>
in newness of life” (Rom. 6:3, 4).<br>
Luke also reports: “Then Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and let every one<br>
of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.’ . . . Then those who gladly<br>
received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls<br>
were added to them” (Acts 2:38-41).<br>
“The members of the church, those whom He has called out of darkness<br>
into His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory. The church is the<br>
repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church will<br>
eventually be made manifest, even to ‘the principalities and powers in<br>
heavenly places,’ the final and full display of the love of God.”—AA 9.<br>

of entrance to His spiritual kingdom. He has made this a positive condition with which all must comply who wish to be acknowledged as under the authority of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. . . .<br>
“Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who are<br>
baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, at<br>
the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that they have<br>
forsaken the service of Satan and have become members of the royal<br>
family, children of the heavenly King. They have obeyed the command:<br>
‘Come out from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the<br>
unclean thing.’ And to them is fulfilled the promise: ‘I will receive you, and<br>
will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the<br>
Lord Almighty.’ 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.”—6T 91.<br>
Baptism is the avenue of induction into the Church. It is fundamentally<br>
the pledge of entrance into Christ’s saving covenant and should be treated<br>
as a solemn and yet joyful welcome into the family of God.<br>
Membership in the Church is possible only in those churches included<br>
in the sisterhood of churches recognized by a conference.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Mode of Baptism</em></strong>—The Church believes in baptism by immersion and<br>
accepts into membership only those who have been baptized in this manner.<br>
(See Chapter 14, “Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists.”) Those<br>
who acknowledge their lost state as sinners, sincerely repent of their sins,<br>
and experience conversion may, after proper instruction, be accepted as<br>
candidates for baptism and Church membership.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Thorough Instruction and Public Examination Before Baptism</em></strong>—<br>
Candidates individually or in a baptismal class should be instructed from<br>
the Scriptures regarding the Church’s fundamental beliefs and practices and<br>
the responsibilities of membership. A pastor should satisfy the church by a<br>
public examination that candidates are well instructed, are committed to<br>
taking this important step, and by practice and conduct demonstrate a<br>
willing acceptance of Church doctrines and the principles of conduct which<br>
are the outward expression of those doctrines, for “by their fruits you will<br>
know them” (Matt. 7:20).<br>
If public examination is impractical, then candidates should be<br>
examined by the board or a committee appointed by the board, such as the<br>
board of elders, whose report then should be given to the church before the<br>
baptism.<br>
“The test of discipleship is not brought to bear as closely as it should be<br>
upon those who present themselves for baptism. It should be understood<br>
whether they are simply taking the name of Seventh-day Adventists, or<br>
whether they are taking their stand on the Lord’s side, to come out from the<br>
world and be separate, and touch not the unclean thing. Before baptism<br>
there should be a thorough inquiry as to the experience of the candidates.<br>
                                                      <br>
Let this inquiry be made, not in a cold and distant way, but kindly, tenderly, pointing the new converts to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. Bring the requirements of the gospel to bear upon the candidates for baptism.”—6T 95, 96.<br>

A printed copy of this covenant, with the Certificate of Baptism and<br>

membership by baptism. An appropriate certificate also should be given<br>
those accepted on profession of faith.<br>
The Certificate of Baptism and Commitment contains a space for the<br>

in the presence of the church membership or other properly appointed body,<br>

baptism of converts, an evangelist should invite the pastor or elder to visit<br>
the baptismal class to become acquainted with the candidates. Such contacts<br>
will enable the church to be better prepared to receive the new members.<br>

should make necessary preparations and also assist male candidates into and<br>
out of the water. The deaconesses should assist female candidates.<br>
Care should be exercised to see that proper attire is provided for the<br>
candidates, preferably robes of suitable heavy material. If robes are not<br>
available, the candidates should dress in modest attire.<br>
The baptism should be followed by a short welcoming ceremony.<br>

Rebaptism is specifically mentioned only in Acts 19:1-7, where the<br>
apostle Paul endorsed it for a group of believers whose previous baptism of<br>
repentance had been by John. In addition to repentance, Christian baptism is<br>
associated with an understanding of and personal commitment to the gospel<br>
and the teachings of Jesus and a reception of the Holy Spirit. With this<br>
increased understanding and commitment, rebaptism is acceptable.<br>

grounds, individuals from other Christian communions who have embraced<br>
Seventh- day Adventist beliefs and who have previously been baptized by<br>
immersion may request rebaptism.<br>
The following examples, however, suggest that rebaptism may not be<br>
required. Evidently the instance of Acts 19 was a special one, for Apollos is<br>
reported to have received John’s baptism (Acts 18:25), and there is no<br>
record that he was rebaptized. Apparently some of the apostles themselves<br>
received John’s baptism (John 1:35-40), but there is no record they were<br>
rebaptized.<br>
If a new believer has accepted significant new truths, Ellen G. White<br>
supports rebaptism as the Spirit leads the new believer to request it. This<br>
follows the developmental pattern of Acts 19. An individual who has<br>
previously experienced baptism by immersion should evaluate his/her new<br>
religious experience and determine whether he/she desires rebaptism. There<br>
is to be no urging.<br>
“This [rebaptism] is a subject which each individual must<br>
conscientiously take his position upon in the fear of God. This subject<br>
should be carefully presented in the spirit of tenderness and love. Then the<br>
duty of urging belongs to no one but God; give God a chance to work with<br>
His Holy Spirit upon the minds, so that the individual will be perfectly<br>
convinced and satisfied in regard to this advanced step.”—Ev 373.<br>

apostolic church (Heb. 6:4-6), Scripture does not address the question of<br>
rebaptism. Ellen G. White supports rebaptism when members have<br>
apostatized and then are reconverted and wish to rejoin the Church.<br>
(See pp. 66, 67, 154.)<br>

“The Lord calls for a decided reformation. And when a soul is truly<br>
reconverted, let him be rebaptized. Let him renew his covenant with God,<br>
and God will renew His covenant with him.”—Ev 375.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Inappropriate Rebaptism</em></strong>—On the basis of biblical teaching and the<br>
guidance of Ellen G. White, rebaptism should occur only in special<br>
circumstances and should be relatively rare. To administer baptism<br>
repeatedly or on an emotional basis lessens its meaning and represents a<br>
misunderstanding of the gravity and significance that Scripture assigns to it.<br>
A member whose spiritual experience has become cold needs a spirit of<br>
repentance which leads to revival and reformation. This experience will be<br>
followed by participation in the communion service to signify renewed<br>
cleansing and fellowship in the body of Christ, making rebaptism<br>
unnecessary.<br>

                                                      <strong>Profession of Faith</strong><br>
Individuals who have accepted the fundamental beliefs of the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church and who desire membership in the Church<br>
on profession of faith may be accepted under any of the following four<br>
circumstances:<br>
1. A committed Christian coming from another Christian communion<br>
who has already been baptized by immersion as practiced by the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church. (See p. 44.)<br>
2. A member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who, because of<br>
world conditions, is unable to secure a letter of transfer from his/her home<br>
church. (See p. 53.)<br>
3. A member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church whose request for<br>
membership transfer has received no response from the church where he/she<br>
is a member. In such a case the church shall seek assistance of the<br>
conference or conferences involved.<br>
4. An individual who has been a member, but whose membership has<br>
been misplaced or has been withdrawn because he/she was a missing<br>
member, yet who has remained faithful to his/her Christian commitment.<br>
Great care should be exercised in receiving members if they have<br>
formerly been members of another congregation. When a person applies for<br>
membership on profession of faith, inquiries should be made concerning the<br>
applicant’s former experience. Church officers should seek the advice and<br>
help of the conference president. Sufficient time should be taken to<br>
investigate the facts.<br>
                                                      <em>MEMBERSHIP 51</em><br>
When a person applies for membership on profession of faith and it is<br>
found that he/she still is a member of another congregation, no steps should<br>
be taken to receive that person into membership until the church holding the<br>
membership grants a letter of transfer. If, after the process of transfer is<br>
followed (see pp. 51, 52), a church refuses to grant a letter of transfer and<br>
the member feels the letter has been unjustly denied, the member may<br>
appeal to the conference committee. Following this procedure will result in<br>
a higher appreciation of the sacredness of Church membership and in<br>
wrongs being made right. No church has the right to withhold transfer<br>
unless the person is under discipline.<br>
When an individual whose membership has been removed seeks<br>
readmission to church membership, readmission is normally preceded by<br>
rebaptism. (See pp. 67, 68.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Transferring Members</strong><br>
When members move to a different area, the clerk of the church<br>
holding their membership records should write to the secretary of the<br>
relevant conference requesting that a pastor in the new locality visit them<br>
and help facilitate their membership transfer to the new congregation.<br>
The clerk of the church holding the membership records also should<br>
notify the transferring members of the intention to give their new addresses<br>
to the conference.<br>
Members who move to another locality for longer than six months<br>
should make immediate applications for letters of transfer. Members<br>
moving to an isolated area with no church within a reasonable distance<br>
should apply to join the conference church.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Method of Granting Letters of Transfer</em></strong>—Members should apply<br>
for their letters of transfer to the clerk of the church with which the<br>
members desire to unite (the receiving church). That clerk sends the request<br>
to the clerk of the church from which the members desire to transfer (the<br>
granting church). (For alternative method, see p. 52.)<br>
When the clerk of the granting church receives the request, the clerk<br>
brings it to the pastor or elder, who in turn presents it to the board. After<br>
due consideration, the board votes to recommend, favorably or otherwise, to<br>
the church. (See pp. 36-38, 40, 49-55, 65-68, 82.) The pastor or elder then<br>
brings the recommendation to the attention of the church for a first reading.<br>
Final action is taken the following week, when the request is presented to<br>
the church for a vote.<br>
The purpose of the one-week interval is to give members an<br>
opportunity to object to the granting of the letter. Objections ordinarily<br>
should not be publicly stated but be lodged with the pastor or elder, who<br>
then refers them to the board for consideration. The board should give each<br>
objector opportunity to appear to present his/her objection. If the objection<br>
is not based on valid grounds, the person raising objection should be<br>
admonished to withdraw it. If the objection is based on valid grounds, it is<br>
the duty of the board to investigate. Final action on granting the letter is<br>
deferred until the matter has been satisfactorily settled.<br>
If the objection involves personal relationships, every effort should be<br>
made to effect reconciliation. If public offenses are involved, disciplinary<br>
measures may be called for. If there is some spiritual lapse, efforts should<br>
be made to restore the member.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Clerk to Prepare Letter</em></strong>—When the church has granted the letter of<br>
transfer, the clerk fills out the regular transfer form and forwards it to the<br>
clerk of the receiving church. The clerk of the receiving church then passes<br>
the letter to the pastor or elder, who presents it first to the board for<br>
recommendation, after which the request is presented to the church at its<br>
next regular service. The vote accepting the person into membership usually<br>
is taken at the regular service one week later. The clerk of the receiving<br>
church then adds the member’s name and date of admittance to the<br>
membership record. The clerk also fills out the return portion of the letter of<br>
transfer, certifying that the member has been accepted, and returns it to the<br>
clerk of the granting church. (See p. 82.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Letter Valid Six Months</em></strong>—A letter of transfer is valid for six months<br>
from date of issue.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Alternative Method for Membership Transfer</em></strong>—A division may<br>
approve alternative methods for transferring members between churches<br>
within the division, but when members request transfers to a church in<br>
another division, the above “Method of Granting Letters of Transfer” must<br>
be followed.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Membership During Transfer</em></strong>—Under no circumstances shall the<br>
clerk of the granting church remove a member’s name from the membership<br>
record until the return portion of the transfer letter has been received,<br>
certifying that the member has been voted into the fellowship of the<br>
receiving church. To do so deprives the person of membership during the<br>
transfer. The clerk, the elders, the pastor, and the conference president are<br>
all responsible for seeing that all churches adhere to this procedure.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Receiving Members Under Difficult Conditions</em></strong>—World conditions<br>
sometimes prevent communications concerning a membership transfer. In<br>
such situations, the receiving church, in counsel with the conference, should<br>
satisfy itself as to the applicant’s standing and then receive him/her into<br>
membership on profession of faith. If the way later opens to communicate<br>
with the granting church or to the conference where it is located, the<br>
receiving church should send a letter stating what it has done.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Counted in Statistical Reports</em></strong>—When quarterly and annual<br>
statistical reports are made, a member to whom a letter has been granted,<br>
but whose return certificate has not been received, is counted as a member<br>
of the granting church. When the return certificate has been received, the<br>
name is then removed from the membership record of the granting church<br>
and not included in subsequent reports.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>If Member Is Not Accepted</em></strong>—The receiving church must receive the<br>
member unless it knows a valid reason it should not extend the privilege of<br>
membership. If a church does not receive the member, the clerk should<br>
return the letter to the granting church with a full explanation of the reasons.<br>
The person’s membership then remains with the granting church, which<br>
should cooperate with the member to resolve the matter.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Letters Granted Only to Those in Regular Standing</em></strong>—Letters of<br>
transfer are granted only to members in regular standing, never to a member<br>
under discipline. Qualifying statements are out of order except when the<br>
pastor or board of the granting church has factual or proven knowledge that<br>
the member has been involved as a perpetrator of child abuse. In that case,<br>
for the safety of children, the pastor or elder should provide a confidential<br>
statement alerting the pastor or elder of the congregation to which the<br>
member is transferring.<br>
If a member who has moved to a new location has grown indifferent,<br>
the pastor or elder of the granting church may, to be clear in the matter<br>
before the transfer is granted, take up the question with the pastor or elder<br>
of the receiving church.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>No Letter Without Member’s Approval</em></strong>—In no case should a church<br>
vote a letter of transfer contrary to the desire of the member, nor should a<br>
                                                      <em>54 CHURCH MANUAL</em><br>
church accept a member by a letter granted under such circumstances.<br>
Membership is the personal relationship of an individual to the body of<br>
Christ, and a church should recognize this relationship and avoid any action<br>
that might be construed as arbitrary.<br>
On the other hand, a member is under obligation to recognize the<br>
welfare of the church and to make every effort to relieve the church of<br>
problems incident to absentee members. When a member moves, he/she<br>
should promptly request a letter of transfer.<br>
When a church is expelled from the sisterhood of churches by action of<br>
a conference session, the memberships of all loyal members, except those<br>
who refuse, are considered moved to the conference church on a provisional<br>
basis. The conference church then may issue letters of transfer for loyal<br>
members and deal with other memberships as may be necessary. (See<br>
pp. 39-42.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Church Board Cannot Grant Letters</em></strong>—A board has no authority to<br>
vote letters of transfer or to receive members by letter. The board’s<br>
authority is limited to making recommendations to the church. Action on all<br>
transfers of membership, favorable or otherwise, must be taken by the<br>
church. (See pp. 51, 52.) The clerk has no authority to remove names from<br>
or add names to the membership record except by vote of the church, unless<br>
a member requests in writing to be removed from church membership, in<br>
which case the church board must act on the request. Efforts should be<br>
made to restore the individual to the church family. When a member dies,<br>
the clerk records the date of death in the membership record, and no action<br>
by the church is necessary.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Membership in the Conference Church</em></strong>—Isolated members should<br>
unite with the conference church, which is a body organized for the benefit<br>
of believers who otherwise would be without church privileges. Aged and<br>
infirmed members who live near a church and conference officers and other<br>
employees, including pastors, should be members of a local church, not the<br>
conference church.<br>
The conference president is the presiding elder of the conference<br>
church, and the work normally carried by the clerk and the treasurer is<br>
handled by the conference secretary and treasurer. Since the church has no<br>
board, all business normally conducted by a local church board is conducted<br>
by the conference committee, which also appoints delegates from the<br>
conference church to the conference session.<br>
                                                      <strong><em><br>
Membership Record</em></strong>—The church should have one membership<br>
record. Names are added or removed only on the vote of the church or at<br>
death. (See pp. 81, 82.) Under no circumstances should a church keep a retired membership list.<br>

against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that ‘by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.’ And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a<br>
tax collector. Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be<br>
bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven”<br>
(Matt. 18:15-18).<br>
“In dealing with erring church members, God’s people are carefully to<br>
follow the instruction given by the Savior in the eighteenth chapter of<br>
Matthew.<br>
“Human beings are Christ’s property, purchased by Him at an infinite<br>
price, bound to Him by the love that He and His Father have manifested for<br>
them. How careful, then, we should be in our dealing with one another!<br>
Men have no right to surmise evil in regard to their fellow men. Church<br>
members have no right to follow their own impulses and inclinations in<br>
dealing with fellow members who have erred. They should not even express<br>
their prejudices regarding the erring, for thus they place in other minds the<br>
leaven of evil. . . .<br>
“ ‘If thy brother shall trespass against thee,’ Christ declared, ‘go and<br>
tell him his fault between thee and him alone.’ . . . Do not tell others of the<br>
wrong. One person is told, then another, and still another; and continually<br>
the report grows, and the evil increases, till the whole church is made to<br>
suffer. Settle the matter ‘between thee and him alone.’ This is God’s<br>
plan.”—7T 260.<br>

change the plan that God has made for the settlement of misunderstandings<br>
and personal injuries. Speaking alone and in the spirit of Christ to the one<br>
who is in fault will often remove the difficulty. Go to the erring one, with a<br>
heart filled with Christ’s love and sympathy, and seek to adjust the matter.<br>
Reason with him calmly and quietly. Let no angry words escape your lips.<br>
Speak in a way that will appeal to his better judgment. Remember the<br>
words: ‘He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save<br>
a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.’ James 5:20. . . .<br>
“All heaven is interested in the interview between the one who has<br>
been injured and the one who is in error. As the erring one accepts the<br>
reproof offered in the love of Christ, and acknowledges his wrong, asking<br>
forgiveness from God and from his brother, the sunshine of heaven fills his<br>
heart. . . . The Spirit of God binds heart to heart, and there is music in<br>
heaven over the union brought about. . . .<br>
“ ‘But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that<br>
in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.’. . .<br>
Take with you those who are spiritually minded, and talk with the one in<br>
error in regard to the wrong. . . . As he sees their agreement in the matter,<br>
his mind may be enlightened.<br>
“ ‘And if he shall neglect to hear them,’ what then shall be done? Shall<br>
a few persons in a board meeting take upon themselves the responsibility of<br>
disfellowshiping the erring one? ‘If he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto<br>
the church.’ . . . Let the church take action in regard to its members.<br>
“ ‘But if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an<br>
heathen man and a publican.’ . . . If he will not heed the voice of the church,<br>
if he refuses all the efforts made to reclaim him, upon the church rests the<br>
responsibility of separating him from fellowship. His name should then be<br>
stricken from the books.<br>
“No church officer should advise, no committee should recommend,<br>
nor should any church vote, that the name of a wrongdoer shall be removed<br>
from the church books, until the instruction given by Christ has been<br>
faithfully followed. When this instruction has been followed, the church has<br>
cleared herself before God. The evil must then be made to appear as it is,<br>
and must be removed, that it may not become more and more widespread.<br>
The health and purity of the church must be preserved, that she may stand<br>
before God unsullied, clad in the robes of Christ’s righteousness. . . .<br>
“ ‘Verily I say unto you,’ Christ continued, ‘whatsoever ye shall bind<br>
on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth<br>
shall be loosed in heaven.’ . . .<br>
“This statement holds its force in all ages. On the church has been<br>
conferred the power to act in Christ’s stead. It is God’s instrumentality for<br>
the preservation of order and discipline among His people. To it the Lord<br>
has delegated the power to settle all questions respecting its prosperity,<br>
purity, and order. Upon it rests the responsibility of excluding from its<br>
fellowship those who are unworthy, who by their un-Christlike conduct<br>
would bring dishonor on the truth. Whatever the church does that is in<br>
accordance with the directions given in God’s Word will be ratified in<br>
heaven.”—7T 261-263.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Authority of the Church</em></strong>—“The world’s Redeemer has invested great<br>
power with His church. He states the rules to be applied in cases of trial<br>
with its members. After He has given explicit directions as to the course to<br>
be pursued, He says: ‘Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on<br>
earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever [in church discipline] ye<br>
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.’ Thus even the heavenly<br>
authority ratifies the discipline of the church in regard to its members when<br>
the Bible rule has been followed.<br>
“The Word of God does not give license for one man to set up his<br>
judgment in opposition to the judgment of the church, neither is he allowed<br>
to urge his opinions against the opinions of the church.”—3T 428.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Church’s Responsibility</em></strong>—“God holds His people, as a body,<br>
responsible for the sins existing in individuals among them. If the leaders of<br>
the church neglect to diligently search out the sins which bring the<br>
displeasure of God upon the body, they become responsible for these<br>
sins.”—3T 269.<br>
“If there were no church discipline and government, the church would<br>
go to fragments; it could not hold together as a body.”—3T 428.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Unconsecrated Resist Discipline</em></strong>—“There are many who do not<br>
have the discretion of Joshua and who have no special duty to search out<br>
wrongs and to deal promptly with the sins existing among them. Let not<br>
such hinder those who have the burden of this work upon them; let them not<br>
stand in the way of those who have this duty to do. Some make it a point to<br>
question and doubt and find fault because others do the work that God has<br>
not laid upon them. These stand directly in the way to hinder those upon<br>
whom God has laid the burden of reproving and correcting prevailing sins<br>
in order that His frown may be turned away from His people. Should a case<br>
like Achan’s be among us, there are many who would accuse those who<br>
might act the part of Joshua in searching out the wrong, of having a wicked,<br>
fault-finding spirit. God is not to be trifled with and His warnings<br>
disregarded with impunity by a perverse people. . . .<br>
“Those who work in the fear of God to rid the church of hindrances and<br>
to correct grievous wrongs, that the people of God may see the necessity of<br>
abhorring sin and may prosper in purity, and that the name of God may be<br>
glorified, will ever meet with resisting influences from the<br>
unconsecrated.”—3T 270, 271.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Safeguarding Unity of the Church</em></strong>—Christians should make every<br>
effort to avoid tendencies that would divide them and bring dishonor to<br>
their cause. “It is the purpose of God that His children shall blend in unity.<br>
Do they not expect to live together in the same heaven? . . . Those who<br>
refuse to work in harmony greatly dishonor God.”—8T 240. The church<br>
should discourage actions that threaten harmony among its members and<br>
should consistently encourage unity.<br>
Although all members have equal rights within the church, no<br>
individual member or group should start a movement or form an<br>
organization or seek to encourage a following for the attainment of any<br>
objective or for the teaching of any doctrine or message not in harmony<br>
with the fundamental religious objectives and teachings of the Church. Such<br>
a course would result in the fostering of a divisive spirit, the fragmenting of<br>
the witness of the Church, and thus in hindering of the Church’s discharge<br>
of its obligations to the Lord and the world.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Reconciliation of Differences</em></strong>—Every effort should be made to settle<br>
differences among church members and contain the controversy within the<br>
smallest possible sphere. Reconciliation of differences within the church<br>
should, in most cases, be possible without recourse either to a conciliation<br>
process provided by the Church or to civil litigation.<br>
“If matters of difficulty between brethren were not laid open before<br>
others, but frankly spoken of between themselves in the spirit of Christian<br>
love, how much evil might be prevented! How many roots of bitterness<br>
whereby many are defiled would be destroyed, and how closely and<br>
tenderly might the followers of Christ be united in His love!”—TMB 59.<br>
(See p. 58.)<br>
“Contentions, strife, and lawsuits between brethren are a disgrace to the<br>
cause of truth. Those who take such a course expose the church to the<br>
ridicule of her enemies and cause the powers of darkness to triumph. They<br>
are piercing the wounds of Christ afresh and putting Him to an open shame.<br>
By ignoring the authority of the church they show contempt for God, who<br>
gave to the church its authority.”—5T 242, 243.<br>
Civil litigation is often carried on in a spirit of contention that results<br>
from and reveals human selfishness. It is this kind of adversarial<br>
proceedings that must be discouraged by a church that seeks to exhibit the<br>
spirit of Christ. Christian unselfishness will lead followers of Christ to<br>
suffer themselves to be defrauded (1 Cor. 6:7) rather than to “go to law<br>
before the unrighteous, and not before the saints” (1 Cor. 6:1).<br>
While there are, in the modern world, occasions for seeking decrees of<br>
civil courts, Christians should prefer settlement within the authority of the<br>
Church and should limit the seeking of such decrees to cases that are clearly<br>
within the jurisdiction of the civil courts and not within the authority of the<br>
Church or for which the Church agrees it has no adequate process for<br>
orderly settlement. Such suits before civil courts should never become<br>
revengeful adversary proceedings but should develop out of a desire to seek<br>
arbitration and to settle differences amicably.<br>
Examples of such civil cases may include, but are not limited to, the<br>
settlement of insurance claims, the issuance of decrees affecting the<br>
boundaries and ownership of real property, the deciding of some matters<br>
involving the administration of estates, and the awarding of custody of<br>
minor children.<br>
While the Church should set up procedures within the constraints of<br>
legal practice to avoid the type of litigation referred to in 1 Corinthians 6, it<br>
should constantly be on guard against turning from its gospel mission and<br>
taking up the duties of a civil magistrate. (See Luke 12:13, 14 and<br>
9T 216-218.)<br>
God’s ideal for members of His Church is that they should, as far as<br>
possible, “live peaceably with all men” (Rom. 12:18). The Church should<br>
use its readily accessible and reasonably prompt process by which many<br>
differences among members can be settled. Should the Church fail to<br>
respond to a request for help in reconciling a difference, or if the Church<br>
acknowledges that the nature of the case is such that it is not within its<br>
authority, it should be recognized that the member has exhausted the<br>
possibilities of the biblically outlined procedure for the settlement of<br>
differences and that what he/ she should do beyond that point is a matter for<br>
his/her conscience. (See <em>The SDA Bible Commentary</em>, vol. 6, p. 698.)<br>
However, when the Church, endeavoring to assist in timely and<br>
amicable settlement of differences among its members, recommends a<br>
solution, members should not summarily reject the recommendation. As<br>
1 Corinthians 6:7 indicates, it is no light matter for a member, outside the<br>
orderly processes of the Church, to litigate a grievance against another<br>
member.<br>
                                                      <em>DISCIPLINE 61</em><br>
Members who demonstrate impatience and selfishness by their<br>
unwillingness to wait for and accept recommendations of the Church in the<br>
settlement of grievances against other church members may properly be<br>
subject to the discipline of the church (see pp. 58, 59) because of the<br>
disruptive effect on the Church and their refusal to recognize properly<br>
constituted Church authority.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Settlement of Grievances of Members Against the Church</em></strong>—The<br>
same principles that influence resolution of differences among members<br>
apply to the settlement of grievances of members against Church<br>
organizations and institutions.<br>
Members should not instigate litigation against any Church entity<br>
except under circumstances where the Church has not provided adequate<br>
process for orderly settlement of the grievance or where the nature of the<br>
case is such that it is clearly not within the authority of the Church to settle.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Settlement of Grievances of the Church Against Members</em></strong>—At<br>
times Church organizations or institutions may have grievances against<br>
members. In such circumstances, Church administrators must, in Christian<br>
forbearance, keep in mind the biblical counsel for settling disputes among<br>
Christians and apply that counsel to the settlement of grievances of the<br>
Church against its members. The Church should, in preference to litigating<br>
matters in a secular court, make every reasonable effort in cooperation with<br>
the member to provide a process by which orderly settlement of the<br>
problem can be accomplished.<br>
The Church recognizes the need of exercising great care to protect the<br>
highest spiritual interests of its members, to ensure fair treatment, and to<br>
safeguard the name of the Church. It cannot afford to deal lightly with such<br>
sins or permit personal considerations to affect its actions, and at the same<br>
time it must strive to reclaim and restore those who err.<br>
“If the erring one repents and submits to Christ’s discipline, he is to be<br>
given another trial. And even if he does not repent, even if he stands outside<br>
the church, God’s servants still have a work to do for him. They are to seek<br>
earnestly to win him to repentance. And, however aggravated may have<br>
been his offense, if he yields to the striving of the Holy Spirit and, by<br>
confessing and forsaking his sin, gives evidence of repentance, he is to be forgiven and welcomed to the fold again. His brethren are to encourage him in the right way, treating him as they would wish to be treated were they in his place, considering themselves lest they also be tempted.”—7T 263.<br>

                                                      <br>
1. Denial of faith in the fundamentals of the gospel and in the<br>
fundamental beliefs of the Church or teaching doctrines contrary to the<br>
same.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. Violation of the law of God, such as worship of idols, murder,<br>
stealing, profanity, gambling, Sabbathbreaking, and willful and habitual<br>
falsehood.<br>
                                                      <br>
3. Violation of the commandment of the law of God, which reads,<br>
“You shall not commit adultery” (Ex. 20:14, Matt. 5:27-28), as it relates to the marriage institution and the Christian home, biblical standards of moral conduct, and any act of sexual intimacy outside of a marriage relationship and/or non-consensual acts of sexual conduct within a marriage, whether those acts are legal or illegal. Such acts include but are not limited to child sexual abuse, including abuse of the vulnerable. Marriage is defined as a public, lawfully binding, monogamous, heterosexual relationship between one man and one woman.<br>
                                                      <br>
4. Fornication, which includes among other issues, promiscuity,<br>
homosexual activity, incest, sodomy, and bestiality.<br>
                                                      <br>
5. The production, use, or distribution of pornographic material.<br>
                                                      <br>
6. Remarriage of a divorced person, except the spouse who has<br>
remained faithful to the marriage vow in a divorce for adultery or for sexual perversions.<br>
                                                      <br>
7. Physical violence, including violence within the family.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      <br>
9. Disorderly conduct which brings reproach upon the church.<br>
                                                      <br>
10. Adherence to or taking part in a divisive or disloyal movement or<br>
organization. (See p. 59.)<br>
                                                      <br>
11. Persistent refusal to recognize properly constituted church<br>
authority or to submit to the order and discipline of the church.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                      <br>

human consumption.<br>
                                                      <br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>

disciplinary measures must be taken:<br>
                                                      <br>
1. By a vote of censure.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. By a vote to remove from membership.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Discipline by Censure</em></strong>—In cases where the offense is not considered<br>
by the church to be so serious as to warrant the extreme course of removing membership, the church may express its disapproval by a vote of censure.<br>
                                                      <br>
Censure has two purposes: (1) To enable the church to express its<br>
disapproval of a grievous offense that has brought disgrace upon the cause<br>
of God and (2) to impress offending members with the need for a change of<br>
life and reformation of conduct and to give them a period of grace and<br>
probation during which to make those changes.<br>
A vote of censure is for a stated period of from a minimum of one<br>
month to a maximum of 12 months. It terminates an erring member’s<br>
election or appointment to all offices and removes the privilege of election<br>
while it is in effect. Members under censure have no right to participate by<br>
voice or by vote in the affairs of the church or lead church activities, such as<br>
teaching a Sabbath School class. They are not deprived, however, of the<br>
privilege of sharing the blessings of Sabbath School, church worship, or<br>
communion. Membership may not be transferred during the period of<br>
censure.<br>
Votes of censure must not carry any provision involving removal of<br>
membership in case of failure to comply with any condition imposed.<br>
Assessment should be made at the expiration of the period of censure to<br>
determine whether the disciplined members have changed course. If their<br>
conduct is satisfactory, they may then be considered in regular standing<br>
without further action and shall be notified that the censure has ended. If<br>
their conduct is not satisfactory, the church again should consider<br>
appropriate discipline. Any return to church office must be by election.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Discipline by Removal From Membership</em></strong>—Removing individuals<br>
from membership in the church, the body of Christ, is the ultimate<br>
discipline that the church can administer. Only after the instruction given in<br>
this chapter has been followed, after counsel from the pastor or the<br>
conference when the pastor is unavailable, and after all possible efforts have<br>
been made to win and restore them to right paths, should an individual be<br>

                                                      <strong><em>No Additional Tests of Fellowship</em></strong>—No minister, congregation, or<br>
conference has authority to establish tests of fellowship. This authority rests<br>
with the General Conference Session. Anyone seeking to apply tests other<br>
than those herein set forth does not, therefore, properly represent the<br>
Church. (See 1T 207.)<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Timeliness of Discipline</em></strong>—The church must care for the disciplinary<br>
process within a reasonable time and then communicate its decisions with<br>
kindness and promptness. Delay in administering discipline may increase<br>
the frustration and suffering of the member and the church itself.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Caution About Judging Character and Motive</em></strong>—“Christ has plainly<br>
taught that those who persist in open sin must be separated from the church,<br>
but He has not committed to us the work of judging character and motive.<br>
He knows our nature too well to entrust this work to us. Should we try to<br>
uproot from the church those whom we suppose to be spurious Christians,<br>
we should be sure to make mistakes. Often we regard as hopeless subjects<br>
the very ones whom Christ is drawing to Himself. Were we to deal with<br>
these souls according to our imperfect judgment, it would perhaps<br>
extinguish their last hope. Many who think themselves Christians will at<br>
last be found wanting. Many will be in heaven who their neighbors<br>
supposed would never enter there. Man judges from appearance, but God<br>
judges the heart. The tares and the wheat are to grow together until the<br>
harvest; and the harvest is the end of probationary time. There is in the<br>
Savior’s words another lesson, a lesson of wonderful forbearance and tender<br>
love. As the tares have their roots closely intertwined with those of the good<br>
grain, so false brethren in the church may be closely linked with true<br>
disciples. The real character of these pretended believers is not fully<br>
manifested. Were they to be separated from the church, others might be<br>
caused to stumble, who but for this would have remained steadfast.”—<br>

sufficient cause, but only at a properly called business meeting (see p. 128)<br>
after the church board has reviewed the case. The meeting must be presided<br>
over by an ordained pastor, or licensed pastor who is ordained as a local<br>
elder of the church concerned, or, in the pastor’s absence and in counsel<br>
with the pastor or with the conference president, an elder of the local<br>

otherwise disciplined only by a majority vote of members present and<br>
voting at a duly called meeting. “The majority of the church is a power<br>
which should control its individual members.”—5T 107.<br>

recommend to a business meeting the removal of members, but under no<br>
circumstance does the board have the right to take final action. Except in the<br>
case of the death of members, the clerk can remove a name from the records<br>
only after a vote of the church in a business meeting.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Fundamental Rights of the Members</em></strong>—Members have a<br>
fundamental right to prior notification of the disciplinary meeting and the<br>
right to be heard in their own defense, introduce evidence, and produce<br>
witnesses. No church should vote to discipline a member under<br>
circumstances that deprive the member of these rights. Written notice must<br>
be given at least two weeks before the meeting and include the reasons for<br>
the disciplinary hearing.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Lawyers Not to Represent Members</em></strong>—The work of the Church in its<br>
administration of order and discipline is an ecclesiastical function that in no<br>
sense has to do with civil or legal procedure. Therefore, the Church does not<br>
recognize the right of members to bring legal counsel to represent them in<br>
any meeting called to administer order or discipline or for the transaction of<br>
any other church business. Members wanting to bring legal counsel into a<br>
meeting should be informed that they will not be given a hearing if they<br>
insist on bringing legal counsel.<br>
The church also should exclude all nonmembers from any church<br>
meeting called for the administration of church order or discipline, except<br>
when they are called as witnesses.<br>

into membership persons who are under censure of another congregation,<br>
because that would condone the offenses for which the members have been<br>
disciplined. The acceptance into membership of those under discipline is<br>
such a serious violation of Church policy that an offending church may be<br>
subject to discipline by the conference constituency.<br>

should faithfully visit absentee members and encourage them to resume<br>
attendance and to enjoy the blessings of worship with the congregation.<br>
When because of age, infirmity, or other unavoidable cause members<br>
find it impossible to attend worship services regularly, they should keep in<br>
contact with church leaders by letter or other means. However, as long as<br>
members are loyal to the doctrines of the Church, nonattendance shall not<br>
be considered sufficient cause for removal from membership.<br>

move, they should inform the clerk or elder of their new address. While<br>
remaining members of that church, they should report and send their tithe<br>
and offerings at least quarterly. If, however, members move without leaving<br>
a forwarding address and make no effort to contact or report to the church,<br>
and the church cannot locate them for at least two years, then the church<br>
may certify that it has tried without success to locate the members and the<br>
members may be removed by a vote of the church. The clerk should record<br>
in the membership record: “Whereabouts unknown. Voted to designate as<br>
missing.”<br>

members should support the work of the Church to the extent they are able,<br>
they should never be removed because of their inability or failure to<br>
contribute financially to the Church.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Removing Members at Their Request</em></strong>—Great care should be<br>
exercised in dealing with members who request to be removed from<br>
membership.<br>
The Church recognizes the right of the individual to withdraw<br>
membership. Letters of resignation shall be presented to the board, where<br>
the resignation will be recorded with the effective date according to the<br>
resignation letter. Out of Christian consideration for the individuals<br>
involved, action shall be taken without public discussion. Efforts should be<br>
made to restore the individual to the church family.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Notification to Those Removed From Membership</em></strong>—A church<br>
removing members must notify them in writing of the action taken but with<br>
the assurance of enduring spiritual interest and personal concern. This<br>
communication should, where possible, be delivered in person by the pastor<br>
or by a board designee. The former members should be assured that the<br>
church hopes they will return to the church and that one day there will be<br>
eternal fellowship together in the kingdom of God.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Reinstating Those Previously Removed From Membership</em></strong>—<br>
When persons have been removed for discipline, the church should, where<br>
possible, maintain contact and manifest the spirit of friendship and love,<br>
endeavoring to bring them back to the Lord.<br>
Those previously removed may be received again into membership<br>
when confession of wrongs committed is made, evidence is given of real<br>
repentance and change of life, and the life is consistent with Church<br>
standards and it is clear that the member will fully submit to Church order<br>
and discipline. Such reinstatement should preferably be in the church from<br>
which the member was dismissed. However, when this is not possible, the<br>
church where the person is requesting reinstatement must seek information<br>
from the former church about the reasons for which the person was<br>
removed from membership.<br>
When dealing with perpetrators of sexual abuse, it should be<br>
remembered that restoration to membership does not remove all<br>
consequences of such a serious violation. While attendance at church<br>
activities may be permissible with properly established guidelines, a person<br>
convicted or disciplined for sexual abuse should not be placed in a role<br>
which could put them in contact with children, youth, and other vulnerable<br>
individuals. Neither shall they be given any position which would<br>
encourage vulnerable individuals to trust them implicitly.<br>
Because removal from membership is the most serious form of<br>
discipline, the period of time before members may be reinstated should be<br>
sufficient to demonstrate that the issues which led to removal from<br>
membership have been resolved beyond reasonable doubt. It is expected<br>
that readmission to membership will be done in connection with rebaptism.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Right of Appeal for Reinstatement</em></strong>—While it is the right of the<br>
church to administer discipline, this does not set aside the rights of members<br>
to seek fairness. If members believe that they have been treated unfairly by<br>
the local church, or not had the right to be heard fairly, and the church is<br>
unwilling to reconsider the case or if the officers refuse to consider their<br>
applications for reinstatement, the former members have a right to appeal in<br>
writing to the church for a hearing. The church should not neglect or refuse<br>
to grant such hearings. If it does, or if the former members still feel unfairly<br>
treated by the church after the appeal, they have the right to a final appeal<br>
for a hearing to the executive committee of the conference.<br>
If, after a full and impartial hearing, the conference committee is<br>
satisfied that an injustice has been inflicted by the church, the committee<br>
may recommend reinstatement to membership. But if membership is still refused by the church, then the conference committee may recommend membership in some other church. On the other hand, if it finds good grounds for sustaining the church in refusing to reinstate the former members, it will so record its decision.<br>

“Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to<br>

“The Thessalonian believers were greatly annoyed by men coming<br>
among them with fanatical ideas and doctrines. Some were ‘disorderly,<br>
working not at all, but . . . busybodies.’ The church had been properly<br>
organized, and officers had been appointed to act as ministers and deacons.<br>
But there were some, self-willed and impetuous, who refused to be<br>
subordinate to those who held positions of authority in the church. They<br>
claimed not only the right of private judgment, but that of publicly urging<br>
their views upon the church. In view of this, Paul called the attention of the<br>
Thessalonians to the respect and deference due to those who had been<br>
chosen to occupy positions of authority in the church.”—AA 261, 262.<br>
“Those who hold responsible positions in the church may have faults in<br>
common with other people and may err in their decisions; but<br>
notwithstanding this, the church of Christ on earth has given to them an<br>

themselves. Their influence is not good. The church is in trouble continually<br>
in consequence of the defective character of the leader. Hands have been<br>

arisen among us men who profess to be the servants of Christ, but whose<br>
work is opposed to that unity which our Lord established in the church.<br>
They have original plans and methods of labor. They desire to introduce<br>
changes into the church to suit their ideas of progress and imagine that<br>
grand results are thus to be secured. These men need to be learners rather<br>
than teachers in the school of Christ. They are ever restless, aspiring to<br>
accomplish some great work, to do something that will bring honor to<br>
themselves. They need to learn that most profitable of all lessons, humility<br>
and faith in Jesus. . . .<br>

move in accordance with their own strong traits of character, refusing to<br>
yoke up with others who have had a long experience in the work of God,<br>
will become blinded by self-confidence, unable to discern between the false<br>
and the true. It is not safe for such ones to be chosen as leaders in the<br>
church; for they would follow their own judgment and plans, regardless of<br>
the judgment of their brethren. It is easy for the enemy to work through<br>

church as strong spiritual leaders and must have good reputations both in the church and community. In the absence of a pastor, elders are the<br>
spiritual leaders of the church and by precept and example must seek to lead the church into a deeper and fuller Christian experience.<br>
                                                      <br>
Elders should be able to conduct the services of the church and minister<br>
in both word and doctrine when the assigned pastor is unavailable.<br>
However, elders should not be chosen primarily because of social position or speaking ability, but because of their consecrated lives and leadership abilities.<br>
                                                      <br>
Elders may be reelected, but it is not advisable for them to serve<br>
indefinitely. The church is under no obligation to reelect and may choose<br>
others whenever changes seem advisable. Upon the election of new elders,<br>
the former elders no longer function as elders but may be elected to other<br>
church offices.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Ordination of Elders</strong>—Election to the office of elder does not in<br>
itself qualify one as an elder. Ordination is required before an elder has<br>
authority to function. Between election and ordination, the elected elder<br>
may function as church leader but not administer the ordinances of the<br>
church.<br>
The ordination service is performed only by an ordained pastor<br>
currently credentialed by the conference. As a courtesy, a visiting ordained<br>
pastor may be invited to assist. However, only on the specific request of<br>
conference officers would a visiting ordained pastor or a retired ordained<br>
pastor conduct the ordination.<br>
The sacred rite of ordination should be simply performed in the<br>
presence of the church and may include a brief outline of the office of elder,<br>
the qualities required, and the principal duties the elder will be authorized to<br>
perform. After the exhortation, the ordained pastor, assisted by other<br>
ordained pastors and/or local elders who are participating in the service,<br>
will ordain the elders by prayer and the laying on of hands. (See p. 37.)<br>
Once ordained, elders need not be ordained again if reelected, or upon<br>
election as elders of other churches, provided they have maintained regular<br>
membership status. They are also qualified to serve as deacons.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Relationship to the Pastor</em></strong>—If the conference committee assigns a<br>
pastor or pastors to the congregation, the pastor, or senior pastor if more<br>
                                                      <em>74 CHURCH MANUAL</em><br>
than one, should be considered the ranking officer and the local elders as<br>
assistants. Since their work is closely related, they should work together<br>
harmoniously. The pastor should not assume all lines of responsibility, but<br>
should share these with the elders and other officers. The pastor regularly<br>
serving the church acts as the chairperson of the board. (See pp. 32, 131.)<br>
There may be circumstances, however, when it would be advisable for an<br>
elder to act as chairperson. The pastoral work of the church should be<br>
shared by the pastor and the elders. In counsel with the pastor, the elders<br>
should visit members, minister to the sick, foster prayer ministries, arrange<br>
or lead out in anointing services and child dedications, encourage the<br>
disheartened, and assist in other pastoral responsibilities. As<br>
undershepherds, elders should exercise constant vigilance over the flock.<br>
If the pastor is a licensed minister, the church or churches served<br>
should elect the pastor as an elder. (See p. 33.)<br>
Because the pastor is appointed to the position in the church by the<br>
conference, the pastor serves the church as a conference employee, is<br>
responsible to the conference committee, and maintains a sympathetic and<br>
cooperative relation to and works in harmony with all the plans and policies<br>
of the local church. Elders, who are elected by the church, are responsible to<br>
that body and to its board. (See below.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Work of Elders Is Local</em></strong>—The authority and work of elders are<br>
confined to the church in which their election has been made. It is not<br>
permissible for a conference committee by vote to confer on an elder the<br>
status that is granted to an ordained pastor to serve other churches as elder.<br>
If that need exists, the conference committee may recommend to the church<br>
needing an elder that it invite and elect the elder of a nearby church to serve.<br>
Thus by election one individual may, when necessary, serve more than one<br>
church. Such an arrangement should be made only in counsel with the<br>
conference committee. Authority to elect elders is inherent in the local<br>
church and not in the conference committee. The only way one may be<br>
qualified for serving the Church at large is by ordination to the gospel<br>
ministry. (See pp. 32, 73, 74.)<br>

the pastor, an elder is responsible for the services of the church and must<br>
either conduct them or arrange for someone to do so. Communion services<br>
must always be conducted by an ordained/commissioned pastor or local<br>
elder. The pastor usually chairs the business meeting. In the absence of the<br>
                                                      <em>LOCAL CHURCH OFFICERS AND ORGANIZATIONS 75</em><br>
pastor, and with approval of the pastor or the conference president, an elder<br>
should serve as chairperson.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Baptismal Service</em></strong>—In the absence of an ordained pastor, an elder<br>
shall request the conference president to arrange for the baptism of those<br>
desiring to unite with the church. (See pp. 45-49.) An elder should not<br>
officiate in the service without first obtaining permission from the<br>
conference president.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Marriage Ceremony</em></strong>—In a marriage ceremony the charge, vows, and<br>
declaration of marriage are given only by an ordained pastor except in those<br>
areas where division committees have approved that selected licensed or<br>
commissioned pastors who have been ordained as local elders may perform<br>
the ceremony. (See p. 33.) Local laws may require that persons conducting<br>
marriage ceremonies also hold state licensure/permit to do so. An ordained<br>
pastor, a licensed or commissioned pastor, or an elder may deliver the<br>
sermonette, offer the prayer, and give the blessing. (See Notes, #1, p. 173.)<br>

encourage other members to return a faithful tithe. (See pp. 136, 137, 169.)<br>
Elders can foster tithing by public presentation of the scriptural privilege<br>
and responsibility of stewardship and by personal labor with members in a<br>
tactful and helpful manner.<br>
Elders should regard all financial matters pertaining to members as<br>
confidential and shall not give such information to unauthorized persons.<br>

As spiritual leaders, elders are responsible for encouraging members to<br>
develop a personal relationship with Jesus by strengthening their habits of<br>
personal Bible study and prayer. Elders should model a commitment to<br>
Bible study and prayer. An effective personal prayer life of every member,<br>
supporting all ministries and programs of the local church, will enhance the<br>
church’s mission. Elders may ask the board to appoint a council to assist in<br>
this role of development and encouragement.<br>

pastor, elders are spiritual leaders of the church and are responsible for<br>
fostering all departments and activities of the work. Elders should maintain<br>
a mutually helpful relationship with other officers.<br>
                                                      <strong><em><br>
To Cooperate With the Conference</em></strong>—The pastor, elders, and all<br>
officers should cooperate with conference officers and departmental<br>
directors in carrying out approved plans. They should inform the church of<br>
all regular and special offerings, promote all the programs and activities of<br>
the church, and encourage all officers to support conference plans and<br>
policies.<br>
Elders should work closely with the treasurer and see that all<br>
conference funds are remitted promptly to the conference treasurer at the<br>
time established by the conference. Elders should see that the clerk’s report<br>
is sent promptly to the conference secretary at the close of each quarter.<br>
Elders should regard all correspondence from the conference office as<br>
important. Letters calling for announcements should be presented at the<br>
proper time.<br>
In the absence of the pastor, the first elder (see p. 114) should see that<br>
the church elects delegates to conference sessions and that the clerk sends<br>
the names of delegates to the conference office.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>To Foster Worldwide Work</em></strong>—Elders also should foster world<br>
mission work by carefully studying the worldwide work and encouraging<br>
members to personally support mission work. Their kindly, tactful attitude<br>
will encourage liberality of members both in church services and Sabbath<br>
School.<br>

cooperation with the departments, promotes the training and equipping of<br>
elders. However, the pastor has the primary responsibility for training<br>
elders. (See Notes, #2, p. 173.)<br>

other burdens to perform effectively their many duties. It may be advisable<br>
in some cases to ask elders to lead the outreach (missionary) work of the<br>
church, but even this should be avoided if other talent is available.<br>

more than one elder because the burdens of the office are too great for one<br>
person. If the church elects more than one elder, one should be designated<br>
“first elder.” The work should be divided among the elders in harmony with<br>
their experience and ability.<br>

serve as an elder. Under such circumstances the church should elect a<br>
person to be known as “leader.” In the absence of the pastor or a<br>
conference-assigned pastor, the leader is responsible for the services of the church, including business meetings. The leader must either conduct the church service or arrange for someone else to do so. If the church leader is unable to lead out in the business meeting, the conference should be contacted for assistance.<br>
                                                      <br>
A leader, who is not an ordained elder, may not administer baptism,<br>
conduct the Lord’s Supper, perform the marriage ceremony, or preside at<br>
business meetings when members are disciplined. A request should be made to the conference president for an ordained pastor to preside at such meetings.<br>

                                                      <em>diakonos</em>, from which the English “deacon” is derived. The Greek word is<br>
variously interpreted as “servant, minister, writer, attendant” and in<br>
Christian circles has acquired the specialized meaning now attached to<br>
“deacon.”<br>
                                                      <br>
The men who came to be known as the seven deacons of the apostolic<br>
church were chosen and ordained to attend to the business of the church.<br>
                                                      <br>
(See Acts 6:1-8.) Their qualifications, slightly less exacting than those of<br>
elders, are listed in 1 Timothy 3:8-13.<br>
“The fact that these brethren had been ordained for the special work of<br>
looking after the needs of the poor did not exclude them from teaching the<br>
faith. On the contrary, they were fully qualified to instruct others in the<br>
truth, and they engaged in the work with great earnestness and success.”—<br>
AA 90.<br>
“The appointment of the seven to take the oversight of special lines of<br>
work proved a great blessing to the church. These officers gave careful<br>
consideration to individual needs as well as to the general financial interests<br>
of the church, and by their prudent management and their godly example<br>
they were an important aid to their fellow officers in binding together the<br>
various interests of the church into a united whole.”—AA 89.<br>
Today appointment of deacons through election brings similar<br>
blessings in church administration by relieving pastors, elders, and other<br>
officers of duties that deacons may perform well.<br>
“The time and strength of those who in the providence of God have<br>
been placed in leading positions of responsibility in the church should be<br>
spent in dealing with the weightier matters demanding special wisdom and<br>
largeness of heart. It is not in the order of God that such men should be<br>
appealed to for the adjustment of minor matters that others are well<br>
qualified to handle.”—AA 93.<br>
The Ministerial Association, in connection with the departments,<br>
promotes the training and equipping of deacons. However, the pastor, in<br>
conjunction with the elder(s), has the primary responsibility for training the<br>
deacons. (See Notes, #3, p. 173)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Board of Deacons</em></strong>—Where a church has a number of deacons, it<br>
should organize a board of deacons chaired by the head deacon and with<br>
another deacon serving as secretary. Such a body provides a way to<br>
distribute responsibility and coordinate their contributions to the well-being<br>
of the congregation. It also provides a training ground where new deacons<br>
are instructed in their duties.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Deacons Must Be Ordained</em></strong>—Newly elected deacons cannot fill their<br>
office until they have been ordained by an ordained pastor currently<br>
credentialed by the conference.<br>
The sacred rite of ordination should be characterized by simplicity and<br>
performed in the presence of the church. The pastor may give a brief outline<br>
of the biblical office of deacon, the qualities required for service, and the<br>
principal duties deacons are authorized to perform. After a short exhortation<br>
to faithfulness in service, the pastor, assisted by an elder where appropriate,<br>
ordains the deacons by prayer and the laying on of hands. (See p. 37.)<br>
If they retain church membership, deacons, once ordained, do not have<br>
to be ordained again if they move their memberships to other churches.<br>
When the term for which they were elected expires, they must be reelected<br>
if they are to continue to serve as deacons.<br>
Elders subsequently elected as deacons need not be ordained as<br>
deacons because ordination as elder covers this office.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Deacons Not Authorized to Preside</em></strong>— Deacons are not authorized to<br>
preside at the Lord’s Supper, baptism, or business meetings and are not<br>
permitted to perform the marriage ceremony or officiate at the reception or<br>
transfer of members.<br>
If a church has no one authorized to perform such duties, the church<br>
leader shall contact the conference for assistance.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Duties of Deacons</em></strong>—The work of deacons involves a wide range of<br>
services for the church, including:<br>
1. <em>Assistance at Services and Meetings</em>—Deacons are usually<br>
responsible for welcoming members and visitors as they enter the church<br>
and for assisting them, where necessary, to find seats. They also cooperate<br>
with the pastor and elders for smooth functioning of all meetings.<br>
2. <em>Visitation of Members</em>—In many churches visitation is arranged by<br>
distributing membership by districts and assigning a deacon to each district<br>
with the expectation that he will visit each home at least once a quarter.<br>
3. <em>Preparation for Baptismal Services</em>—Deacons make necessary<br>
preparations for baptismal services. (See p. 48.)<br>
4. <em>Assistance at Communion Service</em>— At the service of<br>
foot-washing, the deacons or deaconesses provide everything needed, such<br>
as towels, basins, water, and buckets. After the service they see that the<br>
utensils and linen are washed and properly stored.<br>
Remaining bread and wine should not be consumed, but disposed of in<br>
a respectful manner by deacons and deaconesses following the Lord’s<br>
Supper.<br>
5. <em>Care of the Sick and Aiding the Poor and Unfortunate</em>—Deacons<br>
and deaconesses are charged with assisting the sick, poor, and unfortunate<br>
and should keep the church informed of their needs and enlist the support of<br>
members. Money should be provided for this work from the fund for the<br>
poor and needy. The treasurer, on recommendation from the board, will<br>
pass over to the deacons or deaconesses whatever may be needed for use in<br>
needy cases.<br>
6. <em>Care and Maintenance of Property</em>—In churches where the<br>
responsibility for the care and maintenance of church property is not<br>
assigned to a building committee, deacons and deaconesses have this<br>
responsibility. (See Notes, #3, p. 173.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Deaconesses</strong><br>
Deaconesses were included in the official staff of the early Christian<br>
churches.<br>
“I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church<br>
[deaconess] in Cenchrea, that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner<br>
worthy of the saints, and assist her in whatever business she has need of<br>
you; for indeed she has been a helper of many and of myself also”<br>
(Rom. 16:1, 2).<br>
Deaconesses should be chosen for their consecration and other<br>
qualifications that fit them for the duties of the office.<br>
The Ministerial Association, in connection with the departments,<br>
promotes the training and equipping of deaconesses. However, the pastor, in<br>
conjunction with the elder(s), has the primary responsibility for training the<br>
deaconesses. (See Notes, #3, p. 173)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Board of Deaconesses</em></strong>—If a church elects several deaconesses, it<br>
should organize a board of deaconesses chaired by the head deaconess and<br>
another deaconess serving as secretary. This board is authorized to assign<br>
duties to individual deaconesses and cooperates closely with the board of<br>
deacons, especially in welcoming members and visitors and in home<br>
visitation. (See p. 78.) It also provides a training ground where new<br>
deaconesses are instructed in their duties.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Ordination Service for Deaconesses</em></strong>—Such a service, like the<br>
ordination of deacons, would be carried out by an ordained pastor currently<br>
credentialed by the conference. The ordination service should be<br>
characterized by simplicity and performed in the presence of the church.<br>
If they retain church membership, deaconesses do not have to be<br>
ordained again if they move their memberships to other churches. When the<br>
term for which they were elected expires, they must be reelected if they are<br>
to continue to serve as deaconesses.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Deaconesses Not Authorized to Preside</em></strong>—Deaconesses are not<br>
authorized to preside at any of the services of the church or business<br>
meetings and cannot perform the marriage ceremony or officiate at the<br>
reception or transfer of members.<br>
If a church has no one authorized to perform such duties, the church<br>
leader shall contact the conference for assistance.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Duties of Deaconesses</em></strong>—Deaconesses serve the church in a wide<br>
variety of activities, including:<br>
1. <em>Greeting and Visiting Guests and Members</em>—In many churches,<br>
deaconesses assist in greeting guests and members at meetings and in<br>
visiting members in their homes when they cannot attend services.<br>
2. <em>Assistance at Baptisms</em>—Deaconesses ensure that female<br>
candidates are cared for both before and after the ceremony. They also give<br>
such counsel and help as may be necessary regarding suitable garments for<br>
baptism. Robes of suitable material should be provided. Where robes are<br>
used, the deaconesses should see that they are laundered and carefully<br>
stored. (See p. 48.)<br>
3. <em>Arrangements for the Communion Service</em>—Deaconesses and<br>
deacons arrange for everything needed for this service and see that<br>
everything used is cared for afterward. (See p. 126.)<br>
Before the communion service begins, deaconesses set the communion<br>
table, including preparing the bread and wine, pouring the wine, placing the<br>
plates of unleavened bread, and covering the table with the linen provided<br>
for that purpose.<br>
Deaconesses assist in the service of foot-washing, giving special aid to<br>
women visitors and new members.<br>
                                                      <br>
4. <em>The Care of the Sick and the Poor</em>—Deaconesses assist deacons in<br>
caring for the sick, needy, and unfortunate. (See p. 79.)<br>
                                                      <br>
5. <em>Care and Maintenance of Property</em>—In churches where the<br>
responsibility for the care and maintenance of church property is not<br>
assigned to a building committee, deacons and deaconesses have this<br>
responsibility. (See Notes, #4, pp. 173-174.)<br>

the clerk. Because of the important and specialized functions of this office, it is wise to choose one who can be reelected to provide continuity in record keeping and reporting. Large churches may elect assistant clerks as needed.<br>
                                                      <br>
When the clerk, as secretary, cannot attend a business meeting, the clerk should arrange for an assistant to be present to take the minutes. (See Notes, #5, p. 174.)<br>
                                                      <br>

authority to add names to or remove names from the membership record<br>
without a vote of the church, which must always vote to add or remove a<br>
name, except in the case of the death of a member, or when a member<br>
requests in writing to be removed from membership. When a member dies,<br>
the clerk will record the date of the death in the membership record. (See<br>
p. 55.)<br>
When a member submits a written request to the church board to be<br>
removed from membership, the clerk will record the action of the board.<br>
(See pp. 66-67.)<br>

members and churches in the transferring of memberships. (See pp. 51-55.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Corresponding With Members</em></strong>—The clerk should try to keep in<br>
touch with absent members. (See Notes, #6, p. 174.)<br>
                                                      <br>

authorization of the board, promptly notifies the conference of delegates<br>
elected to represent the church at a conference session, using blanks or<br>
forms provided by the conference. (See p. 114.)<br>
                                                      <br>

furnish reports requested by the conference. Some are quarterly, others<br>
annual. It is essential that reports be sent to the conference secretary within<br>
the time specified because they are important for the accuracy of reports<br>
prepared by other organizations of the world Church. The clerk collects<br>
information for these reports from the other officers and department leaders.<br>

carefully preserved. All records and account books of all officers are the<br>
property of the church and are to be surrendered to the newly elected clerk at the expiration of the term of office of the previous clerk, or to the church at any time during the term on request of the pastor or elders.<br>

one who can be reelected to provide continuity in record keeping and<br>
reporting. Large churches may elect assistant treasurers as needed.<br>
The treasurer can greatly encourage faithfulness in the returning of tithe<br>
and deepen the spirit of liberality on the part of the members. A word of<br>
counsel given in the spirit of the Master will help members to render<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Treasurer the Custodian of All Funds</em></strong>—The treasurer is the<br>
custodian of all church funds. These include (1) conference funds, (2) local<br>
church funds, and (3) funds belonging to auxiliary organizations of the local<br>
church.<br>
All funds (conference, local church, and local church auxiliary) are<br>
deposited by the treasurer in a bank or financial institution account in the<br>
name of the church, unless the local conference authorizes another system.<br>
Surplus church funds may be deposited in savings accounts upon<br>
authorization of the board. Where large balances are carried for building or<br>
special projects, the board may authorize separate bank accounts. Such<br>
accounts, however, shall be operated by the treasurer and reported to the<br>
church along with all other church funds.<br>
All church bank accounts are exclusively for church funds and are<br>
never to be combined with any personal account or funds.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Conference Funds</em></strong>—Conference funds, which include tithe, all regular<br>
mission funds, and all funds for special conference projects and institutions,<br>
are trust funds. At the close of each month, or more often if requested by the<br>
conference, the treasurer shall send to the conference treasurer the entire<br>
amount of conference funds received during that period of time. The church<br>
may not borrow, use, or withhold such conference funds for any purpose.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Sabbath School Funds</em></strong>—All Sabbath School offerings are to be<br>
passed over weekly to the treasurer by the Sabbath School secretarytreasurer, the treasurer keeping a careful record of all such offerings. These<br>
mission funds are transmitted to the conference office as outlined in the<br>
previous paragraph. Sabbath School expense funds are held in trust, subject<br>
to the orders of the Sabbath School council (see pp. 97, 98), to meet the<br>
routine expenses of the Sabbath School.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Local Church Funds</em></strong>—Local church funds include church expense,<br>
building and repair funds, and the fund for the poor and needy. These funds<br>
belong to the local church and are disbursed by the treasurer only by<br>
authorization of the board or business meeting. However, the treasurer shall<br>
pay from the expense funds all bills for local expense that have been<br>
authorized by the board.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Funds of Auxiliary Organizations</em></strong>—Auxiliary organization funds<br>
include such funds as church outreach programs, family life, Adventist<br>
Youth Ministries, Adventist Community Services or Dorcas Society,<br>
Sabbath School expense, and that portion of the health ministries funds<br>
belonging to the church, and may include church school funds. All money<br>
received by and for these organizations is turned over promptly to the<br>
church treasurer by the secretary of the organization, the deacons, or<br>
whoever has received the funds. These funds belong to the auxiliary<br>
organizations of the church. They may be disbursed only by order of the<br>
auxiliary organization to which they belong.<br>
The treasurer shall give receipts for all funds received. On receiving<br>
money from the treasurer, the secretary of the auxiliary organization shall<br>
give a proper receipt to the treasurer.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Safeguarding the Purpose of Funds</em></strong>—When an offering is taken for<br>
worldwide missions or for any general or local enterprise, all money placed<br>
in the offering plate (unless otherwise indicated by the donor) shall be<br>
counted as part of that particular offering. All offerings and gifts<br>
contributed by individuals for a specific fund or purpose must be used for<br>
that purpose. Neither the treasurer nor the board has the authority to divert<br>
any funds from the objective for which they were given.<br>
The funds of auxiliary organizations, often donations given for specific<br>
purposes, are raised for that special part of the church’s work for which the<br>
auxiliary organization is established. Such funds are held in trust by the<br>
treasurer, and they too may not be borrowed or in any way diverted by the<br>
treasurer or the board from the objective for which they were raised.<br>
When an auxiliary organization is discontinued, the church in regular<br>
business session may take action indicating the disposition of any balance<br>
of funds in the account of the organization.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Money for Personal Literature Orders</em></strong>—Money for personal orders<br>
of literature, books, pamphlets, magazines, and subscriptions for periodicals<br>
is cared for by the treasurer in areas where a local Adventist Book Center<br>
does not exist. (See Notes, #7, p. 174.)<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Proper Method for Payment of Money by Members</em></strong>—The treasurer<br>
should urge that all money paid in by members, other than the regular<br>
church collection, be placed in tithe and offering envelopes, unless an<br>
alternative method has been implemented by the conference. Members<br>
should list the various items and amounts on the envelope as indicated and<br>
to make sure that the money enclosed equals the total shown. They should<br>
also sign their names and give their addresses, and place the envelopes in<br>
the offering plate or hand them to the treasurer, who should preserve the<br>
envelopes to serve as vouchers until all accounts are checked by the<br>
conference auditor.<br>
Members who return their tithes and offerings by check or postal notes<br>
should, where legally possible, make such checks or notes payable to the<br>
church, rather than to any individual.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Receipts to Members</em></strong>—Receipts should be issued promptly for all<br>
money received from members, no matter how small the amount, and a<br>
strict account of all receipts and payments should be kept by the treasurer.<br>
All general offerings not in envelopes should be counted by the treasurer in<br>
the presence of another officer, preferably a deacon or deaconess, and a<br>
receipt given to such officer.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Proper Method of Remitting Funds to the Conference</em></strong>—In sending<br>
remittances to the conference treasurer, all checks, bank drafts, or money<br>
orders should be made payable to the organization wherever legally<br>
possible and not to any individual. A copy of the treasurer’s records for the<br>
period should be enclosed with the remittance. Remittance blanks are<br>
furnished by the conference. (See pp. 136, 137.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Preservation of Financial Documents</em></strong>—Financial documents,<br>
vouchers, or receipted bills should be secured for all funds received and<br>
disbursed in accordance with the system authorized by the local conference.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Books Should Be Audited</em></strong>—The conference treasurer, or other<br>
individual appointed by the conference committee, audits the church<br>
financial records, usually each year.<br>
The treasurer’s books and other financial records relating to the work of<br>
the treasurer, the church school treasurer, and the treasurer of any other<br>
organization may be called for and inspected at any time by the conference<br>
auditor or by the pastor, district leader, head elder, or by any others<br>
authorized by the church board, but should not be made available to<br>
unauthorized persons. (See p. 141.)<br>
Reports of all funds received and disbursed should be presented at the<br>
regular business meetings of the church. A copy of these reports should be<br>
given to the leading officers.<br>
When the number of individuals returning tithe in the church is<br>
reported, the spouse and minor children who are non-wage earners but<br>
members of the church should be counted in this group, in addition to the<br>
wage earner of the family.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Relations With Members Confidential</em></strong>—The treasurer should<br>
always remember that relations with individual members are strictly<br>
confidential. The treasurer should never comment on the tithe returned by any member or on the income or anything concerning it, except to those who share the responsibility of the work. Great harm may be caused by failure to observe this rule.<br>

spiritual growth of members and for the fulfillment of the Church’s mission.<br>
                                                      <br>
It is the skeleton of the ecclesiastical body. And “the whole body, joined<br>
and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective<br>
working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love” (Eph. 4:16).<br>
                                                      <br>
The most important elements of structure and organization are the<br>
officers (see pp. 73-86) and the departments and other organizations. This<br>
section describes their objectives, leadership, and functions.<br>
The work of the departments and auxiliary organizations is closely tied<br>
to the work of the pastor because all are equally engaged in gospel outreach.<br>
The pastor serves as a counselor to these organizations, and they in turn<br>
assist in the overall church outreach programs. In case of emergency, or<br>
where circumstances require, the pastor may call a meeting of any<br>
committee or organization.<br>
Every church should utilize the services of the departments and<br>
organizations to nurture its members and accomplish the mission given by<br>
Christ (see Matt. 28:19; Rev. 10:11; 14:6).<br>

age 14, leading them into union with the Church. It seeks to provide<br>
multiple ministries that will lead children to Jesus and disciple them in their<br>
daily walk with Him. It cooperates with the Sabbath School and other<br>
departments to provide religious education to children and fulfills its<br>
mission by developing a variety of grace-oriented ministries for children<br>
that are inclusive, service-oriented, leadership-building, safe, and<br>
evangelistic.<br>
“Too much importance cannot be placed on the early training of<br>
children. The lessons that the child learns during the first seven years of life<br>
have more to do with forming his character than all that it learns in future<br>
years.”—CG 193.<br>
“It is still true that children are the most susceptible to the teachings of<br>
the gospel; their hearts are open to divine influences, and strong to retain<br>
the lessons received. The little children may be Christians, having an<br>
experience in accordance with their years. They need to be educated in<br>
spiritual things, and parents should give them every advantage, that they<br>
may form characters after the similitude of the character of Christ.”—<br>
DA 515.<br>
“Children of eight, ten, or twelve years are old enough to be addressed<br>
on the subject of personal religion. . . . If properly instructed, very young<br>
children may have correct views of their state as sinners and of the way of<br>
salvation through Christ.”—1T 400.<br>
“When Jesus told the disciples not to forbid the children to come to<br>
Him, He was speaking to His followers in all ages—to officers of the<br>
church, to ministers, helpers, and all Christians. Jesus is drawing the<br>
children, and He bids us, Suffer them to come; as if He would say, They<br>
will come if you do not hinder them.”—DA 517.<br>

elects a children’s ministries coordinator to develop ministries that nurture<br>

the faith of children. The coordinator should have leadership ability as well<br>
as experience and passion for working with children.<br>
The children’s ministries coordinator works with the pastor and board<br>
to establish a children’s ministries committee to provide ministries for<br>
children. The committee should consist of individuals with interest and<br>
experience in working with children. Ordinarily the members include<br>
Sabbath School division leaders, Vacation Bible School leader, Adventist<br>
Junior Youth leaders, and two to three others who have a passion for<br>
ministry to children.<br>
If the church has a children’s ministries department, Vacation Bible<br>
Schools, children’s branch Sabbath Schools, Neighborhood Bible Clubs,<br>
and Story Hours, they will come under the direction of children’s ministries.<br>
(See p. 87.)<br>
Everyone involved in work with children must meet Church and legal<br>
standards and requirements, such as background checks or certification.<br>
Local church leaders should consult with the conference, which will<br>
ascertain and advise as to what background checks and certifications are<br>
available and/or required. (See Notes, #8, pp. 174, 175.)<br>

Church employee, and Church institution. The communication department<br>
promotes the use of a sound program of public relations and all<br>
contemporary communication techniques, sustainable technologies, and<br>
media in the promulgation of the gospel. The church should elect a<br>
communication secretary and, where needed, a communication committee.<br>
“We must take every justifiable means of bringing the light before the<br>
people. Let the press be utilized, and let every advertising agency be<br>
employed that will call attention to the work.”—6T 36.<br>
“Means will be devised to reach hearts. Some of the methods used in<br>
this work will be different from the methods used in the work in the<br>
past.”—Ev 105.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Communication Secretary</em></strong>—The communication secretary should<br>
have the ability to meet people and rightly represent the Church, sound<br>
judgment, good organization, effective writing skills, and a willingness to<br>
carry out assignments.<br>
The secretary gathers and disseminates news to local media, cooperates<br>
with the conference communication director, and presents periodic reports<br>
to the business meeting. The conference communication department<br>
provides appropriate instruction and help to communication secretaries.<br>
The pastor, who is primarily responsible for the communication<br>
program of the church, will work closely in an advisory capacity with the<br>
communication secretary or committee.<br>
Any department or organization may appoint an individual to provide<br>
the communication secretary or committee with information about<br>
newsworthy events.<br>

committee may more adequately handle the many facets of the public<br>
relations and communication program. The church elects the committee,<br>
and the communication secretary serves as chairperson. Members of the<br>
committee may be assigned specific communication responsibilities, such<br>
as working with the press, media producers and online personnel, and<br>
internal church media. If there is a nearby Church institution, a member of<br>
its public relations or communication staff should be invited to sit with the<br>

secretary of each church should be a member and should work in harmony<br>
with any general plan that will better coordinate the handling of news and<br>

promote and generate support for Christian education. The secretary is a<br>
member of the Home and School Association executive committee and<br>
works in cooperation with the association.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Home and School Association</em></strong>—A church with a school shall<br>
establish a Home and School Association, the purpose of which is to<br>
provide parent education and unite the home, the school, and the church in<br>
endeavors to provide Christian education for the children. Parents of<br>
students, school patrons, and church members should be encouraged to be<br>
active members of the association.<br>
Home and School Association officers shall be a leader, assistant<br>
leader, secretary-treasurer, librarian, and the educational secretary. (See<br>
p. 179.) To give continuity, some of the officers should be elected for<br>
second terms. All shall be members of the church.<br>
The leader of the association shall be a member with success in training<br>
children, whose mind is open to new ideas, and who believes in the<br>
importance of Christian education.<br>
The secretary-treasurer keeps the records of the association and reports<br>
to the director of the conference education department at the beginning and<br>
end of each school year. Association funds are channeled through the<br>
church/school treasurer, kept as a separate account, and audited under<br>
denominational policy.<br>
The principal is an ex officio member of the Home and School<br>
Association committee.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Church School Board</em></strong>—The administrative body of every elementary<br>
(primary) school and junior academy (partial high school) operated by one<br>
church shall be a church school board elected by the church or a school<br>
committee appointed by the church board. Thus this body may be a separate<br>
school board, the church board, or a school committee of the church board<br>
appointed for this purpose. Division working policies explain the functions<br>
of school boards.<br>
School board members should be chosen for their consecration, their<br>
belief in and loyalty to the principles of Christian education, their good<br>
judgment and tact, their experience in school matters, and their financial<br>
judgment and ability. They should believe in and be willing to follow<br>
denominational educational policies and recommendations.<br>
If two or more churches jointly operate what is known as a<br>
multiconstituent school, the administrative body shall be drawn from the<br>
constituent churches.<br>
One or more members of the school board should be chosen from<br>
among the members of the church board, so that the school board may be<br>
closely related to the church board.<br>
The pastor should be a member of the school board. If the school is<br>
operated by more than one church, generally the pastors of the participating<br>
churches concerned are members of the board.<br>
In junior academies and elementary schools, the principal or head<br>
teacher should be a member of the board.<br>
Some members of the board may be parents of children attending the<br>
school, so the board may profit from parental viewpoints and counsel<br>
resulting from close observation and experience.<br>
The school board officers shall be a chairperson and a secretary. If the<br>
school is operated by one church, the church elects the chairperson.<br>
In multiconstituent school boards, additional officers shall include a<br>
treasurer, a vice chairperson, and an assistant secretary. At its first meeting<br>
after its election, a union school board elects its own chairperson from<br>
among its members. In the event that agreement between the churches is not<br>
possible, the appointment will be made by the conference board of<br>
education or the conference committee. The principal of the school<br>
generally is appointed secretary of the board.<br>
Any action of a multiconstituent school board that involves the<br>
supporting churches in financial obligations must be submitted to their<br>
respective boards for approval.<br>
Where a separate school board is elected, one of two plans may be<br>
followed to establish time of election and term of office: (1) all the<br>
members may be elected at the close of the calendar or fiscal year and<br>
function for one year; (2) the members of the first board may be chosen for<br>
terms of one, two, and three years, respectively, with replacement members<br>
being chosen each succeeding year for a term of three years. The purpose of<br>
this plan is to have a nucleus of experienced members on the board to<br>
ensure a continuity of policy. When a midterm vacancy is filled, the new<br>
member serves the remainder of the original term.<br>
The school board or school committee should meet at a regular time<br>
and place at least once each month during the school year.<br>
The school board chairperson calls meetings, presides, sees that the<br>
actions of the board are carried out, and countersigns all financial orders<br>
issued by the secretary. The chairperson is a member ex officio of the<br>
elementary school and junior academy inspection committee, which surveys<br>
and evaluates the school and its work.<br>
The secretary keeps a permanent record of meetings, issues orders for<br>
money to pay accounts or obligations, and carries on correspondence for the<br>
board.<br>
Where one church operates a school, the work of the treasurer is<br>
usually carried by the church treasurer or an assistant church treasurer, who<br>
receives tuition and other money, pays out money on the order of the<br>
secretary (countersigned by the chairperson), keeps a careful account of all<br>
transfers, and at each monthly meeting gives a detailed report to the board.<br>
In a multiconstituent board, a treasurer is appointed by the union board.<br>

family. The family was established by divine creation with marriage at its<br>
center.<br>
As the primary setting in which values are learned and the capacity for<br>
close relationships with God and others is developed, its health is vital to<br>
the Church’s disciple-making mission.<br>
Family ministries upholds the biblical teaching related to the family<br>
and lifts up God’s ideals for family living. At the same time, it brings an<br>
understanding of the brokenness experienced by individuals and families in<br>
a fallen world. The department facilitates understanding, unity, and love at<br>
home and in the family of God. It fosters reconciliation between the<br>
generations promised in the Elijah message of Malachi 4:5, 6 and extends<br>
hope and support to those who have been hurt by abuse, family dysfunction,<br>
and broken relationships. Relational growth opportunities are provided<br>
through family life education and enrichment. Individuals, married couples,<br>
and families are helped to avail themselves of professional counseling when<br>
necessary.<br>
Ministry to families in the local church focuses on premarital guidance<br>
for couples, marriage strengthening programs, and the education of parents.<br>
Ministry to families also gives attention to the special needs of single<br>
parents and stepfamilies and provides instruction in family-to-family<br>
evangelism.<br>
“Our work for Christ is to begin with the family, in the home. . . . There<br>
is no missionary field more important than this. . . . By many this home<br>
field has been shamefully neglected, and it is time that divine resources and<br>
remedies were presented, that this state of evil may be corrected.”— AH 35.<br>
“God designs that the families of earth shall be a symbol of the family<br>
in heaven. Christian homes, established and conducted in accordance with<br>
God’s plan, are among His most effective agencies for the formation of<br>
Christian character and for the advancement of His work.”—6T 430.<br>
“The mission of the home extends beyond its own members. . . . Far<br>
more powerful than any sermon that can be preached is the influence of a<br>
true home upon human hearts and lives.”—MH 352.<br>

pp. 154-156 for the Church’s definition of marriage) may be elected to<br>
serve as family ministries leader(s). They should model strong and growing<br>
family relationships and exhibit a sincere interest in fostering the well-being<br>
of all families. In order to be effective, the family ministries leader(s) must<br>
have an understanding of God’s redemptive plan for dealing with the<br>
brokenness in relationships that sin has brought. The leader(s) also must<br>
maintain appropriate confidentiality and know when and how to encourage<br>
individuals in critical situations to seek professional counseling.<br>

an associate leader. The leader should be health-oriented and interested in<br>
promoting the Church’s standards in healthful living among members and<br>
in the community through church-operated health ministries programs. The<br>
leader should be able to screen programs and information that are<br>
representative of the ideals and philosophy of the Church and to integrate<br>
them into an effective spiritual and physical witness.<br>

cooking schools, health classes, stress-control programs, and related<br>

be introduced into our services.<br>
Music leaders should work closely with the pastor or elders in order<br>
that musical selections harmonize with the sermon theme. The music leader<br>
is under the direction of the pastor or elders and does not work<br>
independently. The music leader should counsel with them about the music<br>
to be rendered and the selection of singers and musicians.<br>

worship. The church must exercise care in selecting choir members and<br>
other musicians who will rightly represent Church principles. They should<br>
be members of the church, the Sabbath School, or the Adventist Youth<br>
Ministries. Because they occupy a conspicuous place in church services,<br>
they should be examples of modesty and decorum in their appearance and<br>
dress. Choir robes are optional.<br>
Churches may have multiple choirs. A children’s choir is a means of<br>
spiritual nurture, bonding to the church family, and outreach.<br>

because it awakens in them a love for its sacred truths, and a desire to study<br>
them for themselves; above all, it teaches them to regulate their lives by its<br>

as carrying on Sabbath School evangelism by means of regular Sabbath<br>
School classes and such activities as Decision Days, pastors’ Bible classes,<br>

may include assistant division leaders, division secretaries, music directors,<br>
pianists and/or organists, and greeters.<br>
In addition to the appointed officers listed above, the council studies<br>
the need of all divisions and groups and appoints teachers whose names are<br>
submitted to the board for approval. To maintain both the integrity of the<br>
Sabbath School lesson curriculum and the quality of teaching, the council<br>
should exercise great care in choosing teachers. Particularly when selecting<br>
teachers for the children’s divisions, the council should consult with<br>
division leaders. All teachers shall be members of the church in regular<br>
standing.<br>
The council is responsible for the successful operation of the entire<br>
Sabbath School through the superintendent. The council should meet<br>
regularly as needed. The council should ensure that program helps and<br>
materials, including the Sabbath School Bible study guide prepared by the<br>
General Conference, are supplied in sufficient quantities.<br>
                                                      <strong><em>Sabbath School Superintendent and Other Sabbath School<br>
Officers</em></strong>—The superintendent is the leading officer of the Sabbath School<br>
and should begin planning for its smooth and effective operation as soon as<br>
elected. The superintendent should support the plans and emphases of the<br>
conference Sabbath School department and should implement decisions of<br>
the Sabbath School council concerning the operation of the Sabbath School.<br>
The church may elect one or more assistant superintendents.<br>
The secretary should complete the quarterly report on the appropriate<br>
form immediately after the last Sabbath of the quarter and mail it before the<br>
deadline to the conference Sabbath School and personal ministries directors.<br>
The secretary also should place a copy in the secretary’s permanent file,<br>
give copies to the superintendent and the pastor, and present it at the<br>
business meeting.<br>
The Investment secretary promotes the Investment plan for mission<br>
support in all Sabbath School divisions and keeps all members informed as<br>
the program progresses.<br>
The Vacation Bible School (VBS) director leads in organizing,<br>
promoting, and launching community evangelism through the annual VBS.<br>
The church may assign this responsibility to the children’s ministries<br>
coordinator.<br>
The council may appoint a music director for the Sabbath School in<br>
consultation with division leaders. As an expression of worship, music<br>
should glorify God. Singers and other musicians should be as carefully<br>
selected as are the leaders for other parts of the Sabbath School service and<br>
should be measured by the same standards. (See pp. 95, 150.) The council<br>
also may appoint pianists and organists for the divisions.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Sabbath School Division Leaders</em></strong>—The church board elects a leader<br>
for each division. The Sabbath School council may appoint assistant<br>
division leaders as needed. The Sabbath School Handbook, available from<br>
the Adventist Book Center or the conference Sabbath School department,<br>
contains information about all divisions, from beginners through adult and<br>
the extension division, which cares for those unable to attend Sabbath<br>
School.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Sabbath School Teachers</em></strong>—The Sabbath School council chooses and<br>
the church board approves Sabbath School teachers. They should have an<br>
aptitude for teaching and be willing to study ways to improve their teaching<br>
abilities. They should be diligent in preparation, regular and punctual in<br>
attendance, and examples in the daily study of the Sabbath School Bible<br>
study guide.<br>
The council should make special effort to select teachers for children<br>
and youth who have an interest in those age levels and ability to meet their<br>
needs. Everyone involved in work with the children’s divisions must meet<br>
Church and legal standards and requirements, such as background checks or<br>
certification. Local church leaders should consult with the conference,<br>
which will ascertain and advise as to what background checks and<br>
certifications are available and/or required. (See Notes, #8, pp. 174, 175.)<br>
All teachers should be encouraged to participate in the teacher training<br>
courses available through the conference Sabbath School department.<br>
Every Sabbath School should have a weekly teachers’ meeting.<br>
Realizing that “none but those who have fortified the mind with the<br>
truths of the Bible will stand through the last great conflict” (GC 593, 594),<br>
Sabbath School leaders should strongly encourage regular systematic study<br>
of the Word. The Sabbath School Bible study guide is designed to<br>
encourage daily feasting on the Word, a practice that has done much to<br>
maintain unity throughout the Church. Every member should have access to<br>
the appropriate age-level Sabbath School Bible study guide published by<br>
the General Conference and/or division. Similarly, every leader and teacher<br>
should have access to the helps produced for the various Sabbath School<br>
divisions by the General Conference and/or division.<br>
Teachers should have at least 30 minutes during which to teach their<br>
classes.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Sabbath School Offerings</em></strong>—The Sabbath School secretary should<br>
accurately record Sabbath School offerings and pass them on to the<br>
treasurer as soon as possible. Extension division offerings should be added<br>
to the regular Sabbath School offerings. Many Sabbath Schools take<br>
offerings for Sabbath School expense. With the exception of that expense<br>
fund, all Sabbath School offerings are for the support of the mission fields<br>
and are to be passed on in their entirety by the treasurer to the conference.<br>
These funds include the regular weekly Sabbath School offering, the<br>
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, Sabbath School Investment, and<br>
Birthday-Thank Offering. Each is to be identified as a separate fund in the<br>
financial system of the church. Mission funds are distributed according to<br>
policy. No mission funds may be retained by the church or conference.<br>
The Sabbath School expense offering and the mission offering, where<br>
the calendar of offerings is being used, shall not be taken as one offering<br>
and divided according to an agreed-upon formula or percentage. The<br>
offerings may be taken as combined offering where the church is operating<br>
under a division-approved combined offering plan.<br>

the outreach (missionary) efforts of the church and works under the<br>
direction of the board. The council should meet at least once each month<br>
and should consist of the pastor, an elder, the treasurer, and leaders of the<br>
other departments and auxiliary services functioning in that congregation.<br>
The personal ministries council may assign subcommittees for specialized<br>
tasks. All subcommittees report to the personal ministries council. The<br>
personal ministries council and leader are responsible for organizing small<br>
group ministries.<br>

the contribution of women’s ministries to church life. The leader’s liaison<br>
for training and resource material is the conference women’s ministries<br>

The women’s ministries leader should be a sensitive, caring woman<br>
with a burden for women’s ministry and concerns, a balance in her<br>
perspectives, an ability to encourage other women to cultivate their spiritual<br>
gifts, and an ability to work well with women in the church, the pastor, and<br>
the board.<br>
The women’s ministries committee fosters ministry to women in the<br>
church. This committee should be composed of those interested in the broad spectrum of women’s needs and services and those with varied talents and experience.<br>

The youth ministries program of the church comprises three broad<br>
categories, namely: Junior Youth (Adventurers: ages 6-9 and Pathfinders:<br>
ages 10-15), Senior Youth (Ambassadors: ages 16-21 and Young Adults:<br>
ages 22-30+), and Public Campus Students: ages 16-30+.<br>
God said to Moses, “And these words which I command you today<br>
shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and<br>
shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way,<br>
when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on<br>
your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write<br>
them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates” (Deut. 6:6-9).<br>
The apostle Paul added, “Let no one despise your youth, but be an<br>
example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in<br>
purity” (1 Tim. 4:12).<br>
“We have an army of youth today who can do much if they are<br>
properly directed and encouraged. . . . We want them to be blessed of God.<br>
We want them to act a part in well-organized plans for helping other<br>
youth.”— GCB, Jan. 29, 30, 1893, p. 24.<br>
“When the youth give their hearts to God, our responsibility for them<br>
does not cease. They must be interested in the Lord’s work, and led to see<br>
that He expects them to do something to advance His cause. It is not enough<br>
to show how much needs to be done, and to urge the youth to act a part.<br>
They must be taught how to labor for the Master. They must be trained,<br>
disciplined, drilled, in the best methods of winning souls to Christ. Teach<br>
them to try in a quiet, unpretending way to help their young companions.<br>
Let different branches of missionary effort be systematically laid out, in<br>
which they may take part, and let them be given instruction and help. Thus<br>
they will learn to work for God.”—GW 210.<br>
“With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might<br>
furnish, how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and soon-coming<br>
Savior might be carried to the whole world!”—MYP 196.<br>
While there is to be an active Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM) in<br>
every church, it is important that the youth program not be isolated from the<br>
rest of the church. In addition to their AYM participation, youth should be<br>
integrated into responsible leadership and in all lines of church work. As<br>
young elders, deacons, and deaconesses, for example, they can work with<br>
and learn from experienced officers.<br>
“In order that the work may go forward in all its branches, God calls for<br>
youthful vigor, zeal, and courage. He has chosen the youth to aid in the<br>
advancement of His cause. To plan with clear mind and execute with<br>
courageous hand demands fresh, uncrippled energies. Young men and<br>
women are invited to give God the strength of their youth, that through the<br>
exercise of their powers, through keen thought and vigorous action, they<br>
may bring glory to Him and salvation to their fellow men.”—GW 67.<br>

outlet for the spirit of adventure and exploration, in the context of spiritual<br>
development and soul-winning, for ages 10 to 15. Activities are carefully<br>
tailored to include outdoor living, nature exploration, crafts, hobbies, or<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Pathfinder Committee</em></strong>—The Pathfinder Club director and deputy<br>
directors are elected by the church. (See pp. 105, 179.) If two deputy<br>
directors are elected, there should be one male and one female. One of the<br>
deputy directors may also serve as club secretary and treasurer. The director<br>
is a member of the board and the Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM)<br>
Committee.<br>
Additional Pathfinder staff may include instructors of craft and nature<br>
classes and counselors who are each responsible for a unit of six to eight<br>
Pathfinders.<br>
Resource materials are available from the conference youth ministries<br>
director.<br>
Everyone involved in work with minor children must meet Church and<br>
legal standards and requirements, such as background checks or<br>
certification. Local church leaders should consult with the conference,<br>
which will ascertain and advise as to what background checks and<br>
certifications are available and/or required. (See Notes, #7, pp. 168, 169.)<br>

programs for parents with 6-to-9-year-old children. It is designed to<br>
stimulate the children’s curiosity and includes age-specific activities that<br>
involve both parents and child in recreational activities, simple crafts,<br>
appreciation of God’s creation, and other activities that are of interest to that<br>
age. All is carried out with a spiritual focus, setting the stage for<br>
participation in the church as a Pathfinder.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>AYM Officers</em></strong>—The leaders/directors of the four youth ministry<br>
entities must exemplify Christlike graces and have a burden for soul<br>
winning and contagious enthusiasm. In helping motivate youth to work<br>
together and take responsibilities, the leaders/directors will be in the<br>
background— guiding, counseling, and encouraging youth, helping them<br>
gain experience and the joys of achievement. The leaders/directors should<br>
study the youth profile of the church and seek to involve every eligible<br>
youth in the Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM).<br>
The leaders/directors will keep in touch with the pastor, their respective<br>
sponsors, and the conference youth ministries director, taking advantage of<br>
opportunities for in-service training and leading their respective ministry<br>
into a cooperative relationship with the church and the conference.<br>
The associate leaders/deputy directors (if needed) will assist the<br>
leaders/directors and perform leadership duties when the leaders/directors<br>
are absent. The respective committees may assign additional responsibilities<br>
to the associate leaders/directors.<br>
The secretary-treasurers will keep a record of the activities of their<br>
respective ministries, submit monthly reports on forms provided to the<br>
conference youth ministries director, and encourage youth to report their<br>
witnessing activities during the ten-minute personal ministries period.<br>
The respective assistant secretary-treasurers (if needed) assist with the<br>
secretary- treasurers’ work as assigned.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>AYM Sponsor</em></strong>—The Adventist Youth Ministries (AYM) sponsor may<br>
be an elder or other person on the board who understands the objectives of<br>
the AYM, is sympathetic with youth and their involvement in the church’s<br>
ministries, and will serve as a valued counselor to the youth. The sponsor<br>
serves as a guide or counselor to AYM officers and joins them regularly in<br>
AYM Committee meetings. The sponsor will work with the AYM leader to<br>
present the ministry’s needs to the board.<br>
The sponsor should become acquainted with the conference youth<br>
ministries director and keep the director informed of changes in officer<br>
personnel and other AYM matters. Along with AYM leaders, the sponsor<br>
should attend conference youth training institutes to keep informed about<br>
developments in youth ministry.<br>
For the sake of continuity, the sponsor, if possible, should serve<br>
multiple terms.<br>
Everyone involved in work with minor children must meet Church and<br>
legal standards and requirements, such as background checks or<br>

appointed nominating committee. This committee brings its report to the<br>
church, which then votes on the names presented. This procedure enables the church to give careful study to each name prior to election and avoids the competitive element that may arise when nominations are made from the floor.<br>
                                                      <br>
The nominating committee shall study the needs of the church and inquire into the fitness of members to serve in the different offices. This is<br>
another reason officers shall not be nominated from the floor or by general ballot.<br>
                                                      <br>
The size of the nominating committee will range from five members in<br>
a small church to a larger number in a large church. The number to be<br>
chosen is left to the discretion of each church and should be studied by the<br>
board. A suitable recommendation then will be brought to the church, using<br>
a minimum of time in the Sabbath worship hour.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>When and How the Nominating Committee Is Appointed</em></strong>—The<br>
nominating committee should be appointed early in the closing quarter of<br>
the church year and should report at least three weeks before the final<br>
Sabbath of the church year.<br>
The pastor or district leader or, in the absence of the pastor or district<br>
leader, the elder should bring the matter to the attention of the church. The<br>
church shall then appoint an organizing committee responsible to nominate<br>
the nominating committee. This organizing committee may be chosen in<br>
one of two ways:<br>
1. By nominations, verbal or written, from the floor. If verbal<br>
nominations are made, no member may nominate more than one person.<br>
The effort of one individual or a small group to dictate to the entire<br>
membership is disapproved. Every effort should be made to ensure fair<br>
representation in the composition of the organizing committee. Everything<br>
of a political nature should be avoided. The pastor or district leader shall<br>
serve as chairperson of this organizing committee. If a pastor or district<br>
leader has not yet been appointed to serve as church leader, the chairperson<br>
of this organizing committee shall be appointed by the board from among<br>
the members of the organizing committee. The size of the organizing<br>
committee should be five to seven more than the number of board members.<br>
2. By the church authorizing the board, together with five to seven<br>
additional persons chosen by the church (see preceding paragraph), to<br>
function as the organizing committee. If this method is adopted, the<br>
chairperson of the board normally serves as chairperson of the organizing<br>
committee (see p. 32).<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>How the Process Works</em></strong>—The steps of the nominating process are:<br>
1. The church appoints by vote an organizing committee by one of<br>
the two methods listed above.<br>
2. The organizing committee recommends names to the church for<br>
the nominating committee, with a recommendation for secretary. Every<br>
effort should be made to ensure fair representation in the composition of the<br>
nominating committee.<br>
3. By vote, the church appoints the nominating committee and the<br>
secretary.<br>
4. The pastor or district leader is an ex officio member and serves as<br>
chairperson of the nominating committee. Should the pastor or district<br>
leader choose not to serve as chairperson, or if a pastor or district leader has<br>
not been appointed to the church, the organizing committee shall<br>
recommend the name from the proposed nominating committee to serve as<br>
chairperson.<br>
5. The nominating committee meets to prepare the list of officers that<br>
it will present to the church for approval.<br>
6. By vote, the church appoints its officers for the ensuing year.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Who Should Be Members of the Nominating Committee</em></strong>—Only<br>
members in regular standing should be chosen to serve on the nominating<br>
committee. They should be persons of good judgment who have the welfare<br>
and prosperity of the church at heart.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Work of the Nominating Committee</em></strong>—The chairperson should call a<br>
meeting of the committee as soon as possible after its election. With earnest<br>
prayer the committee should begin preparing a list of nominees for all<br>
offices. Nominees must be members in regular standing of the church<br>
making the appointments. The list of nominees will be presented to the<br>
church at a Sabbath service or at a specially called business meeting. In<br>
making their selections, the committee may counsel with others who are<br>
well informed. This committee does not nominate either the pastor or the<br>
assistant pastor(s), who are appointed by the conference.<br>
The list of officers to be considered by the nominating committee may<br>
vary with size of membership. A larger church may determine it needs more<br>
officers. A smaller church may have fewer. The committee deals with all<br>
leadership positions except Sabbath School teachers, who are recommended<br>
by the Sabbath School council and approved by the board. See Notes, #1,<br>
pp. 178, 179, for a list of possible officers.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Nominating Committee to Get Consent of Prospective Officers</em></strong>—<br>
Having nominated persons who are faithful, loyal members of the local<br>
church, except when the conference has approved an exception (see p. 74,<br>
“Work of Elders Is Local”), the appropriate members of the committee<br>
should inform them of their nominations and secure their consent to serve.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Members May Appear Before the Nominating Committee</em></strong>—<br>
Members desiring to appear before the committee to make suggestions or<br>
objections should be given opportunity to do so. After they have addressed<br>
the committee and retired from the room, the committee should consider<br>
their comments and then make its report to the church.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Nominating Committee Discussions Are Confidential</em></strong>—All<br>
inquiries and discussions of the committee are confidential. It is a violation<br>
of Christian ethics and the spirit of the golden rule for a member of the<br>
committee to repeat outside of the committee any personal or sensitive<br>
information discussed. To offend in this regard is reason for excluding the<br>
committee member from future participation in the work of a nominating<br>
committee. Should the necessity arise for inquiries to be made outside the<br>
committee, the chairperson should make them.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Reporting to the Church</em></strong>—The nominating committee’s report is<br>
presented to the church as a whole and not to the church board, which has<br>
no jurisdiction in the process. The report may be presented at a Sabbath<br>
service or at a specially called business meeting.<br>
When the nominating committee is ready to report, the chairperson<br>
should make appropriate remarks to the church. A copy of the report should<br>
be placed in the hands of members or read aloud by the secretary of the<br>
committee. The chairperson should announce that the church will vote on<br>
the report one or two weeks later.<br>
Every member should vote in the election of officers. Election is by<br>
majority vote of those present and voting.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Objections to the Report of the Nominating Committee</em></strong>—<br>
Members may object to the nominating committee’s report and should<br>
present their objections in person to the committee before the second<br>
reading of the report by making an appointment through the chairperson or<br>
pastor. Or, at the time of the second reading of the report, a member may<br>
request that the whole report be referred without discussion to the<br>
committee for further consideration. It is the usual procedure for the<br>
chairperson to accept the referral. However, if the request becomes a<br>
motion, it is nondebatable and is decided by majority vote.<br>
The chairperson should announce when and where the committee will<br>
meet to hear objections. At that time members making objections, or any<br>
other member who desires to do so, should appear before the committee. If<br>
the election is deferred because of objections, it would be a serious matter<br>
for those raising objections to fail to appear before the committee.<br>
After giving due consideration to the objections presented, the<br>
committee will exercise its judgment as to whether or not any change is<br>
warranted in the committee’s recommendation to the church business<br>
meeting. When the report is again presented, the church proceeds to vote on<br>

Trivial or groundless objections to any name should never be made, but<br>
if there are serious reasons that any nomination should be changed, these<br>
reasons should be stated to the nominating committee.<br>

becomes vacant during the term of office because of death, removal,<br>
resignation, or any other reason, the board nominates a successor to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the term of office and submits the nomination to the church for election.<br>

constituency. The churches of a conference elect delegates to the conference session to represent them in the councils of the conference. The conference session elects conference personnel, grants credentials and licenses (unless the conference constitution gives its executive committee this responsibility), amends its constitution and bylaws if necessary, and transacts other business. One of its most important acts is the election of the executive committee, which functions for the constituency between sessions. In this committee is vested the delegated power and authority of all the churches of the conference.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Choosing Delegates</em></strong>—It is God’s plan that members chosen to be<br>
delegates be trustworthy, tried, and proved, “able to reason from cause to<br>
effect,” because they are to “lay the plans that shall be followed in the<br>
advancement of the work.”—9T 262.<br>
The number of delegates from each church to a conference session is<br>
determined by the conference constitution. When the time comes to select<br>
delegates, the pastor, or the head elder in cooperation with the pastor, brings<br>
the matter before the church. A committee may be appointed to nominate<br>
delegates, or the board may be asked to nominate them. Nothing of a<br>
political nature should be allowed to come into this work. Men and women<br>
of known piety and loyalty and who are able to attend the session should be<br>
nominated as delegates. (See p. 82.)<br>
When the committee or board has completed its work, it reports its<br>
nominees to the church. The church then votes on the nominations. No<br>
church officer is a delegate ex officio. After the election, the clerk fills out<br>
the delegates’ credential blanks and returns them to the secretary of the<br>
conference. The delegates become the representatives of the church, to unite<br>
with the delegates of other churches to transact all business coming before<br>
the conference session.<br>
Delegates to a union conference/mission session are chosen by the<br>
conference, not by the churches. The delegates to a General Conference<br>
Session are chosen by the divisions and the union conferences/missions.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Duty of Delegates</em></strong>—Delegates to a conference session are not chosen<br>
to represent merely the church or conference. They should view the work as<br>
a whole, remembering their responsibility for the welfare of the worldwide<br>
work of the Church. It is not permissible for church or conference<br>
delegations to organize or attempt to direct their votes as a unit. Nor is it<br>
permissible for the delegates from a large church or the conference to claim<br>
preeminence in directing affairs in a conference session. Each delegate<br>
should be susceptible to the direction of the Holy Spirit and vote according<br>
to personal convictions. Any church or conference officer or leader<br>
attempting to control the votes of a group of delegates would be considered<br>
disqualified for holding office.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Responsibility of Conference Officers</em></strong>—The local church has no<br>
authority outside its own body. It unites with other churches in the<br>
conference in delegating authority and responsibility to the conference<br>
officers and executive committee to carry on the work of the conference<br>
between sessions. Conference officers are answerable to the conference as a<br>
whole and not to any one church.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Conference Executive Committee</em></strong>—Conference executive committee<br>
members are elected to represent the work in the entire conference, not that of one church, district, or institution. Each member should foster all<br>
interests of the work in all parts of the field and make decisions only after prayerful and careful study. Decisions of the committee are not to be controlled or influenced by any church, group, or individual.<br>

                                                      <br>
“Although God dwells not in temples made with hands, yet He honors<br>
with His presence the assemblies of His people. He has promised that when they come together to seek Him, to acknowledge their sins, and to pray for one another, He will meet with them by His Spirit. But those who assemble to worship Him should put away every evil thing. Unless they worship Him in spirit and truth and in the beauty of holiness, their coming together will be of no avail.”—PK 50.<br>

meetings is to worship God for His creative work and for the benefits of His<br>
salvation; to understand His Word, His teachings, and His purposes; to<br>
fellowship in faith and love; to witness about our personal faith in Christ’s<br>
atoning sacrifice at the cross; and to learn how to fulfill the gospel<br>
commission of making disciples in all the world (Matt. 28:19, 20).<br>

soul, the house of God on earth is the gate of heaven. The song of praise,<br>
the prayer, the words spoken by Christ’s representatives, are God’s<br>
appointed agencies to prepare a people for the church above, for that loftier<br>
worship into which there can enter nothing that defileth.<br>
“From the sacredness which was attached to the earthly sanctuary,<br>
Christians may learn how they should regard the place where the Lord<br>
meets with His people. . . . God Himself gave the order of His service,<br>
exalting it high above everything of a temporal nature.<br>
“The house is the sanctuary for the family, and the closet or the grove<br>
the most retired place for individual worship; but the church is the sanctuary<br>
for the congregation. There should be rules in regard to the time, the place,<br>
and the manner of worshiping. Nothing that is sacred, nothing that pertains<br>
to the worship of God, should be treated with carelessness or<br>
indifference.”—5T 491.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Teach Children Reverence</em></strong>—“Parents, elevate the standard of<br>
Christianity in the minds of your children; help them to weave Jesus into<br>
their experience; teach them to have the highest reverence for the house of<br>
God and to understand that when they enter the Lord’s house it should be<br>
with hearts that are softened and subdued by such thoughts as these: ‘God is<br>
here; this is His house. I must have pure thoughts and the holiest motives. I<br>
must have no pride, envy, jealousy, evil surmising, hatred, or deception in<br>
my heart, for I am coming into the presence of the holy God. This is the<br>
place where God meets with and blesses His people. The high and holy One<br>
who inhabiteth eternity looks upon me, searches my heart, and reads the<br>
most secret thoughts and acts of my life.’ ”—5T 494.<br>

worshipers enter the place of meeting, they should do so with decorum,<br>
passing quietly to their seats. . . . Common talking, whispering, and<br>
laughing should not be permitted in the house of worship, either before or<br>
after the service. Ardent, active piety should characterize the worshipers.<br>
“If some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting begins, let<br>
them maintain a true spirit of devotion by silent meditation, keeping the<br>
heart uplifted to God in prayer that the service may be of special benefit to<br>
their own hearts and lead to the conviction and conversion of other souls.<br>
They should remember that heavenly messengers are in the house. . . . If<br>
when the people come into the house of worship, they have genuine<br>
reverence for the Lord and bear in mind that they are in His presence, there<br>
will be a sweet eloquence in silence. The whispering and laughing and<br>
talking which might be without sin in a common business place should find<br>
no sanction in the house where God is worshiped. The mind should be<br>
prepared to hear the Word of God, that it may have due weight and suitably<br>
impress the heart.”—5T 492.<br>

some have unwittingly entertained angels” (Heb. 13:2). Every church<br>
should cultivate a spirit of hospitality, an essential element of Christian life<br>
and experience. Nothing is so deadening to the spiritual life of a church as a<br>
cold, formal atmosphere that drives out hospitality and Christian fellowship.<br>
Especially selected greeters should cordially welcome visitors, who also<br>
may be welcomed at the time of the worship service.<br>

not make the most of this branch of worship. The singing is generally done<br>
from impulse or to meet special cases, and at other times those who sing are<br>
left to blunder along, and the music loses its proper effect upon the minds of<br>
those present. Music should have beauty, pathos, and power. Let the voices<br>
be lifted in songs of praise and devotion. Call to your aid, if practicable,<br>
instrumental music, and let the glorious harmony ascend to God, an<br>
acceptable offering.”—4T 71.<br>

people, the Lord’s messengers are not to follow the ways of the world. In<br>
the meetings that are held, they are not to depend on worldly singers and<br>
theatrical display to awaken an interest. How can those who have no interest in the Word of God, who have never read His Word with a sincere desire to understand its truths, be expected to sing with the spirit and the understanding? . . . How can the heavenly choir join in music that is only a form? . . . “The singing is not always to be done by a few. As often as possible, let the entire congregation join.”—9T 143, 144.<br>

make the pulpit a forum for advocating disputed points of doctrine or<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Testing New Light</em></strong>—Members who think they have new light<br>
contrary to the established views of the Church should seek counsel from responsible leaders.<br>
                                                      <br>
“There are a thousand temptations in disguise prepared for those who<br>
have the light of truth; and the only safety for any of us is in receiving no<br>
new doctrine, no new interpretation of the Scriptures, without first<br>
submitting it to brethren of experience. Lay it before them in a humble,<br>
teachable spirit, with earnest prayer; and if they see no light in it, yield to<br>
their judgment; for ‘in the multitude of counselors there is safety.’ ”—<br>
5T 293. (See also Acts 15:1-32.)<br>
This plan was followed in the early church. When a difference of<br>
opinion arose at Antioch over an important question, the believers sent<br>
representatives to Jerusalem to submit the question to the apostles and<br>
                                                      <em>SERVICES AND OTHER MEETINGS 119</em><br>
elders. The believers in Antioch joyfully accepted the decision of the<br>
Jerusalem Council, thus preserving unity and brotherly love.<br>
The counsel to test new light must not be regarded as deterring anyone<br>
from diligently studying the Scriptures, but rather as a protection against the<br>
infiltration of false theories and erroneous doctrines into the Church. God<br>
wants His children faithfully to search His Word for light and truth, but He<br>
does not want them to be led astray by false teachings.<br>
“We have seen only the glimmering of divine glory and of the<br>
infinitude of knowledge and wisdom; we have, as it were, been working on<br>
the surface of the mine, when rich golden ore is beneath the surface, to<br>
reward the one who will dig for it. The shaft must be sunk deeper and yet<br>
deeper in the mine, and the result will be glorious treasure. Through a<br>
correct faith, divine knowledge will become human knowledge.”—<br>
COL 113.<br>
“New light will ever be revealed on the Word of God to him who is in<br>
living connection with the Sun of Righteousness. Let no one come to the<br>
conclusion that there is no more truth to be revealed. The diligent, prayerful<br>
seeker for truth will find precious rays of light yet to shine forth from the<br>
Word of God. Many gems are yet scattered that are to be gathered together<br>
to become the property of the remnant people of God.”—CSW 34.<br>
When new light shines forth from the sacred page to reward the earnest<br>
seeker after truth, it does not make void the old. Instead it merges with the<br>
old, causing it to grow brighter with added luster. Therefore, “the path of<br>
the just is like the shining sun, that shines ever brighter unto the perfect<br>
day” (Prov. 4:18).<br>
Although the child of God must stand ready to accept advancing light,<br>
one must never give heed to any voice, however pious and plausible, that<br>
would lead away from the fundamental doctrines of the Bible.<br>
“We are not to receive the words of those who come with a message<br>
that contradicts the special points of our faith. They gather together a mass<br>
of Scripture, and pile it as proof around their asserted theories. This has<br>
been done over and over again during the past fifty years. And while the<br>
Scriptures are God’s Word, and are to be respected, the application of them, if such application moves one pillar from the foundation that God has sustained these fifty years, is a great mistake. He who makes such an application knows not the wonderful demonstration of the Holy Spirit that gave power and force to the past messages that have come to the people of God.”—CW 32.<br>

just as important that we seek to “keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (verse 3). Such unity requires caution and counsel with church<br>
leadership.<br>
                                                      <br>
“God is leading a people out from the world upon the exalted platform<br>
of eternal truth, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. He will discipline and fit up His people. They will not be at variance, one believing one thing and another having faith and views entirely opposite, each moving independently of the body. Through the diversity of the gifts and governments that He has placed in the church, they will all come to the<br>
unity of the faith. If one man takes his views of Bible truth without regard<br>
to the opinion of his brethren, and justifies his course, alleging that he has a<br>
right to his own peculiar views, and then presses them upon others, how can<br>
he be fulfilling the prayer of Christ? . . .<br>
“Though we have an individual work and an individual responsibility<br>
before God, we are not to follow our own independent judgment, regardless<br>
of the opinions and feelings of our brethren; for this course would lead to<br>
disorder in the church. It is the duty of ministers to respect the judgment of<br>
their brethren; but their relations to one another, as well as the doctrines<br>
they teach, should be brought to the test of the law and the testimony; then,<br>
if hearts are teachable, there will be no divisions among us. Some are<br>
inclined to be disorderly, and are drifting away from the great landmarks of<br>
the faith; but God is moving upon His ministers to be one in doctrine and in<br>
spirit.”—TM 29, 30.<br>
In view of these considerations, it is evident that the pulpit must be<br>
reserved for the preaching of the truths of the Divine Word and the<br>
presentation of denominational plans and policies for the advancement of<br>
the work of God, not personal views and opinions. (See pp. 34, 118, 119.)<br>

elder, or other officer invite strangers or any unauthorized persons to<br>
conduct services. Individuals who have been removed from the ministry or<br>
who have been removed from membership in other places, or designing<br>
persons who have no authority from the church, should not be given access<br>
to the pulpit. Those worthy of confidence will be able to identify themselves<br>
by producing proper credentials.<br>
At times it is acceptable for government officials or civic leaders to<br>
address a congregation, but all others should be excluded from the pulpit<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Sabbath School</em></strong>—The Sabbath School, one of our most important<br>
services, is the church at study. Every Sabbath our members and thousands<br>
of interested friends meet in Sabbath School to study God’s Word<br>
systematically. All members of the church should be encouraged to attend<br>
Sabbath School and bring visitors.<br>
Each Sabbath School should endeavor to provide appropriate age-level<br>
programs. Materials and resources are available from the conference, union,<br>
and division.<br>
Sabbath School should promote local and worldwide mission activities,<br>
the mission offering, and significant time for Bible study. (See Notes, #1,<br>
p. 179.)<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Announcements and Departmental Promotions</em></strong>—Thoughtful<br>
consideration should be given to the length and character of the<br>
announcements and departmental promotions during Sabbath services. If<br>
they deal with matters not specifically related to Sabbath worship or the<br>
work of the church, pastors and officers should exclude them, maintaining<br>
even in this respect a proper spirit of worship and Sabbath observance.<br>
Many churches issue printed bulletins giving the order of service and<br>
also the announcements for the week. Where this is done, there is little or<br>
no need for oral announcements. Where no such printed provision is made,<br>
many churches make the announcements before the worship service begins.<br>
(See Notes, #2, pp. 179, 180.)<br>
Proper consideration also should be given for the various departments<br>
to promote their programs, but great care should be exercised to safeguard<br>
the time needed for studying and preaching the Word of God.<br>

church meeting. Here members gather weekly to unite in worshipping God<br>
in a spirit of praise and thanksgiving, to hear the Word of God, to gather<br>
strength and grace to fight the battles of life, and to learn God’s will for<br>
them in soul-winning service. Reverence, simplicity, and promptness should<br>
characterize the service.<br>

meetings—how they shall be conducted so as to do the greatest amount of<br>
good, and leave the very best impression upon all who attend?”—RH,<br>
Apr. 14, 1885.<br>
“Our God is a tender, merciful Father. His service should not be looked<br>
upon as a heart-saddening, distressing exercise. It should be a pleasure to<br>
worship the Lord and to take part in His work. . . . Christ and Him crucified<br>
should be the theme of contemplation, of conversation, and of our most<br>
joyful emotion. . . . As we express our gratitude we are approximating to the<br>
worship of the heavenly hosts. ‘Whoso offereth praise glorifieth’ God.<br>
Psalm 50:23. Let us with reverent joy come before our Creator, with<br>
‘thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.’ Isaiah 51:3.”—SC 103, 104.<br>
                                                      <strong><em>Form of Service</em></strong>—The Sabbath morning service has two main<br>
divisions: the congregational response in praise and adoration, expressed in<br>
song, prayer, and gifts, and the message from the Word of God. (See Notes,<br>
#3, pp. 180, 181.)<br>
There is no set form or order for public worship. A short order of<br>
service is usually better suited to the real spirit of worship. Long<br>
preliminaries should be avoided. The opening exercises should not consume<br>
time required for the preaching of the Word of God. (For suggested forms<br>
of service, see Notes, #2, pp. 179, 180.)<br>

month is the Church Outreach (Missionary) Sabbath. This worship service<br>
focuses on lay evangelism and may feature plans and activities of various<br>
departments. “God has committed to our hands a most sacred work, and we<br>
need to meet together to receive instruction, that we may be fitted to<br>
perform this work.”—6T 32. (See Notes, #4, pp. 181, 182.)<br>

their prayers should be short, expressing just what they wanted, and no<br>
more. . . . One or two minutes is long enough for any ordinary prayer.”—<br>
2T 581.<br>
“Let those who pray and those who speak pronounce their words<br>
properly and speak in clear, distinct, even tones. Prayer, if properly offered,<br>
is a power for good. It is one of the means used by the Lord to communicate<br>
to the people the precious treasures of truth. . . . Let God’s people learn how<br>
to speak and pray in a way that will properly represent the great truths they<br>
possess. Let the testimonies borne and the prayers offered be clear and<br>
distinct. Thus God will be glorified.”—6T 382.<br>

service includes the ordinance of foot-washing followed by the Lord’s<br>
Supper. It should be a most sacred and joyous occasion to the congregation, pastor, and elders. The service usually takes place during the worship service but may be scheduled at other times.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Ordinance of Foot-Washing</em></strong>—“Now, having washed the disciples’<br>
feet, He said, ‘I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have<br>
done to you.’ In these words Christ was not merely enjoining the practice of<br>
hospitality. More was meant than the washing of the feet of guests to<br>
remove the dust of travel. Christ was here instituting a religious service. By<br>
the act of our Lord this . . . ceremony was made a consecrated ordinance. It<br>
was to be observed by the disciples, that they might ever keep in mind His<br>
lessons of humility and service.<br>
“This ordinance is Christ’s appointed preparation for the sacramental<br>
service. While pride, variance, and strife for supremacy are cherished, the<br>
heart cannot enter into fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared to<br>
receive the communion of His body and His blood. Therefore it was that<br>
Jesus appointed the memorial of His humiliation to be first observed.”—<br>
DA 650.<br>
In the act of washing the disciples’ feet, Christ performed a deeper<br>
cleansing, that of washing from the heart the stain of sin. The<br>
communicants sense an unworthiness to accept the sacred emblems before<br>
experiencing the cleansing that makes them “completely clean” (John<br>
13:10). Jesus desired to wash away “alienation, jealousy, and pride from<br>
their hearts. . . . Pride and self-seeking create dissension and hatred, but all<br>
this Jesus washed away. . . . Looking upon them, Jesus could say, ‘Ye are<br>
clean.’ ”—DA 646.<br>
The spiritual experience that lies at the heart of foot-washing lifts it<br>
from being a common custom to being a sacred ordinance. It conveys a<br>
                                                      <em>124 CHURCH MANUAL</em><br>
message of forgiveness, acceptance, assurance, and solidarity, primarily<br>
from Christ to the believer, but also between the believers themselves. This<br>
message is expressed in an atmosphere of humility.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>The Lord’s Supper</em></strong>—Angels declare that Jesus, the Redeemer of this<br>
world, is holy. Likewise, the symbols representing His body and His blood<br>
are holy. Since the Lord Himself selected the deeply meaningful symbols of<br>
the unleavened bread and unfermented fruit of the vine and used the<br>
simplest of means for washing the disciples’ feet, there should be great<br>
reluctance to introduce alternative symbols and means, except under<br>
emergency conditions, lest the original significance of the service be lost.<br>
Likewise in the order of service and the traditional roles played by the<br>
pastor, elders, deacons, and deaconesses, there should be caution lest<br>
substitution and innovation tend to make common that which is sacred.<br>
The service of the Lord’s Supper is just as holy today as it was when<br>
instituted by Jesus Christ. Jesus is still present when this sacred ordinance is<br>
celebrated. “It is at these, His own appointments, that Christ meets His<br>
people, and energizes them by His presence.”—DA 656.<br>
                                                      <br>

“Christ is still at the table on which the paschal supper has been spread. The<br>
unleavened cakes used at the Passover season are before Him. The Passover<br>
wine, untouched by fermentation, is on the table. These emblems Christ<br>
employs to represent His own unblemished sacrifice. Nothing corrupted by<br>
fermentation, the symbol of sin and death, could represent the ‘Lamb<br>
without blemish and without spot.’ 1 Peter 1:19.”—DA 653.<br>
Neither the wine nor the bread contained elements of fermentation<br>
because on the evening of the first day of the Hebrew Passover all leaven,<br>
or fermentation, had been removed from their dwellings (Ex. 12:15, 19;<br>
13:7). Therefore, only unfermented grape juice and unleavened bread are<br>
appropriate for use in the communion service, and great care must be<br>
exercised in providing these elements. In isolated areas where grape or<br>
raisin juice or concentrate is unavailable, the conference office will advise<br>
or assist.<br>

symbolizing Christ’s broken body and spilled blood, we in imagination join<br>
in the scene of Communion in the upper chamber. We seem to be passing<br>
through the garden consecrated by the agony of Him who bore the sins of<br>

was obtained. Christ is set forth crucified among us.”—DA 661.<br>

points to Christ’s second coming. It was designed to keep this hope vivid in<br>
the minds of the disciples. Whenever they met together to commemorate<br>
His death, they recounted how ‘he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave<br>
it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new<br>
testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto<br>
you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when<br>
I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.’ In their tribulation they<br>
found comfort in the hope of their Lord’s return. Unspeakably precious to<br>
them was the thought, ‘As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye<br>
do shew the Lord’s death till he come.’ 1 Cor. 11:26.”—DA 659.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Announcing the Communion Service</em></strong>—The communion service may<br>
appropriately be included as part of any Christian worship service.<br>
However, to give proper emphasis and make communion available to the<br>
greatest number of members, usually it is part of the worship service on the<br>
next to the last Sabbath of each quarter.<br>
On the preceding Sabbath an announcement should be made of the<br>
service calling attention to the importance of the forthcoming communion,<br>
so that all members may prepare their hearts and put aright any unresolved<br>
differences they have with one another. When they come to the table of the<br>
Lord the following Sabbath, they then can receive the intended blessing.<br>
Those absent for the announcement also should be invited to attend.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Conducting the Communion Service</em></strong>—Length of Service—Time is<br>
not the most significant factor in the communion service. However,<br>
attendance can be improved and the spiritual impact increased by<br>
(1) eliminating extraneous items from the worship service on this high day,<br>
(2) avoiding delays before and after foot-washing, and (3) having the<br>
deaconesses arrange the emblems on the communion table well beforehand.<br>
                                                      <em>Preliminaries</em>—The introductory portion of the service should be brief,<br>
including only short announcements, a hymn, prayer, offering, and a short<br>
sermon before separating for the foot-washing and returning for the Lord’s<br>
Supper.<br>
                                                      <em>Foot-Washing</em>—Each church should have a plan for meeting the needs<br>
of its members for the foot-washing service. (See Notes, #5, p. 182.)<br>
                                                      <em>Bread and Wine</em>—Following the foot-washing, the congregation comes<br>
together once again to partake of the bread and the wine. (See Notes, #6,<br>
pp. 182, 183.)<br>
                                                      <em>Celebration</em>—Communion should always be a solemn, never somber,<br>
experience. Wrongs have been righted, sins have been forgiven, and faith<br>
has been reaffirmed. It is a time for celebration. Let the music be bright and<br>
joyous. The service should end on a high note, such as with a musical<br>
feature or congregational singing, followed by dismissal.<br>
An offering for the poor is often taken as the congregation leaves.<br>
After the service the deacons and deaconesses clear the table, collect<br>
the utensils, and respectfully dispose of any remaining emblems. In no case<br>
should these emblems be consumed or returned to common use.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Who May Participate</em></strong>—The Church practices open communion. All<br>
who have committed their lives to the Savior may participate. Children<br>
learn the significance of the service by observing others participating. After<br>
receiving formal instruction in baptismal classes and making their<br>
commitment to Jesus in baptism, they are thereby prepared to partake in the<br>
service themselves.<br>
“Christ’s example forbids exclusiveness at the Lord’s Supper. It is true<br>
that open sin excludes the guilty. This the Holy Spirit plainly teaches.<br>
1 Cor. 5:11. But beyond this none are to pass judgment. God has not left it<br>
with men to say who shall present themselves on these occasions. For who<br>
can read the heart? Who can distinguish the tares from the wheat? ‘Let a<br>
man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that<br>
cup.’ For ‘whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord,<br>
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.’ ‘He that<br>
eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself,<br>
not discerning the Lord’s body.’ 1 Cor. 11:28, 27, 29. . . . There may come<br>
into the company persons who are not in heart servants of truth and<br>
holiness, but who may wish to take part in the service. They should not be<br>
forbidden. There are witnesses present who were present when Jesus<br>
washed the feet of the disciples and of Judas. More than human eyes beheld<br>
the scene.”—DA 656.<br>

                                                      <strong><em>Every Member Should Attend</em></strong>—“None should exclude themselves<br>
from the Communion because some who are unworthy may be present.<br>
Every disciple is called upon to participate publicly, and thus bear witness<br>
that he accepts Christ as a personal Savior. It is at these, His own<br>
appointments, that Christ meets His people, and energizes them by His<br>
presence. Hearts and hands that are unworthy may even administer the<br>
ordinance, yet Christ is there to minister to His children. All who come with<br>
their faith fixed upon Him will be greatly blessed. All who neglect these<br>
seasons of divine privilege will suffer loss. Of them it may appropriately be<br>
said, ‘Ye are not all clean.’ ”—DA 656.<br>

cannot for other reasons attend the communion service, the pastor or elder, possibly accompanied and assisted by a deacon or deaconess, may conduct a special service in their homes.<br>

should be the most interesting gatherings that are held, but these are<br>
frequently poorly managed. Many attend preaching, but neglect the prayer meeting. Here, again, thought is required. Wisdom should be sought of God, and plans should be laid to conduct the meetings so that they will be interesting and attractive. The people hunger for the bread of life. If they find it at the prayer meeting they will go there to receive it.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Long, prosy talks and prayers are out of place anywhere, and<br>
especially in the social [prayer] meeting. Those who are forward and ever<br>
ready to speak are allowed to crowd out the testimony of the timid and<br>
retiring. Those who are most superficial generally have the most to say.<br>
Their prayers are long and mechanical. They weary the angels and the<br>
people who listen to them. Our prayers should be short and right to the<br>
point. Let the long, tiresome petitions be left for the closet, if any have such<br>
to offer. Let the Spirit of God into your hearts, and it will sweep away all<br>
dry formality.”—4T 70, 71.<br>
More than ordinary efforts should be made to assure the success of the<br>
prayer meeting. The meeting should begin on time, even if only two or three persons are present. There should be a short, 15- to 20-minute Scripture study or presentation from the Spirit of Prophecy, followed by prayer, testimonies, and a benediction.<br>
                                                      <br>
Vary the plan of the service from week to week. If members are unable to assemble at the usual place for prayer meeting, home meetings may be of great benefit.<br>

Adventist Church structure. Within the context of those roles, the business meeting is the constituency meeting of the local church. (See p. 27) Members in regular standing are encouraged to attend and are entitled to vote. A member under censure has no right to participate by voice or vote.<br>
                                                      <br>
Business meetings shall be held at least once a year. The pastor, or the<br>
board in consultation with and support of the pastor, calls the meeting.<br>
Business meetings typically are announced a week or two in advance at the<br>
regular Sabbath worship service, with detail as to time and place. The<br>
pastor, an elder arranged by the pastor, or, in some cases, the conference<br>
president, serves as chairperson of the business meeting.<br>
Each church decides what the quorum will be for future meetings.<br>
Votes by proxy or letter are not permitted.<br>
Major items should be decided at a regular or specially called business<br>
meeting.<br>
The business meeting has authority over the board and may delegate<br>
responsibilities to the board in addition to those already assigned by the<br>
                                                      <em>Church Manual</em>. (See pp. 129-132.)<br>
The business meeting agenda should include reports about the work of<br>
the church. At least once a year the agenda should include reports covering<br>
church activities. Based on those reports, a proposed plan of action for the<br>
next year, including an annual budget, should be presented for approval.<br>
When possible, reports and plans for the next year should be presented in<br>
writing. (See Notes, #7, pp. 183, 184.)<br>
In order to maintain a spirit of cooperation between the church and<br>
conference, the church shall secure counsel from conference officers on all major matters.<br>
                                                      <br>
Conference and union officers (president, secretary, treasurer) or their<br>
designee may attend without vote (unless granted by the church) any<br>
business meeting of any church in their territory. An action to allow voting is not required if the officer is currently a member of that congregation.<br>

board whose members have been elected during a church business meeting. <br>
                                                      <br>
Its chief concern is having an active discipleship plan in place, which<br>
includes both the spiritual nurture of the church and the work of planning<br>
and fostering evangelism.<br>
                                                      <br>
Included in church board responsibilities are:<br>
                                                      <br>
1. An active discipleship plan.<br>
2. Evangelism in all of its phases.<br>
3. Spiritual nurturing and mentoring of members.<br>
4. Maintenance of doctrinal purity.<br>
5. Upholding of Christian standards.<br>
6. Recommending changes in church membership.<br>
7. Oversight of church finances.<br>
8. Protection and care of church properties.<br>
9. Coordination of church departments.<br>
The gospel commission of Jesus tells us that making disciples, which<br>
includes baptizing and teaching, is the primary function of the church<br>
(Matt. 28:18-20). It is, therefore, also the primary function of the board,<br>
which serves as the chief committee of the church. When the board devotes<br>
its first interests and highest energies to involving every member in<br>
proclaiming the good news and making disciples, most problems are<br>
alleviated or prevented, and a strong, positive influence is felt in the<br>
spiritual life and growth of members.<br>
                                                      <strong><em>Spiritual Nurture</em></strong>—Christ’s love for the Church needs to be<br>
manifested within the Church by His followers. True discipleship entails not<br>
only Biblical teaching (Matt. 28:20), but also a passionate commitment to<br>
loving our fellow believers unconditionally. This was the heart of Christ’s<br>
message to His disciples as He faced the cross (John 15:9-13). Christ’s<br>
command to them applies to us: that we “love one another.” Ellen G.<br>
White’s powerful insight into this historical scene is still vital for us: “This<br>
love is the evidence of their discipleship.”—DA 677, 678.<br>
Therefore, it is one of the primary functions of the board to ensure that<br>
members are nurtured and mentored in a personal, dynamic relationship<br>
with Jesus Christ.<br>
                                                      <strong><em>Discipleship</em></strong>—The purpose of the Church as the body of Christ is to<br>
intentionally disciple members, so that they continue in an active and<br>
fruitful relationship with Christ and His Church.<br>
Discipleship is based on an ongoing, lifelong relationship with Jesus.<br>
The believer commits to “abiding in Christ” (John 15:8), to being trained<br>
for fruitful discipleship by sharing Jesus with others, as well as to leading<br>
other members to also be faithful disciples.<br>
The Church, individually and collectively, shares responsibility for<br>
ensuring that every church member remains part of the body of Christ.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Membership</em></strong>—The board is elected by the members at the time of the<br>
regular election officers. (See pp. 71, 72.) In addition to<br>
conference-appointed pastors, the church should elect a representative board<br>
that includes the following officers:<br>
Elders<br>
Head deacon<br>
Head deaconess<br>
Treasurer<br>
Clerk<br>
Interest coordinator<br>
Adventist Community Services leader or Dorcas Society leader<br>
Adventist Men’s coordinator<br>
Adventist Youth Ministries leader<br>
Adventurer Club director<br>
Ambassador Club leader<br>
Bible school coordinator<br>
Children’s ministries leader<br>
Church music coordinator<br>
Communication committee chairperson or communication secretary<br>
Education secretary/church school principal or head teacher<br>
Family ministries leader<br>
Health ministries leader<br>
Home and School Association leader<br>
Pathfinder Club director<br>
Personal ministries leader and secretary<br>
Public Campus Ministries leader/coordinator<br>
Publishing ministries coordinator Religious liberty leader<br>
Sabbath School superintendent<br>
Stewardship ministries leader<br>
Women’s ministries leader<br>
Young adults leader<br>
In some cases, depending on the size of the membership, the board may<br>
not include all of this list or may add additional members. The pastor<br>
appointed by the conference to serve the church always is a member of the<br>
board.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Officers</em></strong>—The chairperson of the board is the conference-appointed<br>
pastor. If the pastor prefers not to act in this capacity or is unable to be<br>
present, he/she may arrange for an elder to preside as chairperson.<br>
The clerk serves as secretary of the board and is responsible for<br>
recording, presenting, and preserving the minutes of the meetings.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Meetings</em></strong>—Because the work of the board is vital to the life, health,<br>
and growth of the church, it is recommended that it meet at least once each<br>
month, more frequently if needed. It is well to fix the monthly meeting time<br>
for the same week and the same day each month.<br>
The board meeting is announced at the regular Sabbath worship<br>
service, and all board members are urged to attend.<br>
Each church should determine at a business meeting the number of<br>
board members who must be present to constitute a quorum at future<br>
meetings.<br>
Votes by proxy or letter are not permitted.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Work of the Board</em></strong>—The board is responsible to: 1. Ensure that there<br>
is an active, ongoing discipleship plan in place, which includes both<br>
spiritual nurture and outreach ministries. This is the most important item for<br>
the board’s attention.<br>
2. Study membership lists and initiate plans for reconnecting<br>
(reclaiming) members who have separated from the church.<br>
3. Train local church leadership in how to encourage intentional<br>
spiritual growth in themselves and others.<br>
4. Evangelize the outreach (missionary) territory of the church. Once<br>
each quarter an entire meeting should be devoted to plans for evangelism.<br>
The board will study conference recommendations for evangelistic<br>
programs and methods and how they can be implemented locally. The<br>
pastor and the board will initiate and develop plans for public evangelistic<br>
meetings.<br>
5. Coordinate outreach programs for all church departments, although<br>
each department develops its plans for outreach within its own sphere. To<br>
avoid conflict in timing, competition in securing volunteers, and to achieve<br>
maximum beneficial results, coordination is essential. Before completing<br>
and announcing plans for any program, each department should submit its<br>
plans to the board for approval. The departments also report to the board on<br>
the progress and results of their outreach programs. The board may suggest<br>
how departmental programs can contribute to the preparation, conduct, and<br>
follow-up of a public evangelistic campaign.<br>
6. Encourage the personal ministries department to enlist all members<br>
and children in some form of personal outreach (missionary) service.<br>
Training classes should be conducted in various lines of outreach ministry.<br>
7. Encourage the interest coordinator to ensure that every interest is<br>
personally and promptly followed up by assigned laypersons.<br>
8. Encourage each department to report at least quarterly to the board<br>
and to members at business meetings or in Sabbath meetings in regards to<br>
spiritual nurture and evangelism.<br>
9. Receive regular reports. The board should consider details of<br>
church business and receive regular reports of the treasurer on the church’s<br>
finances. The board should study the membership record and inquire into<br>
the spiritual standing of all members and provide for visits to sick,<br>
discouraged, or backslidden members. Other officers should periodically<br>
report.<br>
10. Promote Adventist education.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Committees of the Board</em></strong>—The board should permit no other<br>
business to interfere with planning for evangelism. Should other business be too time-consuming, the board should appoint committees to care for<br>
specific areas of church business, such as finance or church building<br>
projects. Such committees will then make recommendations to the board. (See Notes, #8, p. 184.)<br>

consultative financial planning and budgeting process with a committee<br>
structure that can give detailed review to the ongoing financial planning and budgeting. In some cases, this may take the form of a finance committee. In other cases, in smaller churches, this process may be handled directly by the church board. If the church establishes a separate committee for this purpose, the responsibilities should include reviewing budget requests and the review of the annual operating budget as well as a review of the financial position of the church as reflected in the financial statements. The approval of the budget and the review of the financial statement shall then be recommended to the church board and onward to the business meeting of the church for action.<br>

offerings of His people. The Lord says, “Bring all the tithes into the<br>
storehouse, that there may be food in My house” (Mal. 3:10). The Church has followed this plan from its earliest days.<br>
                                                      <br>
“The system of tithes and offerings was intended to impress the minds<br>
of men with a great truth—that God is the source of every blessing to His<br>
creatures, and that to Him man’s gratitude is due for the good gifts of His<br>
providence.”—PP 525.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Tithes and offerings for God are an acknowledgment of His claim on<br>
us by creation, and they are also an acknowledgment of His claim by<br>
redemption. Because all our power is derived from Christ, these offerings<br>
are to flow from us to God. They are to keep ever before us the claim of<br>
redemption, the greatest of all claims, and the one that involves every<br>
other.”—6T 479.<br>
“The tithe is sacred, reserved by God for Himself. It is to be brought<br>
into His treasury to be used to sustain the gospel laborers in their work.”—<br>
9T 249.<br>
“He has given His people a plan for raising sums sufficient to make the<br>
enterprise self-sustaining. God’s plan in the tithing system is beautiful in its<br>
simplicity and equality. All may take hold of it in faith and courage, for it is<br>
divine in its origin. In it are combined simplicity and utility. . . . Every man,<br>
woman, and youth may become a treasurer for the Lord and may be an<br>
agent to meet the demands upon the treasury. Says the apostle: ‘Let every<br>
one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.’ ”—<br>
3T 388, 389.<br>
“God has made the proclamation of the gospel dependent upon the<br>
labors and the gifts of His people. Voluntary offerings and the tithe<br>
constitute the revenue of the Lord’s work. Of the means entrusted to man,<br>
God claims a certain portion—the tenth. He leaves all free to say whether or<br>
not they will give more than this.”—AA 74.<br>
“God has given special direction as to the use of the tithe. He does not<br>
design that His work shall be crippled for want of means. . . . The portion<br>
that God has reserved for Himself is not to be diverted to any other purpose than that which He has specified. Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe, to use according to their own judgment. They are not to use it for themselves in an emergency, nor to apply it as they see fit, even in what they may regard as the Lord’s work.”—9T 247.<br>

partners, responsible to manage them in harmony with His guidelines and principles. The divine counsel is that as His stewards, we are to “be found faithful” (1 Cor. 4:2). Though the question of stewardship covers many aspects of Christian life and experience, without doubt the stewardship of our means is vitally important. It concerns the entire Church family and involves our recognition of the sovereignty of God, His ownership of all things, and the bestowal of His grace upon our hearts.<br>
While this aspect of Christian stewardship concerns our material<br>
possessions, it nevertheless reacts upon our Christian experience. The Lord requires certain things of us, in order that He may do certain things for us.<br>
Our yielding obedience to what our heavenly Father requires places this<br>
phase of stewardship upon a high spiritual plane. He does not arbitrarily<br>
demand either that we serve Him or that we recognize Him with our gifts.<br>
But He has so arranged that when we work in harmony with Him in these<br>
things there will flow to our own hearts great spiritual blessings.<br>
“God desires all His stewards to be exact in following divine<br>
arrangements. They are not to offset the Lord’s plans by performing some<br>
deed of charity or giving some gift or some offering when or how they, the<br>
human agents, shall see fit. It is a very poor policy for men to seek to<br>
improve on God’s plan, and invent a makeshift, averaging up their good<br>
impulses on this and that occasion, and offsetting them against God’s<br>
requirements. God calls upon all to give their influence to His own<br>
arrangement.”—9T 248.<br>

responsibility that rest upon members as children of God and members of His body, the Church, all are encouraged to faithfully return a tithe, one tenth of their increase or personal income, into the denomination’s treasury.<br>

Tithe shall not be used in any way by the local church, but held in trust<br>
and remitted to the conference treasurer. Thus tithe from all the churches<br>
flows into the conference treasury, and percentages are forwarded to the<br>
next-higher level in accordance with General Conference and division<br>
working policies to meet the expenses of conducting the work of God in<br>
their respective spheres of responsibility and activity.<br>

tithe, see Notes, #1, p. 184.<br>
“A very plain, definite message has been given to me for our people. I<br>
am bidden to tell them that they are making a mistake in applying the tithe<br>
to various objects which, though good in themselves, are not the object to<br>

offerings to the Lord. The withholding of offerings is classed with<br>
withholding tithe and is called robbery (Mal. 3:8). Since the Church’s<br>
earliest days, members have given liberal offerings that have blessed and<br>
prospered God’s work.<br>
                                                      <br>
In addition to the traditional calendar of offerings program, where each<br>
offering taken is for a specific purpose, the General Conference has<br>
approved the combined offering system and the personal giving plan. The<br>
division committee is authorized to determine which plan(s) will be used in<br>
its territory.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Sabbath School Offerings</em></strong>—The Church’s most widely used and<br>
successful method of regular systematic giving is through Sabbath School<br>
offerings, which are devoted to world mission work.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Other Offerings</em></strong>—Other offerings are taken from time to time for<br>
world mission work and for general and local projects. When any offering is<br>
taken, all money collected, unless otherwise indicated by the donor, shall be<br>
counted as part of that particular offering.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Special Gifts to Fields</em></strong>—The financial support of the worldwide work<br>
of the Church is based on the budget system. Appropriations are made to<br>
the various fields on the basis of budgeted needs. This is a fair and equitable<br>
method of distributing the funds.<br>
Where special gifts outside the regular budget plan are made to a<br>
particular field, a disparity is created to the disadvantage of other fields. If<br>
such gifts are given for the purpose of starting new work, the work thus<br>
started may languish when the special gift is used up, or it may have to be<br>
included in the budget for its future support. Thus other fields, with perhaps<br>
greater needs but without the opportunity of making them known, would be<br>
deprived of their equitable part of general funds that would be diverted to<br>
the work started by special gifts.<br>
History has proved the wisdom of having members generously and<br>
loyally give their offerings and gifts through the accepted channels and<br>
knowing that every field shares in the benefits of their giving.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Assisting the Poor and Needy</em></strong>—Offerings for the poor and needy are<br>
taken to assist the members who require help. A reserve fund should be kept<br>
for such emergency cases. In addition, the church should take a benevolent<br>
attitude toward all in need, and the board may make appropriations from<br>
this fund to assist the church’s health and welfare work for families in the<br>
community.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Church Budget for Local Expenses</em></strong>—The most satisfactory method<br>
of providing for church expenses is the budget plan. Before the beginning of<br>
the new budget year, the board should prepare a budget of expenses for<br>
church activities during the next year. The budget should include all income<br>
and expenses, including those related to all departments. It should provide<br>
for such projected costs as utilities, insurance, maintenance, janitor service,<br>
funds for the poor and needy, and church school expense. (See Notes, #2,<br>
p. 185, for sample budget.)<br>
The budget should be presented to the church for its study and<br>
adoption, and for plans to assure that funds shall be provided to balance the budget during the coming year. Funds to meet the church expense budget may be raised by offerings or subscriptions. Members should be urged to support their local church in proportion to their financial circumstances.<br>

soliciting funds:<br>
                                                      <br>
1. No conference, church, or institution, without special counsel and<br>
arrangement, shall plan work requiring solicitation of funds from outside its territory. Any solicitation within its territory shall be in harmony with local, union, division, and General Conference policies. No authority is granted to denominational employees representing special interests in one part of the field to solicit help in any other part of the field or in any other conference without arrangement with and written authorization from conference officers where the fund-raising would take place.<br>
                                                      <br>
2. The following principles protect churches from unauthorized,<br>
fraudulent, and undenominational solicitation:<br>
a. Pastors and officers shall not grant the privilege of the pulpit<br>
to persons for fund-raising who have not been recognized or recommended<br>
by the conference. (See pp. 120, 121.) No permission shall be granted to<br>
solicit funds either publicly or privately without such recognition.<br>
b. All funds contributed for any cause in response to appeals<br>
shall be passed through regular church channels.<br>
c. Conference and church officers shall take such steps as may<br>
be necessary to prevent unauthorized or illegal public solicitation.<br>
3. No campaign other than the Annual Appeal (Ingathering or<br>
equivalent appeal), which involves using Appeal literature and containers<br>
with authorized Appeal labels, shall be conducted for the solicitation of<br>
money for either home or overseas mission work. Unions and conferences<br>
should prevent violations of this regulation.<br>
4. Interdivision employees visiting their home churches or otherwise<br>
communicating with their home bases are asked to solicit funds only for<br>
enterprises included in the budget of appropriations, working in cooperation<br>
with churches and conferences to raise the funds required to meet the<br>
appropriations on which our world mission work depends. All such funds<br>
shall be passed through regular channels.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Questionable Methods for Raising Funds</em></strong>—The local church should<br>
take a strong stand against questionable methods for raising money.<br>
“When money is raised for religious purposes, to what means do many<br>
churches resort? To bazaars, suppers, fancy fairs, even to lotteries and like<br>
devices. Often the place set apart for God’s worship is desecrated by<br>
feasting and drinking, buying, selling, and merrymaking. Respect for the<br>
house of God and reverence for His worship are lessened in the minds of<br>
the youth. The barriers of self-restraint are weakened. Selfishness, appetite,<br>
the love of display, are appealed to, and they strengthen as they are<br>
indulged.”—9T 91.<br>
“As God’s work extends, calls for help will come more and more<br>
frequently. . . . If professing Christians would faithfully bring to God their<br>
tithes and offerings, His treasury would be full. There would then be no<br>
occasion to resort to fairs, lotteries, or parties of pleasure to secure funds for<br>
the support of the gospel.”—AA 338.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Tithes and Offerings Not a Personal Trust Fund</em></strong>—Tithes and<br>
offerings donated by members to the Church do not create a trust fund for<br>
the future benefit of the givers. These funds shall be used for the current<br>
purposes for which they are given.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Financing Building Plans</em></strong>—Churches considering the purchase or<br>
erection of church or other buildings, or incurring debt of any kind, should<br>
counsel with conference officers before undertaking such financial<br>
obligations. In the purchase or building of church properties, in no case<br>
shall commitments be made or building operations begun until approval has<br>
been given by the conference and union committees. These committees will<br>
approve only after they have assured themselves that the financial<br>
arrangements conform to established policies. In giving financial counsel,<br>
the conference committee should consider the size of the congregation, its<br>
financial strength, and the location of the building.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Handling and Accounting for Funds</em></strong>—The gathering and handling<br>
of funds for the Lord’s work is a sacred responsibility. The proper channel<br>
through which these funds flow is first from members to the local church,<br>
where the treasurer receives the funds. (See pp. 82-86.) The treasurer<br>
disburses funds intended for local church purposes. The treasurer holds in<br>
trust and passes on to the conference treasurer funds intended for<br>
conference or general purposes. The treasurer of the local church works<br>
under the direction of the board. Treasurers of any level (local church,<br>
conference, union, or division/General Conference) do not act<br>
independently. They disburse funds only by action or authority of<br>
responsible committees.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong><em>Auditing</em></strong>—Every set of accounting records, from those of the local<br>
church to those of the General Conference, are subject to audit by auditors appointed for the purpose. This rule, which also applies to every<br>
denominationally affiliated institution, provides the maximum of safety in<br>
the handling of funds. (See pp. 85, 86.)<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>

complete transformation of nature. This means a death to self and sin and a resurrection to a new life as a new person in Christ Jesus.<br>
The heart of the Christian becomes the dwelling place of Christ by<br>
faith. This is brought about by “the contemplation of Christ, beholding<br>
Christ, ever cherishing the dear Savior as our very best and honored Friend, so that we would not in any action grieve and offend Him”—TM 387. Thus Christians “have the companionship of the divine presence,” and as we realize that presence, “our thoughts are brought into captivity to Jesus Christ” (TM 388) and our habits made to conform to the divine standard.<br>
                                                      <br>
We should bear in mind that “as a shield from temptation and an<br>
inspiration to purity and truth, no other influence can equal the sense of<br>
God’s presence.”—Ed 255.<br>
“No part of our conduct escapes observation. We cannot hide our ways<br>
from the Most High. . . . Every act, every word, every thought, is as<br>
distinctly marked as though there were only one person in the whole world,<br>
and the attention of heaven were centered upon him.”—PP 217, 218.<br>
God’s love extends to everyone, and to His children in particular. His<br>
ear is ever open to the appeals of His people, those who have turned from<br>
the world and given themselves to Him. Out of this sacred relationship<br>
grows a respect and a reverence that is manifested every day and<br>
everywhere.<br>
As Christians we are members of the royal family, children of the<br>
heavenly King. Therefore, we should say no word and perform no act that<br>
would bring dishonor upon “that noble name by which you are called”<br>
(James 2:7). We are reformers. In every phase of life we should “study<br>
carefully the divine-human character and constantly inquire, ‘What would<br>
Jesus do were He in my place?’ This should be the measurement of our<br>
duty.”—MH 491.<br>
Through the remnant Church God will demonstrate to the entire<br>
universe the adequacy of the gospel to save men and women from the<br>
power of sin. As members of that Church we should emphasize again the great Bible standards and renew allegiance to these God-given principles.<br>
                                                      <br>
We should come up to the high standards of the Christian life and be<br>
separated from the world. To this end we would heed the Lord’s<br>
admonition: “Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone<br>
loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 John 2:15).<br>

habit of devotional Bible study and prayer if we are to perfect holiness. In a time when a flood of communication pours forth from the printed page,<br>
radio, television, the Internet, and other modern mass media, when<br>
thousands of voices plead for a hearing, we must close our eyes and our ears to much that seeks entrance to our minds and devote ourselves to God’s Book, the Book of all books, the Book of life—the Bible. If we cease to be the people of the Book, we are lost, and our mission has failed. Only as we daily talk to God in prayer and listen to His voice can we hope to live the life that is “hidden with Christ in God” (Col. 3:3) and finish His work.<br>
                                                      <br>
Prayer is a two-way conversation in which we listen to and talk to God.<br>
“Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend.”—SC 93.<br>
“Through sincere prayer we are brought into connection with the mind of<br>
the Infinite,” and “without unceasing prayer and diligent watching we are in<br>
danger of growing careless and of deviating from the right path.”—<br>
SC 97, 95.<br>
                                                      <br>
The home is the cornerstone of the Church. A Christian home is a<br>
house of prayer. “Fathers and mothers, however pressing your business, do not fail to gather your family around God’s altar. . . . Those who would live patient, loving, cheerful lives must pray.”—MH 393.<br>

for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ” (Phil. 3:20), we are yet in the world as an integral part of human society and must share with our fellow citizens certain responsibilities in the common problems of life. Wherever we live, as children of God we should be recognized as outstanding citizens in our Christian integrity and in working for the common good.<br>
                                                      <br>
While our highest responsibility is to the Church and the gospel<br>
commission, we should support by our service and our means, as far as<br>
possible and consistent with our beliefs, efforts for social order and<br>
betterment. Even though we must stand apart from political and social<br>
strife, we should always, quietly and firmly, maintain an uncompromising<br>
stand for justice and right in civic affairs, along with full adherence to our<br>
religious convictions. It is our sacred responsibility to be loyal citizens of<br>
the nations to which we belong, rendering “to Caesar the things that are<br>
Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” (Matt. 22:21).<br>

God’s power in the original creation and also a sign of His power to<br>
re-create and sanctify our lives (Eze. 20:12), and its observance is an<br>
evidence of our loyalty to Him and of our fellowship with Him.<br>
The Sabbath holds a special place in our lives. The seventh day of the<br>
week, from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday (Lev. 23:32), is a gift from<br>
God, a sign of His grace in time. It is a privilege, a special appointment with the One who loves us and whom we love, a sacred time set aside by God’s eternal law, a day of delight for worshipping God and sharing with others (Isa. 58:13). We welcome the Sabbath with joy and gratitude.<br>
“The Sabbath—oh!—make it the sweetest, the most blessed day of the<br>
whole week.”—FLB 36.<br>
                                                      <br>
“The Sabbath . . . is God’s time, not ours; when we trespass upon it we<br>
are stealing from God. . . . God has given us the whole of six days in which<br>
to do our work, and has reserved only one to Himself. This should be a day<br>
of blessing to us—a day when we should lay aside all our secular matters<br>
and center our thoughts upon God and heaven. . . .<br>
“We are not to teach our children that they must not be happy on the<br>
Sabbath, that it is wrong to walk out of doors. Oh, no. Christ led His<br>
disciples out by the lakeside on the Sabbath day and taught them. His<br>
sermons on the Sabbath were not always preached within enclosed<br>
walls.”—HP 152.<br>
“God’s love has set a limit to the demands of toil. Over the Sabbath He<br>
places His merciful hand. In His own day He preserves for the family<br>
opportunity for communion with Him, with nature, and with one<br>
another.”—Ed 251.<br>
The Sabbath hours belong to God and are to be used for Him alone.<br>
Our own pleasure, words, business, and thoughts should find no place in the<br>
observance of the Lord’s day (Isa. 58:13). Let us gather in the family circle<br>
at sunset and welcome the Sabbath with prayer and song, and let us close<br>
the day with prayer and expressions of gratitude for His wondrous love. The<br>
Sabbath is a special day for worship in our homes and churches, a day of<br>
joy to ourselves and our children, a day in which we can learn more of God<br>
through the Bible and the great lesson book of nature. It is a time we can<br>
visit the sick and work for the salvation of souls. We should lay aside the<br>
ordinary affairs of the six working days and perform no unnecessary work.<br>
We should not let secular media occupy our time on God’s holy day.<br>
“The Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless inactivity. The<br>
law forbids secular labor on the rest day of the Lord; the toil that gains a<br>
livelihood must cease; no labor for worldly pleasure or profit is lawful upon<br>
that day; but as God ceased His labor of creating, and rested upon the<br>
Sabbath and blessed it, so man is to leave the occupations of his daily life, and devote those sacred hours to healthful rest, to worship, and to holy deeds.”—DA 207.<br>
                                                      <br>
A program of activities in harmony with the spirit of true Sabbathkeeping will make this blessed day the happiest and best of all the week for ourselves and for our children—a veritable foretaste of our heavenly rest.<br>

love will always manifest a spirit of deep reverence for God, His Word, and His worship. “Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment of all who come into the presence of God.”—PP 252. We will recognize that “the hour and place of prayer are sacred, because God is there.”—GW 178. <br>
                                                      <br>
We will come to the house of worship, not carelessly, but in the<br>
spirit of meditation and prayer, and will avoid unnecessary conversation.<br>
As parents we should reverently instruct our children how they should<br>
behave in “the house of God” (1 Tim. 3:15). Faithful instruction and<br>
discipline of youth at home, Sabbath School, and church regarding<br>
reverence for God and His worship will go far in holding their loyalty in<br>
afteryears.<br>
                                                      <br>
Pastors who sense the sacredness of God’s service will, by example,<br>
instruction, and conduct in the pulpit, foster reverence, simplicity, good<br>
order, and decorum in the church.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>

mental and spiritual vigor are in great degree dependent upon physical<br>
strength and activity; whatever promotes physical health promotes the<br>
development of a strong mind and a well-balanced character.”—Ed 195.<br>
For this reason, we live intelligently in accordance with health<br>
principles of physical exercise, respiration, sunshine, pure air, use of water, sleep, and rest. By conviction we choose to eat healthfully, wear suitable clothing, practice cleanliness, engage in proper recreation, and freely choose to follow the principles of health, self-control, and wholesome diet.<br>
                                                      <br>
Therefore we abstain from all forms of alcohol, tobacco, and addictive<br>
drugs. We strive to preserve our physical and psychological balance by<br>
avoiding any excess.<br>
Health reform and the teaching of health and temperance are<br>
inseparable parts of the Church’s message. Instruction came to us through<br>
the Lord’s messenger “that those who are keeping His commandments must<br>
be brought into sacred relationship to Himself, and that by temperance in<br>
eating and drinking they must keep mind and body in the most favorable<br>
condition for service.”—CH 132. Also, “it is the Lord’s design that the<br>
restoring influence of health reform shall be a part of the last great effort to<br>
proclaim the gospel message.”—MM 259.<br>
We belong to God, body, soul, and spirit. It is therefore our religious<br>
duty to observe the laws of health, both for our own well-being and<br>
happiness and for more efficient service to God and society. We must keep<br>
our appetites under control. God has furnished us with a liberal variety of<br>
foods sufficient to satisfy every dietary need. “Fruits, grains, and<br>
vegetables, prepared in a simple way, . . . make, with milk or cream, the<br>
most healthful diet.”—CD 92.<br>
When we practice the principles of healthful living, we will not feel the<br>
need for stimulants. Nature’s law forbids our use of intoxicants and<br>
narcotics of any kind. From the early days of this movement abstinence<br>
from the use of liquor and tobacco has been a condition of membership.<br>
(See pp. 46, 48, 62, 93, 170.)<br>
                                                      <br>
God has given us great light on the principles of health, and modern<br>
scientific research has abundantly verified these principles.<br>

world. Our religion must have a molding influence on all our activities. Our habits must stem from principle and not from the example of the world. <br>
                                                      <br>
Customs and fashions may change, but principles of right conduct remain the same. Early in our history Ellen G. White wrote that the purpose of Christian dress is “to protect the people of God from the corrupting influence of the world, as well as to promote physical and moral health.”—4T 634. <br>
                                                      <br>
She also counsels that we should avoid gaudy display and profuse<br>
ornamentation, fads and extreme fashions, particularly those transgressing<br>
the laws of modesty, and that our clothing should be, when possible, “of<br>
good quality, of becoming colors, and suited for service” “rather than<br>
display.” Our attire should be characterized by modesty, “beauty,” “grace,”<br>
and “appropriateness of natural simplicity.”—MYP 351, 352.<br>
The people of God should always be found among the conservatives in<br>
dress, and will not let “the dress question fill the mind.”—Ev 273.<br>
“To dress plainly, abstaining from display of jewelry and ornaments of<br>
every kind, is in keeping with our faith.”—3T 366. It is clearly taught in the<br>
Scriptures that the wearing of jewelry is contrary to the will of God. The<br>
apostle Paul admonishes us to dress ourselves “in modest apparel, with<br>
propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly<br>
clothing” (1 Tim. 2:9). The wearing of ornaments of jewelry is a bid for<br>
attention not in keeping with Christian self-forgetfulness.<br>
In some countries and cultures the custom of wearing the wedding ring<br>
is considered imperative, having become, in the minds of the people, a<br>
criterion of virtue, and hence it is not regarded as an ornament. Under such<br>
circumstances we do not condemn the practice.<br>
Let us remember that it is not outward adornment that expresses true<br>
Christian character, but “the hidden person of the heart, with the<br>
incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in<br>
the sight of God” (1 Peter 3:3, 4). We should avoid the use of cosmetics not<br>
in keeping with good taste and the principles of Christian modesty.<br>
We should observe cleanliness and Christlike deportment as we seek at<br>
all times to please and rightly represent Christ our Lord. Christian parents by example, instruction, and authority should lead their sons and daughters to attire themselves modestly, and thus win the respect and confidence of&nbsp; those who know them. Let us consider ourselves well dressed only when we meet the demands of modesty by wearing tasteful, conservative clothing.<br>

beginning. We must continue to be a people called to live a simple life.<br>
Increase of pomp in religion always parallels a decline in spiritual power.<br>
                                                      <br>
As “the life of Jesus presented a marked contrast” to the display and ostentation of His time (Ed 77), so the simplicity and power of our message must be in marked contrast to the worldly display of our day. The Lord condemns “needless, extravagant expenditure of money to gratify pride and love of display.”—TM 179. In harmony with these principles, simplicity and economy should characterize our graduating exercises, our weddings, and all other church services.<br>

renewal and strengthening (2 Cor. 4:6). Our minds are the measure of our persons. Food for our minds is of the utmost importance in developing character and in carrying out our life’s purposes. For this reason we should carefully evaluate our mental habits. What we choose to read, hear, and watch, whether by book or magazine, radio or television, the Internet, or other modern media shapes and impacts our character.<br>
                                                      <br>
Books and other literature are among the most valuable means of<br>
education and culture, but these must be well chosen and rightly used.<br>
There is a wealth of good literature, but equally there is a flood of literature,<br>
often in most attractive guise, that damages minds and morals. The tales of<br>
wild adventure and of moral laxness, whether fact or fiction, however<br>
presented, are unfit for Christians of any age.<br>
“Those who indulge the habit of racing through an exciting story are<br>
simply crippling their mental strength and disqualifying their minds for<br>
vigorous thought and research.”—CT 135. Along with other evil results<br>
from the habit of reading fiction, we are told that “it unfits the soul to<br>
contemplate the great problems of duty and destiny” and “creates a distaste<br>
for life’s practical duties.”—CT 383.<br>
Radio, television, and the Internet have changed the whole atmosphere<br>
of our modern world and have brought us within easy contact with the life,<br>
thought, and activities of the entire globe. They can be great educational<br>
agencies through which we can enlarge our knowledge of world events and<br>
enjoy important discussions and the best in music.<br>
Unfortunately, however, modern mass media also can bring to their<br>
audiences almost continuous theatrical and other performances with<br>
influences that are neither wholesome nor uplifting. If we are not<br>
discriminating, they will bring sordid programs right into our homes.<br>
Safety for ourselves and our children is found in a determination, by<br>
God’s help, to follow the admonition of the apostle Paul: “Finally . . .<br>
whatever things are true . . . noble . . . just . . . pure . . . lovely . . . of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things” (Phil. 4:8).<br>

A vigorous, wholesome mind will not require worldly amusement but will<br>
find a renewal of strength in good recreation.<br>
                                                      <br>
“Many of the amusements popular in the world today, even with those<br>
who claim to be Christians, tend to the same end as did those of the heathen. <br>
                                                      <br>
There are indeed few among them that Satan does not turn to account in<br>
destroying souls. Through the drama he has worked for ages to excite<br>
passion and glorify vice. The opera, with its fascinating display and<br>
bewildering music, the masquerade, the dance, the card table, Satan<br>
employs to break down the barriers of principle and open the door to<br>
sensual indulgence. In every gathering for pleasure where pride is fostered<br>
or appetite indulged, where one is led to forget God and lose sight of eternal<br>
interests, there Satan is binding his chains about the soul.”—PP 459, 460.<br>
(See p. 170.)<br>
We must avoid anything that dramatizes, graphically presents, or<br>
suggests the sins and crimes of humanity—murder, adultery, robbery, and<br>
similar evils, which to a large degree are responsible for the breakdown of<br>
morality. Instead, we should find delight in God’s great world of nature and<br>
in the romance of human agencies and divine workings.<br>
Social dancing is another form of amusement with an evil influence.<br>
“The amusement of dancing . . . is a school of depravity, a fearful curse to<br>
society.”—MYP 399. (See 2 Cor. 6:15-18; 1 John 2:15-17; James 4:4;<br>
2 Tim. 2:19-22; Eph. 5:8-11; Col. 3:5-10.)<br>
Recreation is essential. But instead of joining the multitudes who are<br>
“lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God” (2 Tim. 3:4), we should<br>
endeavor to make our friendships and recreations both Christ-centered and church-centered.<br>

which is pure, noble, and elevating, and to awaken in the soul devotion and gratitude to God.”—PP 594. Jesus “held communion with heaven in<br>
song.”—DA 73.<br>
                                                      <br>
Music is one of the highest arts. Good music not only gives us pleasure<br>
but elevates our minds and cultivates our finest qualities. God often has<br>
used spiritual songs to touch the hearts of sinners and lead to repentance.<br>
                                                      <br>
On the contrary, debased music breaks down morality and draws us away from our relationship with God.<br>
                                                      <br>
We should exercise great care in the choice of music in our homes,<br>
social gatherings, schools, and churches. Any melody partaking of the<br>
nature of jazz, rock, or related hybrid forms, or any language expressing<br>
foolish or trivial sentiments, will be shunned. (See pp. 94, 99, 149.)<br>

mutual contact minds receive polish and refinement; by social intercourse, acquaintances are formed and friendships contracted which result in a unity of heart and an atmosphere of love which is pleasing in the sight of heaven.”—6T 172.<br>
                                                      <br>
Proper association of the sexes is beneficial to both. Such association<br>
should be conducted upon a high plane and with regard for the social<br>
conventions that have been prescribed for our protection. It is the purpose of Satan to pervert every good thing, and the perversion of the best often leads to that which is worst.<br>
                                                      <br>
Today the ideals that make these social relationships safe and happy are<br>
breaking down to an alarming degree. Under the influence of passion<br>
unrestrained by moral and religious principle, the association of the sexes<br>
has to a large extent degenerated into freedom and license, sexual<br>
perversions, incest, and sexual abuse of children.<br>
Millions have abandoned biblical standards of conduct and are<br>
bartering the sacred experiences of marriage and parenthood for the bitter,<br>
remorseful fruits of sin. Not only are these evils damaging the familial<br>
structure of society, but the breakdown of the family in turn fosters and<br>
breeds these and other evils. The results in distorted lives of children and<br>
youth are distressing. The effects on society are both disastrous and<br>
cumulative.<br>
These evils have become more open and threatening to the ideals and<br>
purposes of the Christian home. Adultery, pornography, abuse of any kind<br>
(including sexual abuse of spouses, children, and the elderly), incest, and<br>
homosexual and lesbian practices are among the perversions of God’s<br>
original plan and illustrate the brokenness of humanity. As the intent of<br>
clear passages of Scripture (see Ex. 20:14; Lev. 18:22, 29; 20:13;<br>
1 Cor. 6:9; 1 Tim. 1:10; Rom. 1:20-32) is denied and as their warnings are<br>
rejected in exchange for human opinions, much uncertainty and confusion<br>
prevail. Since ancient times and civilizations Satan’s plan always has been<br>
to cause people to forget that God is their Creator and that when He created<br>
humankind in His own image, He created both “male and female”<br>
(Gen. 1:27).<br>
Though God’s Word alerts us to the degrading results of the world’s<br>
obsession with sex and the pursuit of sensual pleasure, Christ came to<br>
destroy the works of Satan and reestablish the relationship of humans with<br>
their Creator. Though fallen in Adam and captive to sin, when we are in<br>
Christ we receive full pardon and the right to choose anew the better way to<br>
complete renewal. By means of the cross and the power of the Holy Spirit,<br>
we all may be freed from the grip of sinful practices as we are restored to<br>
the image of our Creator.<br>
As parents and spiritual guides of youth, we must gain a sympathetic<br>
understanding of their problems, seek to provide for them a Christian social<br>
environment, and spiritually draw near to them so we can impart the ideals,<br>
inspiration, and power of Christianity.<br>
Whatever may be the mistakes of our parents or peers, it is our<br>
responsibility and privilege to know and to hold the highest ideals of<br>
Christian manhood and womanhood. We can build Christian character that<br>
will buttress us against evil and make us uplifting influences in society by<br>
reverent Bible study, a deep acquaintance with the works of nature, rigorous<br>
guarding of the sacred powers of the body, earnest purpose, constancy in<br>
prayer, and sincere, unselfish ministry to others.<br>
Social gatherings for both young and old should be occasions for happy<br>
fellowship and improvement of the powers of mind and soul, not for light<br>
and trifling amusement. Good music, elevating conversation, good<br>
recitations, suitable still or motion pictures, games carefully selected for<br>
educational value, and, above all, the making and using of plans for<br>
outreach (missionary) effort will bless and strengthen the lives of all. The<br>
Youth Ministries Department of the General Conference has published<br>
helpful information and practical suggestions for the conduct of social<br>
gatherings and for guidance in other social relations.<br>
Our homes are by far the best places for social gatherings. In large<br>
centers where it is impossible to hold such gatherings in homes and where there is no social center of our own, we should secure a place free from influences destructive of Christian standards, rather than a place ordinarily used for commercial amusements and sports, such as social halls and skating rinks, which can suggest an atmosphere contrary to Christian standards.<br>

with young people, is one of the most wholesome influences in the lives of children and youth. “There is danger that both parents and teachers . . . fail to come sufficiently into social relation with their children or scholars.”—CT 76. It is the duty of our homes, schools, and other institutions to care for the morals and reputation of those placed in our charge. As parents we should strongly support the regulations of the institutions serving our youth and children, and we should institute equal safeguards in our homes. To make this possible, we must learn how to be welcome companions of our children. But it rests chiefly upon the young people themselves to make chaperonage an honored and happy relationship.<br>

characterized by modesty, simplicity, sincerity, and an earnest purpose to please and honor God. Marriage affects the afterlife both in this world and in the world to come. A sincere Christian will make no plans that God cannot approve.”—MH 359.<br>
                                                      <br>
Failure to follow these principles in Christian courtship may lead to<br>
tragedy. Unity of husband and wife in ideals and purposes is a requisite to a<br>
happy and successful home. Differences of partners regarding religion are<br>
likely to mar the happiness of the home and lead to confusion, perplexity,<br>
and failure in child rearing. The Bible advises, “Do not be unequally yoked<br>
together with unbelievers” (2 Cor. 6:14).<br>
“The family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred, of any on<br>
earth. It was designed to be a blessing to mankind. And it is a blessing<br>
wherever the marriage covenant is entered into intelligently, in the fear of<br>
God, and with due consideration for its responsibilities.”—AH 18.<br>
Worship of God, Sabbathkeeping, recreation, association, use of<br>
financial resources, and training of children are components of happy<br>
family relationships. Because differences in these areas can often lead to a<br>
deterioration of these relationships, to discouragement, and even to<br>
complete loss of Christian experience, an adequate preparation for marriage<br>
should include premarital pastoral counseling in these areas.<br>
“ ‘Can two walk together, except they be agreed?’ Amos 3:3. The<br>
happiness and prosperity of the marriage relation depends upon the unity of<br>
the parties; but between the believer and the unbeliever there is a radical<br>
difference of tastes, inclinations, and purposes. They are serving two<br>
masters, between whom there can be no concord. However pure and correct<br>
one’s principles may be, the influence of an unbelieving companion will<br>
have a tendency to lead away from God.”—PP 174.<br>
The Spirit of Prophecy consistently counsels against marriage between<br>
“the believer and the unbeliever” and further cautions against uniting with<br>
fellow Christians who have “not accepted the truth for this time.”—5T 364.<br>
Marriages are more likely to endure, and family life to fulfill the divine<br>
plan, if husband and wife are united and are bound together by common<br>
spiritual values and lifestyles. For these reasons the Church strongly<br>
discourages marriage between a Seventh-day Adventist and a member of<br>
another religion and strongly urges its pastors not to perform such<br>
marriages.<br>
The Church recognizes that it is the prerogative of each individual<br>
member to make the final decision relative to the choice of a marriage<br>
partner. However, it is the hope of the Church that if the member chooses a<br>
partner who is not a member of the Church, the couple will realize and<br>
appreciate that the Seventh-day Adventist pastor, who has covenanted to<br>
uphold the principles outlined above, should not be expected to perform the marriage.<br>
                                                      <br>
If a member does enter into such a marriage, the church is to demonstrate love and concern with the purpose of encouraging the couple toward complete unity in Christ.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>

Fall, when everything, including marriage, was “very good” (Gen. 1:31).<br>
“Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his<br>
wife, and they shall become one flesh” (Gen. 2:24). “God celebrated the<br>
first marriage. Thus the institution has for its originator the Creator of the<br>
universe. ‘Marriage is honourable’; it was one of the first gifts of God to<br>
man, and it is one of the two institutions that, after the fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of Paradise.”—AH 25, 26.<br>
                                                      <br>
God intended the marriage of Adam and Eve to be the pattern for all<br>
future marriages, and Christ endorsed this original concept: “Have you not<br>
read that He who made them at the beginning ‘made them male and<br>
female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother<br>
and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So then,<br>
they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined<br>
together, let not man separate” (Matt. 19:4-6). Marriage, thus instituted by<br>
God, is a monogamous, heterosexual relationship between one male and<br>
one female.<br>
As such, marriage is a public, lawfully binding lifelong commitment of<br>
a man and a woman to each other and between the couple and God<br>
(Mark 10:2-9; Rom. 7:2). Paul indicates that the commitment that Christ has<br>
for the church is a model of the relationship between husband and wife<br>
(Eph. 5:31, 32). God intended marriage to be as permanent as Christ’s<br>
relationship with the church.<br>
Sexual intimacy within marriage is a sacred gift from God to the human<br>
family. It is an integral part of marriage, reserved for marriage only<br>
(Gen. 2:24; Prov. 5:5-20). Such intimacy, designed to be shared exclusively<br>
between husband and wife, promotes ever-increasing closeness, happiness,<br>
and security, and provides for the perpetuation of the human race.<br>
Unity in marriage is achieved by mutual respect and love. No one is<br>
superior (Eph. 5:21-28). “Marriage, a union for life, is a symbol of the<br>
union between Christ and His church. The spirit that Christ manifests<br>
toward the church is the spirit that husband and wife are to manifest toward<br>
each other.”—7T 46. God’s Word condemns violence in personal<br>
relationships (Gen. 6:11, 13; Ps. 11:5; Isa. 58:4, 5; Rom. 13:10;<br>
Gal. 5:19-21). It is the spirit of Christ to love and accept, to seek to affirm<br>
and build others up, rather than to abuse or demean them (Rom. 12:10;<br>
14:19; Eph. 4:26; 5:28, 29; Col. 3:8-14; 1 Thess. 5:11). There is no room<br>
among Christ’s followers for tyrannical control and the abuse of power<br>
(Matt. 20:25-28; Eph. 6:4). Violence in the setting of marriage and family is<br>
abhorrent (see AH 343).<br>
“Neither husband nor wife is to make a plea for rulership. The Lord has<br>
laid down the principle that is to guide in this matter. The husband is to<br>
cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the church. And the wife is to respect<br>
and love her husband. Both are to cultivate the spirit of kindness, being<br>
determined never to grieve or injure the other.”—7T 47.<br>
The entrance of sin adversely affected marriage. When Adam and Eve<br>
sinned, they lost the oneness that they had known with God and with each<br>
other (Gen. 3:6-24). Their relationship became marked with guilt, shame,<br>
blame, and pain. Wherever sin reigns, its sad effects on marriage include<br>
alienation, unfaithfulness, neglect, abuse, sexual perversion, domination of<br>
one partner by the other, violence, separation, desertion, and divorce.<br>
Marriages involving more than one husband and one wife are also an<br>
expression of the effects of sin on the institution of marriage. Such<br>
marriages, though practiced in Old Testament times, are not in harmony<br>
with the divine design. God’s plan for marriage requires His people to<br>
transcend the mores of popular culture that conflict with the biblical view.<br>
The Christian concept of marriage includes the following:<br>
1. <em>Divine Ideal to Be Restored in Christ</em>—In redeeming the world<br>
from sin and its consequences, God seeks to restore marriage to its original<br>
ideal. This is envisioned for the lives of those who have been born again<br>
into Christ’s kingdom, those whose hearts are being sanctified by the Holy<br>
Spirit and who have as their primary purpose the exaltation of the Lord<br>
Jesus Christ. (See also 1 Peter 3:7; TMB 64.)<br>
2. <em>Oneness and Equality to Be Restored in Christ</em>—The gospel<br>
emphasizes the love and submission of husband and wife to one another<br>
(1 Cor. 7:3, 4; Eph. 5:21). The model for the husband’s leadership is the<br>
self-sacrificial love and service that Christ gives to the Church<br>
(Eph. 5:24, 25). Both Peter and Paul speak about the need for respect in the<br>
marriage relationship (1 Peter 3:7; Eph. 5:22, 23).<br>
3. <em>Grace Available for All</em>—God seeks to restore to wholeness and<br>
reconcile to Himself all who have failed to attain the divine standard<br>
(2 Cor. 5:19). This includes those who have experienced broken marriage<br>
relationships.<br>
4. <em>Role of the Church</em>—Moses in the Old Testament and Paul in the<br>
New Testament dealt with the problems caused by broken marriages<br>
(Deut. 24:1-5; 1 Cor. 7:11). Both, while upholding and affirming the ideal,<br>
worked constructively and redemptively with those who had fallen short of the divine standard. Similarly, the Church today is called to uphold and affirm God’s ideal for marriage and, at the same time, to be a forgiving, reconciling, healing community, showing understanding and compassion when brokenness occurs.<br>

(Matt. 19:3-8; Mark 10:2-9), but the Bible is not silent about it. Because<br>
divorce occurred as part of the fallen human experience, biblical legislation was given to limit the damage it caused (Deut. 24:1-4). The Bible consistently seeks to elevate marriage and to discourage divorce by describing the joys of married love and faithfulness (Prov. 5:18-20; Song of Sol. 2:16; 4:9-5:1), by referring to the marriage-like relationship of God<br>
with His people (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:1), by focusing on the possibilities of<br>
forgiveness and marital renewal (Hosea 3:1-3), and by indicating God’s<br>
abhorrence of divorce and the misery it causes (Mal. 2:15, 16). Jesus<br>
restored the creation view of marriage as a lifelong commitment between a<br>
man and a woman and between the couple and God (Matt. 19:4-6;<br>
Mark 10:6-9). Much biblical instruction affirms marriage and seeks to<br>
correct problems that tend to weaken or destroy the foundation of marriage<br>
(Eph. 5:21-33; Heb. 13:4; 1 Peter 3:7).<br>
Marriage rests on principles of love, loyalty, exclusiveness, trust, and<br>
support upheld by both partners in obedience to God (Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:6;<br>
1 Cor. 13; Eph. 5:21-29; 1 Thess. 4:1-7). When these principles are<br>
violated, Scripture acknowledges that tragic circumstances can destroy<br>
marriage.<br>
Divine grace is the only remedy for the brokenness of divorce. When<br>
marriage fails, former partners should be encouraged to examine their<br>
experience and to seek God’s will for their lives. God provides comfort to<br>
those who have been wounded. God also accepts the repentance of<br>
individuals who commit the most destructive sins, even those that carry<br>
with them irreparable consequences (2 Sam. 11; 12; Ps. 34:18; 86:5;<br>
Joel 2:12, 13; John 8:2-11; 1 John 1:9).<br>
Scripture recognizes adultery and fornication (Matt. 5:32) and<br>
abandonment by an unbelieving partner (1 Cor. 7:10-15) as grounds for<br>
divorce.<br>
                                                      <br>
There is no direct teaching in Scripture regarding remarriage after<br>
divorce. However, there is a strong implication in Jesus’ words in<br>
Matthew 19:9 that would allow the remarriage of one who has remained<br>
faithful but whose spouse has been unfaithful to the marriage vow.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Acknowledging the biblical teachings on marriage, the Church is aware<br>
that marriage relationships are less than ideal in many cases. The problem of divorce and remarriage can be seen in its true light only as it is viewed from Heaven’s viewpoint and against the background of the Garden of Eden.<br>
                                                      <br>
Central to God’s holy plan for our world was the creation of beings<br>
made in His image who would multiply and replenish the earth and live<br>
together in purity, harmony, and happiness. He brought forth Eve from the<br>
side of Adam and gave her to Adam as his wife. Thus was marriage<br>
instituted—God the author of the institution and the officiator at the first<br>
marriage. After the Lord had revealed to Adam that Eve was verily bone of<br>
his bone and flesh of his flesh, there could never arise a doubt in his mind<br>
that the two of them were one flesh. Nor could ever a doubt arise in the<br>
mind of either of the holy pair that God intended that their home should<br>
endure forever.<br>
The Church adheres to this view of marriage and the home without<br>
reservation, believing that any lowering of this high view is to that extent a<br>
lowering of the heavenly ideal. The belief that marriage is a divine<br>
institution rests upon the Holy Scriptures. Accordingly, all thinking and<br>
reasoning in the perplexing field of divorce and remarriage must constantly<br>
be harmonized with that holy ideal revealed in Eden.<br>
The Church believes in the law of God and also in the forgiving mercy<br>
of God. It believes that victory and salvation can as surely be found by<br>
those who have transgressed in the matter of divorce and remarriage as by<br>
those who have failed in any other of God’s holy standards.<br>
Nothing presented here is intended to minimize the mercy of God or<br>
the forgiveness of God. In the fear of the Lord, the Church here sets forth<br>
the principles and practices that should apply in this matter of marriage,<br>
divorce, and remarriage.<br>
Though marriage was first performed by God alone, it is recognized<br>
that people now live under civil governments; therefore, marriage has both<br>
divine and civil aspects. The divine aspect is governed by the laws of God,<br>
the civil by the laws of the state.<br>
In harmony with these teachings, the following statements set forth the<br>
position of the Church:<br>
1. When Jesus said, “Let not man put asunder,” He established a rule<br>
of conduct for the Church, under the dispensation of grace, that must<br>
transcend all civil enactments that would go beyond His interpretation of<br>
the divine law governing the marriage relation. Here He gives a rule to<br>
which His followers should adhere even if the state or prevailing custom<br>
allows larger liberty. “In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus declared plainly<br>
that there could be no dissolution of the marriage tie, except for<br>
unfaithfulness to the marriage vow.”—TMB 63. (Also see Matt. 5:32;<br>
19:9.)<br>
2. Unfaithfulness to the marriage vow has generally been seen to<br>
mean adultery or fornication. However, the New Testament word for<br>
fornication includes certain other sexual irregularities (1 Cor. 6:9; 1<br>
Tim. 1:9, 10; Rom. 1:24-27). Therefore, sexual perversions, including<br>
incest, child sexual abuse, and homosexual practices, are also recognized as<br>
a misuse of sexual powers and a violation of the divine intention in<br>
marriage. As such they are just cause for separation or divorce.<br>
Even though the Scriptures allow divorce for the reasons mentioned<br>
above, as well as for abandonment by an unbelieving spouse<br>
(1 Cor. 7:10-15), the church and those concerned should make earnest<br>
endeavors to effect a reconciliation, urging the spouses to manifest toward<br>
each other a Christlike spirit of forgiveness and restoration. The church is<br>
urged to relate lovingly and redemptively toward the couple in order to<br>
assist in the reconciliation process.<br>
3. In the event that reconciliation is not effected, the spouse who has<br>
remained faithful to the spouse who violated the marriage vow has the<br>
biblical right to secure a divorce and also to remarry.<br>
4. A spouse who has violated the marriage vow (see sections 1 and 2<br>
above) shall be subject to discipline by the local church. (See pp. 62-68.) If<br>
genuinely repentant, the spouse may be placed under censure for a stated<br>
period of time rather than removed from church membership. A spouse who<br>
gives no evidence of full and sincere repentance shall be removed from<br>
membership. In case the violation has brought public reproach on the cause<br>
of God, the church, in order to maintain its high standards and good name,<br>
may remove the individual from membership.<br>
Any of these forms of discipline shall be applied by the church in a<br>
manner that would seek to attain the two objectives of discipline—to correct<br>
and redeem. In the gospel of Christ, the redemptive side of discipline is<br>
always tied to an authentic transformation of the sinner into a new creature<br>
in Jesus Christ.<br>
5. A spouse who has violated the marriage vow and who is divorced<br>
does not have the moral right to marry another while the spouse who has<br>
been faithful to the marriage vow still lives and remains unmarried and<br>
chaste. The person who does so shall be removed from membership. The<br>
person whom he/she marries, if a member, also shall be removed from<br>
membership.<br>
6. It is recognized that sometimes marriage relations deteriorate to the<br>
point where it is better for a husband and wife to separate. “Now to the<br>
married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from her<br>
husband. But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be<br>
reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife”<br>
(1 Cor. 7:10, 11). In many such cases, the custody of children, the<br>
adjustment of property rights, or even personal protection may necessitate a<br>
change in marital status. In such cases it may be permissible in some<br>
countries to secure what is known as a legal separation. However, in some<br>
jurisdictions such a separation can be secured only by divorce.<br>
A separation or divorce that results from factors such as physical<br>
violence or in which “unfaithfulness to the marriage vow” (see sections 1<br>
and 2 above) is not involved does not give either one the scriptural right to<br>
remarry, unless in the meantime the other party has remarried, committed<br>
adultery or fornication, or died. Should a member who has been thus<br>
divorced remarry without these biblical grounds, he/she shall be removed<br>
from membership, and the one whom he/she marries, if a member, also<br>
shall be removed from membership. (See pp. 62-68.)<br>
7. A spouse who has violated the marriage vow and has been<br>
divorced and removed from membership and who has remarried, or a<br>
person who has been divorced on other than the grounds set forth in<br>
sections 1 and 2 above and has remarried, and who has been removed from<br>
membership, shall be considered ineligible for membership except as<br>
provided below.<br>
8. The marriage contract is not only sacred but also possibly more<br>
complex when, for example, it involves children. Hence, in a request for<br>
readmittance to membership, the options available to the repentant may be<br>
severely limited. Before final action is taken by the church, the request for<br>
readmittance shall be brought by the church through the pastor or district<br>
leader to the conference committee for counsel and recommendation of<br>
steps the repentant one, or ones, may take to secure readmittance.<br>
9. Readmittance to membership of those who have been removed for<br>
reasons given in the foregoing sections shall normally be on the basis of<br>
rebaptism. (See pp. 49, 67, 68.)<br>
10. When a person who has been removed from membership is<br>
readmitted to membership, as provided in section 8, every care should be<br>
exercised to safeguard the unity and harmony of the church by not giving<br>
that person responsibility as a leader, especially in an office that requires the rite of ordination, unless by very careful counsel with conference administration.<br>
                                                      <br>
11. No pastor has the right to officiate at the remarriage of any person<br>
who, under the stipulation of the preceding paragraphs, has no scriptural<br>
right to remarry.<br>
                                                   </span><br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">The Church as a redemptive agency of Christ is to minister to its<br>
members in all of their needs and to nurture everyone so that all may grow into a mature Christian experience. This is particularly true when members face lifelong decisions such as marriage and distressful experiences such as divorce. When a couple’s marriage is in danger of breaking down, every effort should be made by the partners and those in the church or family who minister to them to bring about their reconciliation in harmony with divine principles for restoring wounded relationships (Hosea 3:1-3; 1 Cor. 7:10, 11; 13:4-7; Gal. 6:1).<br>
                                                      <br>
Resources that can be of assistance to members in the development of a<br>
strong Christian home are available through the church or other church<br>
organizations. These resources include: (1) programs of orientation for<br>
couples engaged to be married, (2) programs of instruction for married<br>
couples with their families, and (3) programs of support for broken families<br>
and divorced individuals.<br>
Pastoral support is vital in the area of instruction and orientation in the<br>
case of marriage, and healing and restoration in the case of divorce. The<br>
pastoral function in the latter case is both disciplinary and supportive. That<br>
function includes the sharing of relevant information, some of which may<br>
be sensitive and must be handled with great discretion. However, this<br>
ethical concern alone should not be the grounds for avoiding disciplinary<br>
actions established in sections 1-11 above.<br>
Just as God forgives, members are called to forgive and to accept those<br>
who have failed (Isa. 54:5-8; Matt. 6:14, 15; Eph. 4:32). The Bible urges<br>
patience, compassion, and forgiveness in the Christian care of those who have erred (Matt. 18:10-20; Gal. 6:1, 2). While individuals are under<br>
discipline, either by censure or by being removed from membership, the<br>
church, as an instrument of God’s mission, shall make every effort to<br>
maintain caring and spiritually nurturing contact with them.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#1F3763;"><br>
                                                   </span><span style="color:#000000;">Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed and hold<br>
certain fundamental beliefs to be the teaching of the Holy Scriptures. These beliefs, as set forth here, constitute the church’s understanding and expression of the teaching of Scripture. Revision of these statements may be expected at a General Conference Session when the church is led by the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth or finds better language<br>
in which to express the teachings of God’s Holy Word.<br>
                                                      <br>
1. <em>The Holy Scriptures</em><br>
The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of<br>
God, given by divine inspiration. The inspired authors spoke and wrote as<br>
they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to<br>
humanity the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are<br>
the supreme, authoritative, and the infallible revelation of His will. They are<br>
the standard of character, the test of experience, the definitive revealer of<br>
doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God’s acts in history. (Ps. 119:105;<br>
Prov 30:5, 6; Isa. 8:20; John 17:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17;<br>
Heb. 4:12; 2 Peter 1:20, 21.)<br>
                                                      <br>
2. <em>The Trinity</em><br>
There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three<br>
coeternal Persons. God is immortal, all-powerful, all-knowing, above all,<br>
and ever present. He is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet<br>
known through His self-revelation. God, who is love, is forever worthy of<br>
worship, adoration, and service by the whole creation. (Gen. 1:26;<br>
Deut. 6:4; Isa. 6:8; Matt. 28:19; John 3:16; 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 13:14;<br>
Eph. 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2.)<br>
                                                      <br>
3. <em>The Father</em><br>
God the eternal Father is the Creator, Source, Sustainer, and Sovereign<br>
of all creation. He is just and holy, merciful and gracious, slow to anger,<br>
and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers<br>
exhibited in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also those of the Father.<br>
(Gen. 1:1; Deut. 4:35; Ps. 110:1, 4; John 3:16; 14:9; 1 Cor. 15:28;<br>
1 Tim. 1:17; 1 John 4:8; Rev. 4:11.)<br>
                                                      <br>
4. <em>The Son</em><br>
God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all<br>
things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of<br>
humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He<br>
became also truly human, Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy<br>
Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced temptation as<br>
a human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of<br>
God. By His miracles He manifested God’s power and was attested as<br>
God’s promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for<br>
our sins and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to heaven<br>
to minister in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in<br>
glory for the final deliverance of His people and the restoration of all things.<br>
(Isa. 53:4-6; Dan. 9:25-27; Luke 1:35; John 1:1-3, 14; 5:22; 10:30;<br>
14:1-3, 9, 13; Rom. 6:23; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4; 2 Cor. 3:18; 5:17-19; Phil. 2:5-11;<br>
Col. 1:15-19; Heb. 2:9-18; 8:1, 2.)<br>
                                                      <br>
5. <em>The Holy Spirit</em><br>
God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in<br>
Creation, incarnation, and redemption. He is as much a person as are the<br>
Father and the Son. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ’s<br>
life with power. He draws and convicts human beings; and those who<br>
respond He renews and transforms into the image of God. Sent by the<br>
Father and the Son to be always with His children, He extends spiritual gifts<br>
to the church, empowers it to bear witness to Christ, and in harmony with<br>
the Scriptures leads it into all truth. (Gen. 1:1, 2; 2 Sam. 23:2; Ps. 51:11;<br>
Isa. 61:1; Luke 1:35; 4:18; John 14:16-18, 26; 15:26; 16:7-13; Acts 1:8; 5:3;<br>
10:38; Rom. 5:5; 1 Cor. 12:7-11; 2 Cor. 3:18; 2 Peter 1:21.)<br>
                                                      <br>
6. <em>Creation</em><br>
God has revealed in Scripture the authentic and historical account of<br>
His creative activity. He created the universe, and in a recent six-day<br>
creation the Lord made “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in<br>
them” and rested on the seventh day. Thus He established the Sabbath as a<br>
perpetual memorial of the work He performed and completed during six<br>
literal days that together with the Sabbath constituted the same unit of time<br>
that we call a week today. The first man and woman were made in the<br>
image of God as the crowning work of Creation, given dominion over the<br>
world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. When the world was<br>
finished it was “very good,” declaring the glory of God. (Gen. 1-2; 5; 11;<br>
Ex. 20:8-11; Ps. 19:1-6; 33:6, 9; 104; Isa. 45:12, 18; Acts 17:24; Col. 1:16;<br>
Heb. 1:2; 11:3; Rev. 10:6; 14:7.)<br>
                                                      <br>
7. <em>The Nature of Humanity</em><br>
Man and woman were made in the image of God with individuality, the<br>
power and freedom to think and to do. Though created free beings, each is<br>
an indivisible unity of body, mind, and spirit, dependent upon God for life<br>
and breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied<br>
their dependence upon Him and fell from their high position. The image of<br>
God in them was marred and they became subject to death. Their<br>
descendants share this fallen nature and its consequences. They are born<br>
with weaknesses and tendencies to evil. But God in Christ reconciled the<br>
world to Himself and by His Spirit restores in penitent mortals the image of<br>
their Maker. Created for the glory of God, they are called to love Him and<br>
one another, and to care for their environment. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:7, 15; 3;<br>
Ps. 8:4-8; 51:5, 10; 58:3; Jer. 17:9; Acts 17:24-28; Rom. 5:12-17;<br>
2 Cor. 5:19, 20; Eph. 2:3; 1 Thess. 5:23; 1 John 3:4; 4:7, 8, 11, 20.)<br>
                                                      <br>
8. <em>The Great Controversy</em><br>
All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ<br>
and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over<br>
the universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being,<br>
endowed with freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, God’s<br>
adversary, and led into rebellion a portion of the angels. He introduced the<br>
spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. This<br>
human sin resulted in the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the<br>
disordering of the created world, and its eventual devastation at the time of<br>
the global flood, as presented in the historical account of Genesis 1-11.<br>
Observed by the whole creation, this world became the arena of the<br>
universal conflict, out of which the God of love will ultimately be<br>
vindicated. To assist His people in this controversy, Christ sends the Holy<br>
Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect, and sustain them in the way of<br>
salvation. (Gen. 3; 6-8; Job 1:6-12; Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:12-18;<br>
Rom. 1:19-32; 3:4; 5:12-21; 8:19-22; 1 Cor. 4:9; Heb. 1:14; 1 Peter 5:8;<br>
2 Peter 3:6; Rev. 12:4-9.)<br>
                                                      <br>
9. <em>The Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ</em><br>
In Christ’s life of perfect obedience to God’s will, His suffering, death,<br>
and resurrection, God provided the only means of atonement for human sin,<br>
so that those who by faith accept this atonement may have eternal life, and<br>
the whole creation may better understand the infinite and holy love of the<br>
Creator. This perfect atonement vindicates the righteousness of God’s law<br>
and the graciousness of His character; for it both condemns our sin and<br>
provides for our forgiveness. The death of Christ is substitutionary and<br>
expiatory, reconciling and transforming. The bodily resurrection of Christ<br>
proclaims God’s triumph over the forces of evil, and for those who accept<br>
the atonement assures their final victory over sin and death. It declares the<br>
Lordship of Jesus Christ, before whom every knee in heaven and on earth<br>
will bow. (Gen. 3:15; Ps. 22:1; Isa. 53; John 3:16; 14:30; Rom. 1:4; 3:25;<br>
4:25; 8:3, 4; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4, 20-22; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15, 19-21; Phil. 2:6-11;<br>
Col. 2:15; 1 Peter 2:21, 22; 1 John 2:2; 4:10.)<br>
                                                      <br>
10. <em>The Experience of Salvation</em><br>
In infinite love and mercy God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin<br>
for us, so that in Him we might be made the righteousness of God. Led by<br>
the Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of<br>
our transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Saviour and Lord,<br>
Substitute and Example. This saving faith comes through the divine power<br>
of the Word and is the gift of God’s grace. Through Christ we are justified,<br>
adopted as God’s sons and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of<br>
sin. Through the Spirit we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews<br>
our minds, writes God’s law of love in our hearts, and we are given the<br>
power to live a holy life. Abiding in Him we become partakers of the divine<br>
nature and have the assurance of salvation now and in the judgment.<br>
(Gen. 3:15; Isa. 45:22; 53; Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 33:11; 36:25-27; Hab. 2:4;<br>
Mark 9:23, 24; John 3:3-8, 16; 16:8; Rom. 3:21-26; 5:6-10; 8:1-4, 14-17;<br>
10:17; 12:2; 2 Cor. 5:17-21; Gal. 1:4; 3:13, 14, 26; 4:4-7; Eph. 2:4-10;<br>
Col. 1:13, 14; Titus 3:3-7; Heb. 8:7-12; 1 Peter 1:23; 2:21, 22;<br>
2 Peter 1:3, 4; Rev. 13:8.)<br>
                                                      <br>
11. <em>Growing in Christ</em><br>
By His death on the cross Jesus triumphed over the forces of evil. He<br>
who subjugated the demonic spirits during His earthly ministry has broken<br>
their power and made certain their ultimate doom. Jesus’ victory gives us<br>
victory over the evil forces that still seek to control us, as we walk with Him<br>
in peace, joy, and assurance of His love. Now the Holy Spirit dwells within<br>
us and empowers us. Continually committed to Jesus as our Saviour and<br>
Lord, we are set free from the burden of our past deeds. No longer do we<br>
live in the darkness, fear of evil powers, ignorance, and meaninglessness of<br>
our former way of life. In this new freedom in Jesus, we are called to grow<br>
into the likeness of His character, communing with Him daily in prayer,<br>
feeding on His Word, meditating on it and on His providence, singing His<br>
praises, gathering together for worship, and participating in the mission of<br>
the Church. We are also called to follow Christ’s example by<br>
compassionately ministering to the physical, mental, social, emotional, and<br>
spiritual needs of humanity. As we give ourselves in loving service to those<br>
around us and in witnessing to His salvation, His constant presence with us<br>
through the Spirit transforms every moment and every task into a spiritual<br>
experience. (1 Chron. 29:11; Ps. 1:1, 2; 23:4; 77:11, 12; Matt. 20:25-28;<br>
25:31-46; Luke 10:17-20; John 20:21; Rom. 8:38, 39; 2 Cor. 3:17, 18;<br>
Gal. 5:22-25; Eph. 5:19, 20; 6:12-18; Phil. 3:7-14; Col. 1:13, 14;<br>
2:6, 14, 15; 1 Thess. 5:16-18, 23; Heb. 10:25; James 1:27; 2 Peter 2:9; 3:18;<br>
1 John 4:4.)<br>
                                                      <br>
12. <em>The Church</em><br>
The church is the community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as<br>
Lord and Saviour. In continuity with the people of God in Old Testament<br>
times, we are called out from the world; and we join together for worship,<br>
for fellowship, for instruction in the Word, for the celebration of the Lord’s<br>
Supper, for service to humanity, and for the worldwide proclamation of the<br>
gospel. The church derives its authority from Christ, who is the incarnate<br>
Word revealed in the Scriptures. The church is God’s family; adopted by<br>
Him as children, its members live on the basis of the new covenant. The<br>
church is the body of Christ, a community of faith of which Christ Himself<br>
is the Head. The church is the bride for whom Christ died that He might<br>
sanctify and cleanse her. At His return in triumph, He will present her to<br>
Himself a glorious church, the faithful of all the ages, the purchase of His<br>
blood, not having spot or wrinkle, but holy and without blemish.<br>
(Gen. 12:1-3; Exod. 19:3-7; Matt. 16:13-20; 18:18; 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38-42;<br>
7:38; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:22, 23; 2:19-22; 3:8-11; 5:23-27; Col. 1:17, 18;<br>
1 Peter 2:9.)<br>
                                                      <br>
13. <em>The Remnant and Its Mission</em><br>
The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but<br>
in the last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called<br>
out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This remnant<br>
announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through<br>
Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent. This proclamation is<br>
symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14; it coincides with the work<br>
of judgment in heaven and results in a work of repentance and reform on<br>
                                                      <em>FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS 167</em><br>
earth. Every believer is called to have a personal part in this worldwide<br>
witness. (Dan. 7:9-14; Isa. 1:9; 11:11; Jer. 23:3; Mic. 2:12; 2 Cor. 5:10;<br>
1 Peter 1:16-19; 4:17; 2 Peter 3:10-14; Jude 3, 14; Rev. 12:17; 14:6-12;<br>
18:1-4.)<br>
                                                      <br>
14. <em>Unity in the Body of Christ</em><br>
The church is one body with many members, called from every nation,<br>
kindred, tongue, and people. In Christ we are a new creation; distinctions of<br>
race, culture, learning, and nationality, and differences between high and<br>
low, rich and poor, male and female, must not be divisive among us. We are<br>
all equal in Christ, who by one Spirit has bonded us into one fellowship<br>
with Him and with one another; we are to serve and be served without<br>
partiality or reservation. Through the revelation of Jesus Christ in the<br>
Scriptures we share the same faith and hope, and reach out in one witness to<br>
all. This unity has its source in the oneness of the triune God, who has<br>
adopted us as His children. (Ps. 133:1; Matt. 28:19, 20; John 17:20-23;<br>
Acts 17:26, 27; Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-14; 2 Cor. 5:16, 17;<br>
Gal. 3:27-29; Eph. 2:13-16; 4:3-6, 11-16; Col. 3:10-15.)<br>
                                                      <br>
15. <em>Baptism</em><br>
By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus<br>
Christ, and testify of our death to sin and of our purpose to walk in newness<br>
of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His<br>
people, and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of<br>
our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the<br>
Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation<br>
of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in<br>
the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. (Matt. 28:19, 20;<br>
Acts 2:38; 16:30-33; 22:16; Rom. 6:1-6; Gal. 3:27; Col. 2:12, 13.)<br>
                                                      <br>
16. <em>The Lord’s Supper</em><br>
The Lord’s Supper is a participation in the emblems of the body and<br>
blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour. In<br>
this experience of communion Christ is present to meet and strengthen His<br>
people. As we partake, we joyfully proclaim the Lord’s death until He<br>
comes again. Preparation for the Supper includes self-examination,<br>
repentance, and confession. The Master ordained the service of footwashing to signify renewed cleansing, to express a willingness to serve one<br>
another in Christlike humility, and to unite our hearts in love. The<br>
communion service is open to all believing Christians. (Matt. 26:17-30;<br>
John 6:48-63; 13:1-17; 1 Cor. 10:16, 17; 11:23-30; Rev. 3:20.)<br>
                                                      <br>
17. <em>Spiritual Gifts and Ministries</em><br>
God bestows upon all members of His church in every age spiritual<br>
gifts that each member is to employ in loving ministry for the common<br>
good of the church and of humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy<br>
Spirit, who apportions to each member as He wills, the gifts provide all<br>
abilities and ministries needed by the church to fulfill its divinely ordained<br>
functions. According to the Scriptures, these gifts include such ministries as<br>
faith, healing, prophecy, proclamation, teaching, administration,<br>
reconciliation, compassion, and self-sacrificing service and charity for the<br>
help and encouragement of people. Some members are called of God and<br>
endowed by the Spirit for functions recognized by the church in pastoral,<br>
evangelistic, and teaching ministries particularly needed to equip the<br>
members for service, to build up the church to spiritual maturity, and to<br>
foster unity of the faith and knowledge of God. When members employ<br>
these spiritual gifts as faithful stewards of God’s varied grace, the church is<br>
protected from the destructive influence of false doctrine, grows with a<br>
growth that is from God, and is built up in faith and love. (Acts 6:1-7;<br>
Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:7-11, 27, 28; Eph. 4:8, 11-16; 1 Tim. 3:1-13;<br>
1 Peter 4:10, 11.)<br>
                                                      <br>
18. <em>The Gift of Prophecy</em><br>
The Scriptures testify that one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is<br>
prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and we<br>
believe it was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Her writings<br>
speak with prophetic authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction,<br>
and correction to the church. They also make clear that the Bible is the<br>
standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Num. 12:6;<br>
2 Chron. 20:20; Amos 3:7; Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17;<br>
Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 12:17; 19:10; 22:8, 9.)<br>
                                                      <br>
19. <em>The Law of God</em><br>
The great principles of God’s law are embodied in the Ten<br>
Commandments and exemplified in the life of Christ. They express God’s<br>
love, will, and purposes concerning human conduct and relationships and<br>
are binding upon all people in every age. These precepts are the basis of<br>
God’s covenant with His people and the standard in God’s judgment.<br>
Through the agency of the Holy Spirit they point out sin and awaken a<br>
sense of need for a Saviour. Salvation is all of grace and not of works, and<br>
its fruit is obedience to the Commandments. This obedience develops<br>
Christian character and results in a sense of well-being. It is an evidence of<br>
our love for the Lord and our concern for our fellow human beings. The<br>
obedience of faith demonstrates the power of Christ to transform lives, and<br>
therefore strengthens Christian witness. (Exod. 20:1-17; Deut. 28:1-14;<br>
Ps. 19:7-14; 40:7, 8; Matt. 5:17-20; 22:36-40; John 14:15; 15:7-10;<br>
Rom. 8:3, 4; Eph. 2:8-10; Heb. 8:8-10; 1 John 2:3; 5:3; Rev. 12:17; 14:12.)<br>
                                                      <br>
20. <em>The Sabbath</em><br>
The gracious Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the<br>
seventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of<br>
Creation. The fourth commandment of God’s unchangeable law requires the<br>
observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and<br>
ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the<br>
Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one<br>
another. It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of our<br>
sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our eternal future<br>
in God’s kingdom. The Sabbath is God’s perpetual sign of His eternal<br>
covenant between Him and His people. Joyful observance of this holy time<br>
from evening to evening, sunset to sunset, is a celebration of God’s creative<br>
and redemptive acts. (Gen. 2:1-3; Exod. 20:8-11; 31:13-17; Lev. 23:32;<br>
Deut. 5:12-15; Isa. 56:5, 6; 58:13, 14; Ezek. 20:12, 20; Matt. 12:1-12;<br>
Mark 1:32; Luke 4:16; Heb. 4:1-11.)<br>
                                                      <br>
21. <em>Stewardship</em><br>
We are God’s stewards, entrusted by Him with time and opportunities,<br>
abilities and possessions, and the blessings of the earth and its resources.<br>
We are responsible to Him for their proper use. We acknowledge God’s<br>
ownership by faithful service to Him and our fellow human beings, and by<br>
returning tithe and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and<br>
the support and growth of His church. Stewardship is a privilege given to us<br>
by God for nurture in love and the victory over selfishness and<br>
covetousness. Stewards rejoice in the blessings that come to others as a<br>
result of their faithfulness. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:15; 1 Chron. 29:14;<br>
Haggai 1:3-11; Mal. 3:8-12; Matt. 23:23; Rom. 15:26, 27; 1 Cor. 9:9-14;<br>
2 Cor. 8:1-15; 9:7.)<br>
                                                      <br>
22. <em>Christian Behavior</em><br>
We are called to be a godly people who think, feel, and act in harmony<br>
with biblical principles in all aspects of personal and social life. For the<br>
Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we involve ourselves only<br>
in those things that will produce Christlike purity, health, and joy in our<br>
lives. This means that our amusement and entertainment should meet the<br>
highest standards of Christian taste and beauty. While recognizing cultural<br>
differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat, befitting those<br>
whose true beauty does not consist of outward adornment but in the<br>
imperishable ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit. It also means that<br>
because our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we are to care for<br>
them intelligently. Along with adequate exercise and rest, we are to adopt<br>
the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods<br>
identified in the Scriptures. Since alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and the<br>
irresponsible use of drugs and narcotics are harmful to our bodies, we are to<br>
abstain from them as well. Instead, we are to engage in whatever brings our<br>
thoughts and bodies into the discipline of Christ, who desires our<br>
wholesomeness, joy, and goodness. (Gen. 7:2; Exod. 20:15; Lev. 11:1-47;<br>
Ps. 106:3; Rom. 12:1, 2; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 10:31; 2 Cor. 6:14-7:1; 10:5;<br>
Eph. 5:1-21; Phil. 2:4; 4:8; 1 Tim. 2:9, 10; Titus 2:11, 12; 1 Peter 3:1-4;<br>
1 John 2:6; 3 John 2.)<br>
                                                      <br>
23. <em>Marriage and the Family</em><br>
Marriage was divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be<br>
a lifelong union between a man and a woman in loving companionship. For<br>
the Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, and<br>
should be entered into only between a man and a woman who share a<br>
common faith. Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility are the fabric<br>
of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, closeness, and<br>
permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church. Regarding<br>
divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse, except for<br>
fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Although some family<br>
relationships may fall short of the ideal, a man and a woman who fully<br>
commit themselves to each other in Christ through marriage may achieve<br>
loving unity through the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the<br>
church. God blesses the family and intends that its members shall assist<br>
each other toward complete maturity. Increasing family closeness is one of<br>
the earmarks of the final gospel message. Parents are to bring up their<br>
children to love and obey the Lord. By their example and their words they<br>
are to teach them that Christ is a loving, tender, and caring guide who wants<br>
them to become members of His body, the family of God which embraces<br>
both single and married persons. (Gen. 2:18-25; Exod. 20:12; Deut. 6:5-9;<br>
Prov. 22:6; Mal. 4:5, 6; Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:3-9, 12; Mark 10:11, 12;<br>
John 2:1-11; 1 Cor. 7:7, 10, 11; 2 Cor. 6:14; Eph. 5:21-33; 6:1-4.)<br>
                                                      <br>
24. <em>Christ’s Ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary</em><br>
There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle that the Lord set up<br>
and not humans. In it Christ ministers on our behalf, making available to<br>
believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice offered once for all on the<br>
cross. At His ascension, He was inaugurated as our great High Priest and,<br>
began His intercessory ministry, which was typified by the work of the high<br>
priest in the holy place of the earthly sanctuary. In 1844, at the end of the<br>
prophetic period of 2300 days, He entered the second and last phase of His<br>
atoning ministry, which was typified by the work of the high priest in the<br>
most holy place of the earthly sanctuary. It is a work of investigative<br>
judgment which is part of the ultimate disposition of all sin, typified by the<br>
cleansing of the ancient Hebrew sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. In that<br>
typical service the sanctuary was cleansed with the blood of animal<br>
sacrifices, but the heavenly things are purified with the perfect sacrifice of<br>
the blood of Jesus. The investigative judgment reveals to heavenly<br>
intelligences who among the dead are asleep in Christ and therefore, in<br>
Him, are deemed worthy to have part in the first resurrection. It also makes<br>
manifest who among the living are abiding in Christ, keeping the<br>
commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and in Him, therefore, are<br>
ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. This judgment<br>
vindicates the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus. It<br>
declares that those who have remained loyal to God shall receive the<br>
kingdom. The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of<br>
human probation before the Second Advent. (Lev. 16; Num. 14:34;<br>
Ezek. 4:6; Dan. 7:9-27; 8:13, 14; 9:24-27; Heb. 1:3; 2:16, 17; 4:14-16;<br>
8:1-5; 9:11-28; 10:19-22; Rev. 8:3-5; 11:19; 14:6, 7, 12; 20:12; 22:11, 12.)<br>
                                                      <br>
25. <em>The Second Coming of Christ</em><br>
The second coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the<br>
grand climax of the gospel. The Saviour’s coming will be literal, personal,<br>
visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be<br>
resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be glorified and<br>
taken to heaven, but the unrighteous will die. The almost complete<br>
fulfillment of most lines of prophecy, together with the present condition of<br>
the world, indicates that Christ’s coming is near. The time of that event has<br>
not been revealed, and we are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times.<br>
(Matt. 24; Mark 13; Luke 21; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Cor. 15:51-54;<br>
1 Thess. 4:13-18; 5:1-6; 2 Thess. 1:7-10; 2:8; 2 Tim. 3:1-5; Titus 2:13;<br>
Heb. 9:28; Rev. 1:7; 14:14-20; 19:11-21.)<br>
                                                      <br>
26. <em>Death and Resurrection</em><br>
The wages of sin is death. But God, who alone is immortal, will grant<br>
eternal life to His redeemed. Until that day death is an unconscious state for<br>
all people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected righteous<br>
and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up to meet their Lord.<br>
The second resurrection, the resurrection of the unrighteous, will take place<br>
a thousand years later. (Job 19:25-27; Ps. 146:3, 4; Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10;<br>
Dan. 12:2, 13; Isa. 25:8; John 5:28, 29; 11:11-14; Rom. 6:23;<br>
1 Cor. 15:51-54; Col. 3:4; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Rev. 20:1-10.)<br>
                                                      <br>
27. <em>The Millennium and the End of Sin</em><br>
The millennium is the thousand-year reign of Christ with His saints in<br>
heaven between the first and second resurrections. During this time the<br>
wicked dead will be judged; the earth will be utterly desolate, without living<br>
human inhabitants, but occupied by Satan and his angels. At its close Christ<br>
with His saints and the Holy City will descend from heaven to earth. The<br>
unrighteous dead will then be resurrected, and with Satan and his angels<br>
will surround the city; but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the<br>
earth. The universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever.<br>
(Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:18, 19; Mal. 4:1; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Rev. 20; 21:1-5.)<br>
                                                      <br>
28. <em>The New Earth</em><br>
On the new earth, in which righteousness dwells, God will provide<br>
an eternal home for the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting<br>
life, love, joy, and learning in His presence. For here God Himself will<br>
dwell with His people, and suffering and death will have passed away. The<br>
great controversy will be ended, and sin will be no more. All things,<br>
animate and inanimate, will declare that God is love; and He shall reign<br>
forever. Amen. (Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; 2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 11:15;<br>
21:1-7; 22:1-5.)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      <strong>Notes<br>
                                                      </strong><br>
These notes contain explanatory material regarding how a church may<br>
proceed in a particular matter. A church may adopt alternative ways of<br>
handling such items. Such alternative methods should be in harmony with generally accepted principles of Church organization and operation.<br>

                                                   <span style="color:#2F5496;"><br>

pastor must be legally appointed and registered in order to conduct the<br>
marriage service. In many lands the pastor may perform the ceremony in the church, but the marriage contract is legally signed by the district registrar, who usually sits in the vestry and listens to the approved form of marriage declaration. In still other lands the pastor cannot perform the ceremony at all because it is recognized as a state responsibility and is looked upon as a<br>
civil contract. In such cases members usually retire to the home or place of<br>
worship, where a pastor conducts a special service to seek the blessing of<br>
the Lord upon the couple. (See pp. 153-160.)<br>
                                                      <br>
2. <strong><em>Training and Equipping of Elders </em></strong>(see p. 76)—While the pastor<br>
has the primary responsibility for training elders, conferences are<br>
encouraged to schedule periodic meetings for their training. In order to<br>
support a pastor-elder team relationship, pastors also should attend the<br>
training meetings. Leaders of companies who function in the place of elders<br>
also should be invited.<br>
                                                      <br>
3. <strong><em>Training and Equipping of Deacons and Deaconesses </em></strong>(see<br>
pp. 77 and 80)—While the pastor has the primary responsibility for the<br>
training of deacons and deaconesses, the Ministerial Association of the<br>
conference is encouraged to schedule periodic meetings for the training of<br>
the deacons and deaconesses.<br>
                                                      <br>
4. <strong><em>Care and Maintenance of Church Property </em></strong>(see pp. 79, 81)—<br>
Deacons and deaconesses must see that the church building is kept clean<br>
and in repair and that the grounds are kept clean and attractive. This also<br>
includes ensuring that janitorial work is done. In large churches where it is<br>
necessary to employ a janitor, the deacons should recommend a suitable<br>
person to the board, which votes to employ such help, or the board may<br>
authorize the deacons to employ a janitor. Board authorization should be<br>
obtained for all major repair expenses. All bills for repairs, as well as for<br>
recurring expenses, such as water, electricity, and, fuel, are referred to the<br>
treasurer for payment.<br>
                                                      <br>
5. <strong><em>Clerk Keeps Records </em></strong>(see p. 81)—Board minutes should be<br>
recorded in the church record book, or in another appropriate record system<br>
adopted by the church, giving the time and date of meeting, number<br>
attending, and a report of all actions taken. The clerk should also make a list<br>
of committees appointed at the meeting, giving to the chairperson a list of<br>
the members of each committee, together with its terms of reference and an<br>
outline of work it is asked to do. The church record book may be secured<br>
from the Adventist Book Center or, in some countries, from the publishing<br>
house.<br>
The church record book contains a place for recording membership,<br>
including columns showing how and when members are received or<br>
removed. This record must be kept chronologically, and supporting data for<br>
each entry also should be recorded in the section where minutes of<br>
membership actions are kept. The membership record must be accurately<br>
and currently maintained in order to show the official standing of the<br>
membership.<br>
                                                      <br>
6. <strong><em>Corresponding With Members </em></strong>(see p. 82)—The clerk should<br>
correspond frequently with absent members and should pass on to them<br>
news of church progress, encouraging them, in turn, to report their Christian<br>
activities each quarter.<br>
                                                      <br>
7. <strong><em>Money for Personal Literature Orders </em></strong>(see p. 84)—Where a<br>
local Adventist Book Center does not exist, members may place money for<br>
personal orders of literature, books, pamphlets, magazines, and<br>
subscriptions for periodicals in an envelope, with the order form properly<br>
filled out, and hand it to the personal ministries secretary. The treasurer then<br>
remits both order and payment for all such literature to the Adventist Book<br>
Center or to the publishing house, according to the system adopted by the<br>
conference. At the close of each quarter the personal ministries secretary<br>
will report to the church, at its quarterly business meeting, about the<br>
standing of its account with the Adventist Book Center and/or publishing<br>
house and shall provide a copy for the treasurer. (See p. 101.)<br>
                                                      <br>
8. <strong><em>Safeguarding Children</em></strong>—Church should be a safe place to bring<br>
our children. Everyone involved with children who are minors must meet<br>
                                                      <em>NOTES 175</em><br>
all Church and legal standards and requirements. In order to safeguard our<br>
children, churches are encouraged to adopt policies that would provide a<br>
measure of safety and protection for children. Such policies should include<br>
the following:<br>
a. <em>Two-Adult Policy</em>—Have two adults present in children’s<br>
classrooms or activities.<br>
b. <em>Open Door</em>—Discourage private or one-on-one contact and<br>
encourage an open-door policy in all situations. Where an open door is not<br>
possible, station a second adult at the door.<br>
c. <em>Volunteer Screening</em>—Have all volunteers complete a<br>
volunteer information form, check their references, and, if required by law,<br>
do a police background check.<br>
d. <em>Six-Month Policy</em>—Require a waiting period of six months for<br>
newly baptized or transferring members who have indicated a willingness to<br>
work with children.<br>
e. <em>Training</em>—Provide regular training for teachers and volunteers<br>
to help them understand and protect children and how to nurture their faith.<br>
Local church leaders should consult with the conference in order to<br>
ascertain conference procedures and requirements, including local legal<br>
requirements for individuals working with children.<br>

15. <strong><em>Adventist Community Services </em></strong>(see pp. 101 and 102)—Some<br>
territories continue to have an active Dorcas Society and Adventist Men, or<br>
have alternate names for social ministry out of the local church that have<br>
been officially approved by regional church administrative units. In such<br>
cases, the church should elect an Adventist Community Services<br>
coordinator (not a director) to coordinate all community services conducted<br>
by the local church departments, services, and deacons/deaconesses, which<br>
have their individual leaders.<br>
Leaders of Dorcas, Adventist Men, other officially approved local<br>
church social ministries organizations, and Adventist Community Services<br>
coordinators at the local level participate as members of the Personal<br>
Ministries Council under the umbrella of the Personal Ministries<br>
Department as stated in this Church Manual.<br>
When community services work is newly organized in a territory, it is<br>
recommended to follow the Adventist Community Services model, which<br>
involves all church members, in a wide array of community services based<br>
on identified needs. For more information go to<br>
www.sabbathschoolpersonalministries.org and click on the Adventist<br>

organizational plan is available from the conference youth ministries<br>

resources, personnel, facilities, and school relationships, developing the best<br>
youth ministry in keeping with these factors.<br>
Different terms such as “club,” “society,” “fellowship,” or “action,”<br>
may be selected, but the name “Adventist Youth” should always be used to<br>
clearly identify the organization.<br>

prevent a conference from adopting a longer or shorter period, though it is important to have sufficient time to regularly promote the missionary<br>
activities and responsibilities of the world church, along with the mission<br>
offering, plus at least thirty minutes for Bible study.<br>

3. <strong><em>Form of Service </em></strong>(see p. 122)—As the participants enter and kneel,<br>
the congregation should, with bowed heads, implore the presence and<br>
blessing of God. A worshipful hush prepares the way for the exercises that follow.<br>
                                                      <br>

a. The congregational response in praise and adoration,<br>
expressed in song, prayer, and gifts.<br>
b. The message from the Word of God.<br>
The one leading the worshipers into the presence of God with the<br>
pastoral prayer should do so with a sense of awe, realizing its importance.<br>
Customarily the person praying kneels facing the congregation, and the<br>
congregation, as far as practicable kneeling, in turn faces the individual<br>
praying. The prayer should be brief but should include adoration, thanks,<br>
and mention of the personal needs of worshippers, as well as of the world<br>
field.<br>
The offering is a vital part of the worship hour. While we are counseled<br>
to “worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,” we are also exhorted to<br>
“bring an offering, and come into His courts” (Ps. 96:9, 8). So the<br>
presentation of our gifts to God quite naturally finds its place as a part of the<br>
worship service.<br>
Special music or a devotional hymn is appropriate.<br>
Then comes what should be one of the most important parts of the<br>
worship hour—the spiritual feeding of the flock of God. Blessed results to<br>
the glory of God always follow when a congregation is truly fed and feels<br>
that “God has visited His people” (Luke 7:16). The one who brings the<br>
message should fully sense the sacredness of this work and should be<br>
thoroughly prepared.<br>
The elder collaborates with the church pastor in planning the order of<br>
the service. If the church has no regular pastor, the elder is in charge of the<br>
service and should either conduct it or arrange for someone to do so. From<br>
time to time a meeting for testimony and praise may be conducted, or the<br>
time may be given to certain members to relate their experiences in outreach<br>
(missionary) work.<br>
                                                      <br>
4. <strong><em>Times of Meetings </em></strong>(see p. 122)—In order to strengthen and<br>
develop the outreach (missionary) spirit among our members, auxiliary<br>
personal ministries meetings might be conducted in one or more of the<br>
following ways: a. The ten-minute weekly personal ministries meeting held<br>
each Sabbath, usually following the close of the Sabbath School and<br>
preceding the preaching service.<br>
b. A midweek meeting combined with the weekly prayer<br>
meeting. On this occasion, the first part of the service may be given to a<br>
devotional message, followed by a season of prayer, remembering that<br>
worship is vital in spiritual growth and preparation for service. The<br>
remainder of the time may be devoted to training for lay evangelistic<br>
service. Instruction in soul-winning methods is presented, and the members<br>
are given opportunity to present and discuss problems they have met in lay<br>
evangelism.<br>
Personal ministries meetings should meet at times suited to local<br>
conditions. The personal ministries council should carefully plan to make<br>
the personal ministries services of the church occasions for spiritual revival<br>
and practical training, and see that they are conducted with the same<br>
regularity and continuity as other meetings of the church.<br>
                                                      <br>
5. <strong><em>Foot-Washing </em></strong>(see p. 123)—Men and women should be provided<br>
separate areas for foot-washing. Where stairs or distance is a problem,<br>
special arrangements should be made for those with disabilities. In places<br>
where it is socially acceptable and where clothing is such that there would<br>
be no immodesty, separate arrangements may be made for husband and<br>
wife or parents and baptized children to share with each other in the footwashing ceremony. To encourage shy or sensitive people who may view the<br>
selecting of a foot-washing partner as an embarrassing experience, church<br>
leaders should be designated to help such persons find partners.<br>
All should thoroughly wash their hands before returning to participate<br>
in the Lord’s Supper. Those leading out in the service should do this<br>
publicly for hygienic purposes.<br>
                                                      <br>
6. <strong><em>Bread and Wine </em></strong>(see p. 124)—A hymn may be sung during the<br>
reassembly of the congregation as the officiating pastors or elders take their<br>
places near the bread and wine (unfermented grape juice) and the deacons<br>
and deaconesses take their places.<br>
The covering over the bread is removed.<br>
A suitable passage of Scripture may be read, such as<br>
1 Corinthians 11:23, 24; Matthew 26:26; Mark 14:22; or Luke 22:19; or a<br>
brief sermon may be given at this point in the service rather than earlier.<br>
This can be especially effective if the sermon emphasizes the meaning of<br>
the bread and wine so its message is still fresh in the minds of participants<br>
as the emblems are being distributed.<br>
Those officiating normally kneel while the blessing is asked on the<br>
bread. The congregation may kneel or remain seated.<br>
Usually most of the bread to be served is broken ahead of time, with a<br>
small portion left on each plate for the elders and/or pastors to break. (All<br>
handling the bread must wash their hands thoroughly before returning for<br>
the communion service.) The pastors and elders hand the plates containing<br>
the bread to the deacons, who then serve the congregation, though in small<br>
congregations the pastor or elders may serve all participants.<br>
During this time there may be a choice of special music, testimonies, a<br>
summary of the sermon, selected readings, congregational singing, or<br>
meditative music.<br>
Participants should retain their portions of the bread until the officiating<br>
pastors or elders have been served. When everyone has been seated, the<br>
leader invites all to partake of the bread together. Silent prayers are offered<br>
as the bread is eaten.<br>
The pastor then reads a suitable passage, such as<br>
1 Corinthians 11:25, 26; Matthew 26:27-29; Mark 14:23-25; or Luke 22:20.<br>
Leaders kneel as the prayer is given over the wine. Again, deacons serve the<br>
congregation. Activities such as those suggested during the passing of the<br>
bread may be continued at this time. After the officiating pastors or elders<br>
have been served, all worshippers partake of the wine together.<br>
An optional method is for the bread to be blessed and broken; then the<br>
bread and wine are placed on the same tray and passed to the congregation.<br>
The worshipper takes both from the tray at the same time. The bread is<br>
eaten, followed by silent prayer. Then after prayer over the wine, it is taken,<br>
followed by silent prayer. Where pews or seats are equipped with racks to<br>
hold the wine glasses, the collection of glasses is unnecessary until after the<br>
service.<br>
                                                      <br>
7. <strong><em>Business Meetings </em></strong>(see p. 128)—Reports may comprise the<br>
following activities:<br>
a. A report from the clerk showing the present membership of<br>
the church and the number of members received and those transferred to<br>
other churches. Note also should be made, giving the number but not<br>
necessarily the names of those who were removed from fellowship during<br>
the year, as well as those who have died. A brief statement of the decisions<br>
of the church board in its meetings may interest members.<br>
b. A report from the personal ministries leader giving a statement<br>
of outreach (missionary) activities, including Community Services<br>
activities, together with plans for future work. This should be followed by a<br>
report from the personal ministries secretary.<br>
c. A report from the treasurer showing the amount of tithe<br>
received and sent to the conference, a statement of mission offerings<br>
received and forwarded, and a statement showing local church funds<br>
received and disbursed.<br>
d. A report from the deacons and deaconesses concerning visits<br>
to members, their activities in behalf of the poor, and their other nurturing<br>
work.<br>
e. A report from the secretary of the young people’s society<br>
outlining the activities in outreach (missionary) and other lines by the youth<br>
of the church.<br>
f. A report from the Sabbath School secretary giving the<br>
membership and other matters pertaining to the Sabbath School.<br>
g. A report from the treasurer about the financial status of the<br>
church school, with details as to its needs in equipment and other matters.<br>
h. A report from the principal or teacher of the church school<br>
covering such matters as enrollment, the educational progress of the school,<br>
baptisms among the schoolchildren, and the results of the children’s efforts<br>
in denominational endeavors.<br>
i. A report from the Home and School Association leader<br>
covering the activities and needs of that organization.<br>
j. A report from the communication secretary covering press,<br>
radio, television, and other communication activities involving church and<br>
com- munity.<br>
                                                      <br>
8. <strong><em>Other Committees of the Board </em></strong>(see p. 132)—Leaders of other board-appointed committees should periodically report. For example, in a large church, the board may appoint a committee for evangelistic planning composed of the heads of the church outreach departments, with an elder as chairperson. This committee will report to the board and will also assume the task of department coordination of outreach programs.<br>
                                                      <br>
9. <strong><em>Adventist Youth Ministries Resources </em></strong>(see pp. 133, 134)<br>
Resource materials to help Adventist Youth Ministries leadership are available from the division, union, and conference youth ministries departments. Included in these resource materials is <em>Youth Ministry Accent</em>, a quarterly journal published by the General Conference Youth Ministries Department. Available leaflets covering a broad spectrum of topics to help in youth ministry may be secured from the conference youth ministries department and the Adventist Book Center.<br>
