<h2>Lesson 44 - Living the New Life</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>1. The Fellowship of the New Birth</h3>
<p><strong>a. What is Christian experience?</strong> 
    <br> Christian experience is described in <em>1 John 1:3</em>, where it says, "That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ." Additionally, <em>Isaiah 57:15</em> states, "For thus says the High and Lofty One Who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: 'I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who has a contrite and humble spirit.'"
</p>
<p><strong>b. How closely does Christ identify Himself with us?</strong> 
    <br> In <em>John 17:23</em>, Jesus prays, "I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me." Christ identifies Himself with us to such a degree that His love for us is as profound as the love the Father has for Him.
</p>
<p><strong>c. How does He dwell in us?</strong>
    <br> In <em>Ephesians 3:17</em>, we are told, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love," and in <em>John 14:17</em>, "the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you."
</p>
<p><strong>d. What comes to the person who cultivates this fellowship?</strong>
    <br> According to <em>1 John 1:4</em>, "And these things we write to you that your joy may be full." Furthermore, in <em>John 15:11</em>, Jesus says, "These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full."
</p>
<p><strong>e. What promise is made to the Christian?</strong> 
    <br> In <em>Matthew 28:20</em>, Jesus promises, "And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Additionally, in <em>John 14:16-17</em>, He assures, "And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever—the Spirit of truth."
</p>
<p><strong>“That regenerating power, which no human eye can see, begets a new life in the soul; it creates a new being in the image of God.”</strong> (SC 57)

</p>

<h3>2. Growing in Fellowship</h3>
<p><strong>a. How is Christian experience to be regarded?</strong> 
    <br> In <em>Mark 4:26-28</em>, it is likened to a seed growing, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground, and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how." Also, <em>Ephesians 4:15</em> teaches, "But, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ."
</p>
<p><strong>b. To what extent are we to love our neighbor?</strong>
    <br> In <em>Matthew 22:39</em>, Jesus commands, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
</p>

<h3>3. The Word and Growth</h3>
<p><strong>a. How is the Word to be esteemed?</strong>
    <br> Job 23:12 states, "I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food." Similarly, <em>1 Peter 2:2</em> advises, "As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby."
</p>
<p><strong>b. How does the Word affect the life?</strong>
    <br> <em>Psalm 119:9</em> teaches, "How can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your word." And in <em>Psalm 19:7</em>, it is written, "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul."
</p>
<p><strong>c. What gives stability to character?</strong>
    <br> <em>Psalm 37:31</em> states, "The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide." And in <em>Job 1:8</em>, the Lord says, "Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?"
</p>
<p><strong>“The works of holiness, which appeared wearisome, are now his delight. The word of God, which was dull and uninteresting, is now chosen as his study, the man of his counsel. It is as a letter written to him from God, bearing the inscription of the Eternal.”</strong> (2T 294, 295)

</p>

<h3>4. Prayer and Growth</h3>
<p><strong>a. What is the place of prayer in Christian experience?</strong>
    <br> In <em>Luke 18:1</em>, Jesus said, "Then He spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray and not lose heart." And in <em>Luke 21:36</em>, "Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass."
</p>
<p><strong>b. What is prayer and what does it do for us?</strong>
    <br> Prayer is described in <em>Jeremiah 29:12-14</em>, "Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart." In <em>John 14:13-14</em>, Jesus assures, "And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
</p>
<p><strong>“Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that it is necessary in order to make known to God what we are, but in order to enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings us up to Him.”</strong> (SC 93)
</p>

<h3>5. Service and Growth</h3>
<p><strong>a. To what are Christians called?</strong> 
    <br> Christians are called to serve, as shown in <em>Isaiah 61:1-2</em>, "The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon Me, because the LORD has anointed Me to preach good tidings to the poor." And in <em>2 Corinthians 5:20</em>, "Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us."
</p>
<p><strong>b. What impels us to service?</strong>
    <br> In <em>2 Corinthians 5:14</em>, "For the love of Christ compels us."
</p>
<p><strong>c. In whose power do we serve?</strong>
    <br> In <em>Philippians 4:13</em>, it says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
</p>
<p><strong>d. What promise is made to those in service?</strong>
    <br> In <em>Psalm 126:6</em>, "He who continually goes forth weeping, bearing seed for sowing, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him." Also in <em>Proverbs 11:30</em>, "The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise."
</p>
<p><strong>“Every one who accepts Christ as his personal Savior will long for the privilege of serving God. Contemplating what Heaven has done for him, his heart is moved with boundless love and adoring gratitude.”</strong> (GW 294)
</p>

Lesson 44 – Living the New Life

1. The Fellowship of the New Birth
Christian experience is beautifully explained in 1 John 1:3. It says, “That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.” This is echoed in Isaiah 57:15, where God declares that He dwells with those who have a humble and contrite spirit.

Christ identifies with us deeply. In John 17:23, He prays, “I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in one.” He wants the world to know that the Father loves us just as He loves His Son.

Christ dwells in us through faith, as stated in Ephesians 3:17. It says, “That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, being rooted and grounded in love.” John 14:17 also explains that the Spirit of truth dwells with us and will be in us.

When we cultivate this fellowship, joy fills our lives. In 1 John 1:4 and John 15:11, we are reminded that these things were written and spoken so that our joy may be full.

To Christians, Jesus makes a powerful promise in Matthew 28:20: “Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” And in John 14:16–17, He promises the Holy Spirit, who will be with us forever.

A powerful statement captures this transformation: “That regenerating power, which no human eye can see, begets a new life in the soul; it creates a new being in the image of God.” (Steps to Christ, page 57)

2. Growing in Fellowship
Christian experience is something that grows. In Mark 4:26–28, it is compared to a seed that sprouts and grows in ways we may not fully understand. Ephesians 4:15 encourages us to grow in every way into Christ, who is the head.

Loving our neighbor is essential. In Matthew 22:39, Jesus says, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” This kind of love reflects the true spirit of Christian growth.


---

3. The Word and Growth
The Word of God is to be treasured above even our daily food. Job 23:12 says, “I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.” And 1 Peter 2:2 urges us to long for the pure milk of the Word so we may grow.

God’s Word transforms our lives. Psalm 119:9 asks, “How can a young man cleanse his way?” The answer: “By taking heed according to Your word.” Psalm 19:7 adds, “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.”

The Word also brings stability to our character. Psalm 37:31 reminds us that when God's law is in our hearts, our steps will not slide. Job 1:8 speaks of Job as a blameless and upright man who fears God and avoids evil.

As one inspired writer put it, “The works of holiness, which appeared wearisome, are now his delight. The Word of God, once dull and uninteresting, becomes a personal message from God.” (Testimonies, Volume 2, pages 294–295)


---

4. Prayer and Growth
Prayer is vital in Christian life. In Luke 18:1, Jesus taught that we should always pray and not give up. Luke 21:36 also urges us to stay alert and pray always.

Prayer is more than just talking to God. In Jeremiah 29:12–14, God says, “Call upon Me, and pray to Me, and I will listen to you… You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.” Jesus echoes this in John 14:13–14, promising to do whatever we ask in His name.

“Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend,” says Steps to Christ, page 93. “Not to tell Him what He does not know, but to bring us into His presence. Prayer lifts us up to God.”


---

5. Service and Growth
Christians are called to serve. Isaiah 61:1–2 speaks of being anointed to preach good news to the poor. 2 Corinthians 5:20 calls us “ambassadors for Christ,” with God pleading through us.

The love of Christ is what compels us to serve, according to 2 Corinthians 5:14. And Philippians 4:13 reminds us, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”

God promises a reward for faithful service. Psalm 126:6 speaks of the one who goes out sowing in tears, returning with joy and a harvest. Proverbs 11:30 tells us, “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise.”

Finally, consider this thought: “Everyone who accepts Christ longs to serve Him. Reflecting on what Heaven has done for them, their hearts overflow with love and gratitude.” (Gospel Workers, page 294)

Lesson 45 – The New Life of Victory


Let’s begin with the theme: The Spirit-Filled Life. A Spirit-filled and sanctified life is one that is fully led by the Holy Spirit. This means total surrender to God—our minds, bodies, and souls are given completely to Him. Romans 8:5 and 9 says, “For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit... Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” This shows us clearly that a life set apart for God is directed by His Spirit and not by our selfish desires. As the book Great Controversy, page 473, reminds us, “The sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire being—spirit, soul, and body… Christians are bidden to present their bodies ‘a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.’”

Now, let us talk about The Struggles of a New Life. When we begin our journey with Christ, struggles come. Ephesians 6:11 says we must “put on the whole armour of God” so that we can stand firm against the devil’s tricks. Trials are not to discourage us but to strengthen us. In 1 Peter 4:12-13, we are told not to be surprised by these fiery trials, but to rejoice, because we are sharing in Christ’s sufferings. Trials are tools in God’s hands. As Mount of Blessing, page 10, puts it: “The trials of life are God’s workmen to remove the impurities and roughness from our character.” And Acts of the Apostles, page 524, adds: “Trials and obstacles are His chosen methods of discipline, and His appointed conditions of success.”

When temptations come, James 4:7-8 instructs us to submit to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from us. We also find power through Christ. First Corinthians 15:57 declares, “Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” And First John 5:4-5 tells us that whoever is born of God overcomes the world through faith in Jesus.

What if we sin? God has made provision. First John 2:1-2 tells us that we have an Advocate—Jesus Christ. Psalm 37:24 reassures us that even if we fall, we will not be completely cast down, because the Lord holds us with His hand. Colossians 2:6 urges us to continue walking in Christ just as we received Him.

Paul’s principle in Acts 24:16 was to always maintain a clear conscience before both God and man. And the principle for a powerful Christian life? It’s in Matthew 7:12: “Whatever you want others to do for you, do the same for them.” Education, page 136, sums it up: “The whole circle of our obligation to one another is covered by that word of Christ’s.”

Next, let’s explore Victory Through the Practice of Prayer. Prayer is essential in the life of victory. First Thessalonians 5:17 says, “Pray without ceasing.” In Luke 11:1, the disciples asked, “Lord, teach us to pray.” Prayer is not just a habit—it is heaven’s ordained means of success. Acts of the Apostles, page 564, calls it the secret weapon in our battle with sin. Gospel Workers, page 254 and 255, describes prayer as “the breath of the soul... the secret of spiritual power.”

When should we pray? Psalm 55:17 says, “Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray.” Psalm 5:3 also speaks of morning prayer, and Luke 18:1 reminds us that we ought always to pray and never give up.

Can we pray anywhere? Yes! First Timothy 2:8 says, “I will therefore that men pray everywhere.” And Matthew 6:6 speaks of going into our closet to pray in secret.

What can we pray about? Philippians 4:6 says, “In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.” Nothing is too big or too small. Steps to Christ, page 100, encourages us to bring every joy, sorrow, and need to God.

What about group prayer? Matthew 18:19-20 tells us that if two or three gather in agreement, Jesus is there with them. Hebrews 10:25 tells us not to neglect meeting together.

There are also conditions that affect prayer. These include:

Belief, as shown in James 1:6-8 and Hebrews 11:6
Humility and repentance, seen in Psalm 34:18 and Proverbs 16:5
Hatred for sin, according to Psalm 66:18 and James 4:3
A forgiving spirit, based on Matthew 6:14-15 and Mark 11:25
Asking in Jesus’ name, from John 14:13-14 and 15:16
Obedience, as 1 John 3:22 and Proverbs 28:9 teach
Confession, shown in James 5:16 and Matthew 5:23-24
Kindness, reflected in Ephesians 4:32 and Romans 12:10
Honesty with God, found in Malachi 3:7-8, Psalm 66:13-14, and Ecclesiastes 5:4-5
Persistence in prayer, according to Ephesians 6:18, 1 Thessalonians 5:17, and Luke 18:4-5
And praying according to His will, as seen in 1 John 5:14.
Finally, who helps us pray? Romans 8:26 tells us that the Holy Spirit Himself helps us. He intercedes with groanings too deep for words.
