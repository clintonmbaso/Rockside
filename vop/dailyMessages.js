        <blockquote>
            “But he said to them, ‘Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:6">Mark 16:6</span></strong>, NKJV).
        </blockquote>
        <p>The crucifixion of Jesus destroyed the hopes and faith of His disciples. It was a dark weekend for them as they not only grappled with their Master’s death but feared for their own lives, as well (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:19">John 20:19</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>In <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong>, the final chapter in this Gospel, we will look at what followed His death.</p>
        <p>First, we will examine the timing of Jesus’ resurrection and why the women came to the tomb on that Sunday morning. Adventists have sometimes shied away from resurrection morning because of the way it is misused to support Sunday sacredness. We will instead see how we can rejoice in the Sunday resurrection, despite the false theology that has, unfortunately, arisen from it.</p>
        <p>Second, the lesson explains the first verses of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong>, linking these words to a theme that runs through the entire book. Our studies on Monday and Tuesday will look at these concepts.</p>
        <p>Third, Wednesday and Thursday will examine the rest of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong> and consider the mission it sets before us. This study will close with a challenge to the reader of Mark to take the gospel throughout the world.</p>

    title: "Rejoicing in the Resurrection",
    text: `
        <p>All the Gospel writers agree that Jesus died on the day that they identify as the “preparation” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 27:62">Matthew 27:62</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 15:42">Mark 15:42</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 23:54">Luke 23:54</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:14, 31, 42">John 19:14, 31, 42</span></strong>). Most commentators understand this as a reference to sunset Thursday through sunset Friday. Jesus died late on Friday afternoon and was then quickly buried before sunset.</p>
        <p>During the Sabbath, the Lord rested in the grave, and all of Jesus’ disciples rested as well. “And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 23:56">Luke 23:56</span></strong>, NKJV), a rather strange action if, in fact, Jesus had lessened, at least in their minds, the obligation to keep the fourth commandment.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, the women bought spices, and on Sunday morning, they went to the tomb with the desire to complete the typical burial process. Of course, Jesus was not there!</p>
        <p>As early as the second century, Christians saw significance in the fact that Jesus rose on Sunday. This became the basis for Sunday sacredness. But is that what the New Testament teaches?</p>
        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Colossians 2:10-12">Colossians 2:10-12</span></strong>. What is the New Testament memorial of Jesus’ resurrection?</p>
        <p>Not a word in the Bible hints at Sunday sacredness as a memorial of the Resurrection. That memorial is baptism. “Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 6:4">Romans 6:4</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>
        <p>Regardless of the false theology regarding Sunday worship, as Adventists we must rejoice in the Sunday morning resurrection of Jesus. Jesus has triumphed over death, and in His resurrection, we have the surety of ours.</p>
        <p>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Peter 1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span></strong>, NKJV). Look at the certainty Paul had about the resurrection of Jesus. How can we have that certainty, as well?</p>

    title: "The Stone Was Rolled Away",
    text: `
        <p>The story of the resurrection appears in each of the Gospels. Each Gospel writer presents the story from a different perspective, but they all contain the core concepts that appear also in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 15:1-8">1 Corinthians 15:1-8</span></strong>.</p>
        <p>Four ideas appear again and again—died, buried, risen, seen. In Mark, “died” and “buried” are in chapter 15. The “risen” and “seen” appear in chapter 16, but with a twist. <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:7">Mark 16:7</span></strong> speaks of a meeting in Galilee, and there you will see Him (see <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 21">John 21</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>Some people find it incredible that Christians believe in a risen Lord. But the evidence for His resurrection is substantial and consistent with reason.</p>
        <p>For starters, all one has to do is believe in God as the Creator (see <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span></strong>) and the idea of the resurrection, of a miracle, becomes reasonable. The God who created the universe, and then life on earth, certainly had the power, if He chose, to resurrect Jesus. The existence of God doesn’t make the resurrection of Jesus inevitable, only reasonable.</p>
        <p>Next, the tomb was definitely empty. Even atheist historians accept that fact. If it were not, the claim about His resurrection would fail right from the start because the existence of His body there would destroy any claims of His having risen.</p>
        <p>Next, the explanation that His disciples stole the body does not work. The disciples surely couldn’t have gotten past the guards. And even if they had done so and got the body, why were the disciples never arrested for stealing it? The answer is that the religious leaders knew that the disciples had not done it.</p>
        <p>Also, numerous people testified that they saw the risen Christ. Many, including the disciples, did not at first believe. And one very solid enemy, Paul, not only claims to have seen the risen Lord but that this experience changed the whole trajectory of his life—in very radical ways, too.</p>
        <p>Finally (though there are many other reasons), how does one explain the rise of the Christian church, founded by people who claimed to have seen the risen Lord? Why would these people have been willing to die for what they knew was a lie? Their consistent testimony, both right after His death (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 3:15">Acts 3:15</span></strong>) and years later (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Peter 1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span></strong>), provides powerful evidence for His resurrection.</p>
        <p>If someone were to ask you, What evidence do you have for Christ’s resurrection, what would you say?</p>

    title: "The Women at the Tomb",
    text: `
        <p>“The women who had stood by the cross of Christ waited and watched for the hours of the Sabbath to pass. On the first day of the week, very early, they made their way to the tomb, taking with them precious spices to anoint the Saviour’s body. They did not think about His rising from the dead. The sun of their hope had set, and night had settled down on their hearts. As they walked, they recounted Christ's works of mercy and His words of comfort. But they remembered not His words, ‘I will see you again.’” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 16:22">John 16:22</span></strong>) — Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 788.</p>
        <p><strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:1-8">Mark 16:1-8</span></strong> recounts that the women came to the tomb to anoint Jesus’ body. They found the stone rolled away and were told by an angel that Jesus had risen. At first, they were frightened and fled, telling no one of what they had seen.</p>
        <p>From the beginning of Mark’s Gospel, the reader knows that Jesus is the Messiah. However, the first non-demon-possessed person to proclaim Him the Messiah is Peter in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 8:29">Mark 8:29</span></strong>, which happens halfway through the book.</p>
        <p>Throughout Mark, Jesus tells people to keep quiet about His identity and miracles. He tells a leper to stay silent in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 1:44">Mark 1:44</span></strong>, Jairus and his wife after their daughter's resurrection in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 5:43">Mark 5:43</span></strong>, and those present at the healing of the deaf and mute man in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 7:36">Mark 7:36</span></strong>. He even commands His disciples not to reveal He is the Messiah (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 8:30">Mark 8:30</span></strong>; see also <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 9:9">Mark 9:9</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>The reason for this was likely to ensure that Jesus completed His ministry according to the time prophecies in Daniel 9:24-27. But after the Resurrection, even though the women were initially afraid to speak, their silence did not last long.</p>
        <p>By the end of Mark’s Gospel, we read, “And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:20">Mark 16:20</span></strong>, ESV).</p>
        <p>The motif of silence about Jesus is shattered. The book concludes with the disciples spreading the good news of His resurrection and what He has done.</p>
        <p>Why must we not keep silent about Jesus and what He has done? Who can you tell today about Jesus and the plan of salvation?</p>

    title: "Appearing to Mary and Others",
    text: `
        <p>Almost all of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:9-20">Mark 16:9-20</span></strong> has parallels to other passages in the New Testament—Mary Magdalene at the tomb seeing Jesus (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:1, 9, 10">Matthew 28:1, 9, 10</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span></strong>; compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 8:2">Luke 8:2</span></strong>); two disciples see Him in the countryside (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 24:13-35">Luke 24:13-35</span></strong>); the 11 disciples are commissioned (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:16-20">Matthew 28:16-20</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 24:36-49">Luke 24:36-49</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:19-23">John 20:19-23</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>The first person to see Jesus alive was Mary Magdalene (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span></strong>). Other women saw Him as well (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:8-10">Matthew 28:8-10</span></strong>). It is significant that the first people to see the risen Lord were women. In the ancient world, women did not have high status as witnesses. If the story were fabricated, it would have been much more likely to name men as the first witnesses. But it is not men, not the 11, but a woman who first sees Jesus. She goes to tell the good news to the disciples, but, not surprisingly, they do not believe her testimony, most likely because it seemed fantastic and also, unfortunately, because Mary was a woman.</p>
        <p>Apologists for the resurrection story of Jesus have used this fact—that women were the first to see Jesus—as powerful evidence for the veracity of the story.</p>
        <p>In <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:14">Mark 16:14</span></strong>, Jesus rebukes the 11 disciples for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen. This makes no sense if the story were a fabrication. Why rebuke the disciples for something the author could have easily written differently?</p>

    text: `
        <p>The first words of Jesus to His disciples are recorded only in indirect discourse in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:14">Mark 16:14</span></strong>. He rebukes them for their unbelief and hardheartedness. This question of unbelief is not simply a modern problem. As we already have seen, the original disciples of Jesus struggled with belief (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:17">Matthew 28:17</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:24-29">John 20:24-29</span></strong>), and they were with Jesus in the flesh and saw, again and again, the miracles.</p>
        <p>But by various proofs, He demonstrated to them the reality of His resurrection. Their testimony, combined with the evidence summarized earlier, forms a firm foundation for faith.</p>
        <p>Jesus then commissions His disciples to take the gospel to the world. His command is expansive: they are to go to the entire world and proclaim the gospel to all creation. Jesus explains the outcome of their work—believers will be saved, unbelievers condemned.</p>
        <p>Jesus also describes signs that will accompany the disciples’ work—casting out demons, speaking new languages, protection from harm, and healing the sick. Some have mistakenly interpreted <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:18">Mark 16:18</span></strong> as a call for Christians to prove their faith by handling venomous snakes. However, no such action is authorized here. Jesus describes protection in mission, as shown in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 28:3-6">Acts 28:3-6</span></strong> when Paul was unharmed after a snake bite.</p>
        <p>The Bible does not teach that Christians will always be protected from harm. Sometimes God works miracles to further the gospel, while other times Christians may suffer for their witness. In such moments, their endurance becomes a testimony of faith to unbelievers.</p>
        <p>After His words, “He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:19">Mark 16:19</span></strong>, NKJV). Jesus ascended to the place of supreme power, having defeated all the forces of evil.</p>
        <p>Notice the final verse: though the disciples went “everywhere,” preaching the gospel, they did not go alone. “The Lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying signs. Amen” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:20">Mark 16:20</span></strong>, NKJV). He was with them then, and He promises to be with us as we continue their work.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I am with you always, even to the end of the age’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:20">Matthew 28:20</span></strong>, NKJV). What comfort can we take from this promise as we, too, seek to proclaim the gospel everywhere?</p>

        <p>Read Ellen G. White, <em>‘The Lord Is Risen,’</em> pp. 779–787; <em>‘Go Teach All Nations,’</em> pp. 818–828, in <em>The Desire of Ages</em>.</p>
        <p>“To the believer, Christ is the resurrection and the life. In our Saviour the life that was lost through sin is restored; for He has life in Himself to quicken whom He will. He is invested with the right to give immortality. The life that He laid down in humanity, He takes up again, and gives to humanity. ‘I am come,’ He said, ‘that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.’ ‘Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.’ ‘Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.’ <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:10">John 10:10</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:14">John 4:14</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:54">John 6:54</span></strong>.</p>
        <p>“To the believer, death is but a small matter. Christ speaks of it as if it were of little moment. ‘If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death,’ ‘he shall never taste of death.’ To the Christian, death is but a sleep, a moment of silence and darkness. The life is hid with Christ in God, and ‘when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.’ <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:51-52">John 8:51, 52</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Colossians 3:4">Colossians 3:4</span></strong>.”—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, pp. 786, 787.</p>
        <p>Even atheist historians, those who cannot accept the reality of the Resurrection, admit not only that Jesus had been killed but that after His death many people claimed to have seen the resurrected Christ, and as a result they began the nucleus of what became the Christian church. Some, in an attempt to explain why they claimed this, said that Jesus had a twin brother or that the early disciples hallucinated, thinking that they saw Jesus. Others said that Jesus never really died but only swooned and then, later, revived. Another person claimed that aliens came down and took the body. For a look at all these arguments and how they don’t work, see Clifford Goldstein, <em>Risen: Finding Hope in the Empty Tomb</em> (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press, 2021).</p>
        <h3>Discussion Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Why would the disciples have lied about the resurrection of Jesus? From all that we know, they faced nothing but hatred, alienation, and persecution for their belief. What would they have gained by making this story up?</li>

        <h3>A Church Built on Garbage</h3>
        <p><strong>By Andrew McChesney</strong></p>

        <p>Purna faced a seemingly impossible task. He had volunteered to plant a church in an unentered district of a major South Asian city, and he didn’t know where to start. He had moved to the district after volunteering to serve as a Global Mission pioneer. But how could he share his love for Christ with his non-Christian neighbors?</p>

        <p>“God, please help,” he prayed.</p>

        <p>Purna prayed for a week, but he still didn’t know where to start. But he did know one thing. He couldn’t stand the stench on the road outside his house. Piles of garbage and puddles of dirty rainwater mingled on the road. One morning, he saw that the garbage had blocked the gutters, and filthy water was overflowing onto the road. He decided to do something. Taking a long bamboo pole, he began picking away the trash from the gutters.</p>

        <p>As he worked, the neighbors noticed.</p>

        <p>“Did the city government send you to clean the road?” someone asked.</p>

        <p>Purna replied that he had not been hired to clean the road and that he simply lived on it. The neighbors were impressed. Nobody had ever cleaned the road before.</p>

        <p>“You’re a good man,” a neighbor said. “We need you here.”</p>

        <p>“Don’t ever leave here,” another said.</p>

        <p>As he cleaned the road, Purna became a local celebrity. Everyone knew him and was talking about him. People invited him into their homes.</p>

        <p>As he met the neighbors, he learned that one man was paralyzed on his left side. Purna, who had been trained in massage, offered to help. The man agreed, and Purna began to give massages. Every time they met, Purna prayed and then gave a massage. The man recovered fully.</p>

        <p>Neighbors were amazed to see the man in such good health.</p>

        <p>“Who healed you?” they asked.</p>

        <p>“Oh, it was the good man who cleans our road!” the man replied.</p>

        <p>Then the neighbors really wanted to get to know Purna. They began to ask for prayers and massages.</p>

        <p>Today, Purna has accomplished the seemingly impossible and planted a church. Eleven people have been baptized, and 20 others are studying the Bible. “Please pray for God to help us serve Him more and more,” Purna said. “Even today, I am cleaning the road. If I see garbage stuck in the drains, I clean it up.”</p>

        <p>Purna lives in a veiled country that Adventist Mission is not identifying so as to protect his work among a population often hostile to Christianity. Learn more about Global Mission pioneers on the Adventist Mission website: <a href="https://bit.ly/GMPioneers">bit.ly/GMPioneers</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Memory Text:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:30-31">John 20:30, 31</span></strong>, NKJV).</blockquote>
        <p>Why did John write his Gospel? Did he wish to emphasize Jesus’ miracles or some specific teachings of Jesus? What was the reason for writing what he did?</p>
        <p>Under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit, John explains why. He says that though many more things could be written about the life of Christ (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 21:25">John 21:25</span></strong>), the stories he included were written in order “that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:31">John 20:31</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>
        <p>This week we’re going to look at John's account of some of Jesus’ early miracles—from His turning water to wine at a wedding, to restoring to health someone’s very sick son, to the healing of the man at the pool of Bethesda.</p>
        <p>John calls these miracles “signs.” He does not mean something like a street sign, but rather a miraculous event that points toward a deeper reality: Jesus as the Messiah. In all these accounts, we see examples of people who responded by faith. And their examples invite us to do the same.</p>

        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 2:1-11">John 2:1–11</span></strong>. What sign did Jesus do at Cana, and how did this help His disciples in coming to believe in Him?</p>

        <p>Seeing Jesus perform the miracle of changing the water into wine provided evidence in favor of the disciples’ decision to follow Jesus. How could it not have been a powerful sign pointing to Him as being someone from God? (They probably were not yet ready to understand that He was God.)</p>

        <p>Moses was the leader of the Israelites, and he brought Israel out of Egypt by many “signs and wonders” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deuteronomy 6:22">Deuteronomy 6:22</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deuteronomy 26:8">Deuteronomy 26:8</span></strong>, NKJV). He was the one whom God used to free Israel from the Egyptians. (He was, in a sense, their “savior.”)</p>

        <p>God prophesied through Moses that a prophet would come who was like Moses. God asked Israel to hear Him (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deuteronomy 18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 17:5">Matthew 17:5</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 7:37">Acts 7:37</span></strong>). That “prophet” was Jesus and, in John 2, Jesus performed His first sign, which itself pointed back to the deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt.</p>

        <p>The river Nile was a key resource and a deity for the Egyptians. One of the plagues was directed at the river—the changing of its waters to blood. At Cana, Jesus performed a similar miracle but, instead of turning water into blood, He turned it into wine.</p>

        <p>The water came from six water pots used for purification purposes in Jewish rituals, linking the miracle even more closely to biblical themes of salvation. By recounting the incident of changing the water to wine, and thus referring back to the Exodus, John was pointing to Jesus as our Deliverer.</p>

        <p>What did the master of the feast think of the unfermented wine that Jesus provided? He was indeed surprised by the quality of the drink and, not knowing the miracle that Jesus had performed there, thought that they had saved the best for last.</p>

        <p>The Greek term <em>oinos</em> is used both for fresh and fermented grape juice (see <em>The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Dictionary</em>, p. 1177). Ellen G. White states that the juice produced by the miracle was not alcoholic (see “At the Marriage Feast,” <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 149). No doubt, those who knew what happened were astonished at what had taken place.</p>

        <p>What are your reasons for following Jesus? (We have been given many, haven’t we?)</p>

        <p>All through His earthly ministry, Jesus performed miracles that helped people believe in Him. John recorded these miracles so that others would believe in Jesus, as well.</p>

        <p><strong>Read</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:46-54">John 4:46–54</span>. Why does the evangelist make a connection back to the miracle at the wedding feast?</p>

        <p>In giving an account of the second sign that Jesus did in Galilee, John points back to the first sign at the wedding in Cana. John seems to be saying, The signs that Jesus did will help you see who Jesus is. Then, John adds, “This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:54">John 4:54</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>

        <p>At first, Jesus’ response to the nobleman’s plea may seem harsh. Yet, this official had made the healing of his son the criterion for believing in Jesus. Jesus read his heart and pinpointed the spiritual sickness that was more profound than his son’s life-threatening illness. Like a lightning bolt from a blue sky, the man suddenly recognized that his spiritual poverty could cost the life of his son.</p>

        <p>It is important to recognize that miracles, in and of themselves, did not prove that Jesus was the Messiah. Others have performed miracles. Some were true prophets, others false. Miracles reveal only the existence of the supernatural; they don’t, by themselves, mean that God must be the One doing them. (Satan can perform “miracles,” if by the word “miracles” we mean supernatural acts.)</p>

        <p>The nobleman in anguish cast himself on Jesus’ mercy, pleading with Him to heal his son. Jesus’ response was reassuring. He said, “ ‘Go; your son will live’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:50">John 4:50</span></strong>, ESV). The verb “will live” in Greek is actually in the present tense. This usage is called a “futuristic present,” where a future event is spoken of with such certainty as if it were already happening. The man did not rush home but, believing Jesus, got home the next day—finding that, exactly when Jesus had said those words, the fever left his son.</p>

        <p>What a powerful reason to believe in Jesus!</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Even if we were to see a miracle, what other criteria must we look at before automatically assuming it is from God?</p>

        <p>The next sign John records took place at the Pool of Bethesda (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:1-9">John 5:1–9</span></strong>). It was believed that an angel caused movement in the water and that the first sick person to enter the water would be healed. As a result, the porches of the pool were crowded with those hoping to be cured at the next occurrence. Jesus went to Jerusalem, and as He passed by the pool, He saw the waiting throng.</p>
        
        <p>What a sight it must have been, too! All these people, some surely quite ill, waiting and waiting by the water for a cure that surely will not come. What an opportunity for Jesus!</p>

        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:1-9">John 5:1–9</span></strong>. Because anyone by the pool obviously wanted to get well, why did Jesus ask the paralytic if he wanted to be healed (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:6">John 5:6</span></strong>)?</p>

        <p>When one has been sick a long time, the sickness becomes the norm. And strange as it may seem, it can sometimes be a bit disturbing to leave the disability behind. The man implies in his answer that he wants healing. The problem is that he is looking for it in the wrong place—while the One who made man’s legs is standing right in front of him. Little did the man know who was talking to him; although after the healing, he might have started to understand that Jesus was, indeed, Someone very special.</p>

        <p><strong>“Jesus does not ask this sufferer to exercise faith in Him. He simply says, ‘Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.’ But the man’s faith takes hold upon that word. Every nerve and muscle thrills with new life, and healthful action comes to his crippled limbs. Without question he sets his will to obey the command of Christ, and all his muscles respond to his will. Springing to his feet, he finds himself an active man. . . . Jesus had given him no assurance of divine help. The man might have stopped to doubt, and lost his one chance of healing. But he believed Christ’s word, and in acting upon it he received strength.”</strong>—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, pp. 202, 203.</p>

        <p>Jesus later encountered the man in the temple and said, “ ‘You have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:14">John 5:14</span></strong>, NKJV). What is the relationship between sickness and sin? Why must we understand that not all sickness is a direct result of specific sins in our life?</p>

        <p>Signs, wonders, and miracles, in and of themselves, don’t prove that something is of God. But, on the other hand, when they are of God, it’s a dangerous thing to reject them.</p>
        <p><strong>Read John 5:10–16.</strong> What lessons can we take away from the amazing hardness of the religious leaders’ hearts in regard to Jesus and the miracle He had just performed?</p>
        <p>When Jesus revealed Himself to the man who had been healed, the man immediately told the religious leaders that it was Jesus. One would think this would be a time to praise God, but instead, the leaders “persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:16">John 5:16</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>
        <p>Healings were allowed on the Sabbath only in an emergency. This man had been disabled for 38 years; thus, his healing was hardly an emergency. And then, too, what was the necessity of having him take up his bed? One would think that someone with the power from God to perform such a miracle would also know if it was permissible to carry a mat home on the Sabbath day. Clearly, Jesus was seeking to take them to deeper biblical truths beyond the man-made rules and regulations that had, in some cases, stifled true faith.</p>
        <p><strong>What do these other accounts teach about how spiritually hard people can become, regardless of the evidence?</strong> (Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:1-16">John 9:1–16</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 3:22-23">Mark 3:22, 23</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 12:9-14">Matthew 12:9–14</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>How could these religious leaders be so blind? The likely answer is that it was because of their own corrupt hearts, their false belief that the Messiah would deliver them from Rome now, and their love of power and lack of surrender to God. All these helped cause them to reject the truth that stood right before them.</p>

        <p><strong>Read John 5:38–42.</strong> What was Jesus’ warning? What can we learn from these words? That is, what could be in us that blinds us to the truths we need to know and apply to our own lives?</p>

        <p>The miracle by the Pool of Bethesda provided an excellent opportunity for John to emphasize who Jesus is. John takes nine verses to describe the miracle and about 40 verses to describe the One who performed the miracle.</p>

        <p><strong>Read <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:16-18">John 5:16–18</span></strong>. Why was Jesus persecuted for His action on the Sabbath?</p>

        <p><strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:18">John 5:18</span></strong> can be disturbing because it seems to say that Jesus was breaking the Sabbath. However, a closer look at <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:16-18">John 5:16–18</span></strong> shows that Jesus argues that His “work” on the Sabbath is in line with His relationship to His Father. God does not stop sustaining the universe on the Sabbath. Consequently, Jesus’ Sabbath activity was part of His claim to divinity. The religious leaders persecuted Him on the basis of supposed Sabbath-breaking and a claim to equality with God.</p>

        <p><strong>Read <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:19-47">John 5:19–47</span></strong>. What was Jesus saying in order to help the leaders see Him for who He truly is, a claim so powerfully attested by the miracle He had just done?</p>

        <p>Jesus defends His actions in three steps. First, He explains His intimate relationship with the Father (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:19-30">John 5:19–30</span></strong>). Jesus indicates that He and His Father act in harmony, to the point that Jesus has the power both to judge and to raise the dead (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:25-30">John 5:25–30</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>Second, Jesus calls four “witnesses” in rapid succession to His defense—John the Baptist (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:31-35">John 5:31–35</span></strong>), the miracles Jesus does (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:36">John 5:36</span></strong>), the Father (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:37-38">John 5:37, 38</span></strong>), and the Scriptures (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:39">John 5:39</span></strong>). Each of these “witnesses” gives testimony in favor of Jesus.</p>

        <p>Finally, in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:40-47">John 5:40–47</span></strong>, Jesus sets before His accusers their own condemnation, revealing the contrast between His ministry and their self-seeking. Their condemnation, He says, will come from Moses (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:45-47">John 5:45–47</span></strong>), the one in whom they have set their hopes.</p>

        <p>How can we be careful not to fall into the trap of believing in God, even having correct doctrines, but not surrendering fully to Christ? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.</p>

        <p>“Jesus had given him [the disabled man] no assurance of divine help. The man might have stopped to doubt, and lost his one chance of healing. But he believed Christ’s word, and in acting upon it he received strength.</p>

        <p>“Through the same faith we may receive spiritual healing. By sin we have been severed from the life of God. Our souls are palsied. Of ourselves we are no more capable of living a holy life than was the impotent man capable of walking. . . . Let these desponding, struggling ones look up. The Saviour is bending over the purchase of His blood, saying with inexpressible tenderness and pity, ‘Wilt thou be made whole?’ He bids you arise in health and peace. Do not wait to feel that you are made whole. Believe His word, and it will be fulfilled. Put your will on the side of Christ. Will to serve Him, and in acting upon His word you will receive strength. Whatever may be the evil practice, the master passion which through long indulgence binds both soul and body, Christ is able and longs to deliver. He will impart life to the soul that is ‘dead in trespasses.’ <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Ephesians 2:1">Eph. 2:1</span></strong>. He will set free the captive that is held by weakness and misfortune and the chains of sin.” —Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 203.</p>

        <p>“Jesus repelled the charge of blasphemy. My authority, He said, for doing the work of which you accuse Me, is that I am the Son of God, one with Him in nature, in will, and in purpose.” —The Desire of Ages, p. 208.</p>

        <p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>

        <p>Reflect upon this week’s lesson. Faith was the key that made these healings possible. The leaders, in contrast, revealed the dangers of doubt and unbelief. Why must we not confuse having questions (which we all do) with having doubt? Why are they not the same thing, and why is it important to know the difference between them?</p>

        <p>Look at Thursday’s final question. Why, as Seventh-day Adventists, must we be especially careful about this danger? However important, for instance, knowing and even keeping the right Sabbath day, or knowing about the state of the dead—why do these truths not save us? What does save us, and how?</p>

        <p>Look carefully at John 5:47. How are those today who, for instance, deny the universality of the Flood, or the literal six-day Creation, doing exactly what Jesus warned against here?</p>
