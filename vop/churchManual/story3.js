                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Church organization is based on God’s principles. “Never allow 
anyone’s ideas to unsettle your faith in regard to the order and harmony which 
should exist in the church. . . . The God of heaven is a God of order, and He 
requires all His followers to have rules and regulations, and to preserve 
order.”—5T 274.

                <h2>Biblical Basis for Organization</h2>
                <p>When God called the children of Israel out of Egypt and chose them as 
His peculiar people, He provided for them an impressive system of 
organization to govern their conduct in both civil and religious matters.
“The government of Israel was characterized by the most thorough 
organization, wonderful alike for its completeness and its simplicity. The 
order so strikingly displayed in the perfection and arrangement of all God’s 
created works was manifest in the Hebrew economy. God was the center of 
authority and government, the sovereign of Israel. Moses stood as their
visible leader, by God’s appointment, to administer the laws in His name. 
From the elders of the tribes a council of seventy was afterward chosen to 
assist Moses in the general affairs of the nation. Next came the priests, who 
consulted the Lord in the sanctuary. Chiefs, or princes, ruled over the tribes. 
Under these were ‘captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and 
captains over fifties, and captains over tens,’ and, lastly, officers who might 
be employed for special duties.”—PP 374.
The New Testament church showed the same perfection in its 
organization. Christ Himself, who formed the church (Matt. 16:18), “set the 
members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased” (1 Cor. 12:18). 
He endowed them with gifts and talents adequate for the functions devolving 
upon them and organized them into a living, working body, of which He is 
the head.
“For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not 
the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and 
individually members of one another” (Rom. 12:4, 5). “And He [Christ] is 
the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the 
dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence” (Col. 1:18).
“There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences 
of ministries, but the same Lord” (1 Cor. 12:4, 5). “For as the body is one and
has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are 
one body, so also is Christ” (1 Cor. 12:12). “Now you are the body of Christ,
and members individually. And God has appointed these in the church: first
apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of
healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues” (1 Cor. 12:27, 28).

                <h2>Importance of Organization</h2>
                <p>Just as there can be no living, active human body unless its members are 
organically united and functioning together, so there can be no living, 
growing, prospering church unless its members are organized into a united 
spiritual body, all performing their God-given duties and functions under the 
direction of a divinely constituted authority. Without organization no 
institution or movement can prosper. A nation without organized government 
would be chaos. A business enterprise without organization would fail. A 
church without organization would disintegrate and perish.
            
For the sake of the Church’s healthy development and for the 
accomplishment of its task of carrying the gospel of salvation to all the world, 
Christ gave it a simple but effective system of organization. Success in its 
endeavors to achieve its mission depends on loyal adherence to this divine 
pattern.
            
“Some have advanced the thought that as we near the close of time, every 
child of God will act independently of any religious organization. But I have 
been instructed by the Lord that in this work there is no such thing as every 
man’s being independent.”—TM 489.
            
“Oh, how Satan would rejoice if he could succeed in his efforts to get in 
among this people and disorganize the work at a time when thorough 
organization is essential and will be the greatest power to keep out spurious 
uprisings and to refute claims not endorsed by the Word of God! We want to 
hold the lines evenly, that there shall be no breaking down of the system of 
organization and order that has been built up by wise, careful labor. License 
must not be given to disorderly elements that desire to control the work at 
this time.”—TM 489.

                <h2>Missionary Purposes of Organization</h2>
                <p>Our mission remains unchanged wherever we find ourselves in the 
world. The Seventh-day Adventist Church has been organized for the purpose 
of mission. However, the way in which we fulfill that mission will of 
necessity take a variety of forms due to different cultural and societal norms. 

            As we seek to share the gospel in cross-cultural contexts, we will encounter 
societies where particular religious bodies deem other writings as sacred, 
where restrictions to religious freedom sometimes exist, where diverse points 
of view and practices occur, as well as other challenges. To fulfill the mission 
in such diverse contexts, we rely on the guidance of the Holy Spirit and 
employ a flexible approach to sharing God’s love in a manner that reaches 
hearts, while preserving our unique calling and identity as Seventh-day 
Adventists.
            
The conditions Seventh-day Adventists face in sharing the message of 
Jesus to people of other religions largely parallel those that the apostles 
encountered. How they went about the mission is instructive for us today. 
Although they modified their approach in keeping with the audience, they 
never deviated from proclaiming the uniqueness of Jesus as the hope of the 
world. They never suggested that they had come to help their hearers find a 
deeper spiritual experience within their own religions; on the contrary, they 
challenged them to turn to the salvation provided in Christ.
            
Groups should be formed to lead all people into a saving relationship 
with Jesus Christ and into fellowship with the remnant church. In forming 
such groups, a theologically sound, culturally informed plan of action should 
be prayerfully developed and followed to guide these new believers into 
membership. These groups should be established and nurtured in 
collaboration with local administration and guidelines of the world Church. 
Leaders of these groups should seek to lead the people into membership in 
the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
            
The church is a missionary community and its organization exists to 
fulfill this purpose.
            
“As our numbers increased, it was evident that without some form of 
organization there would be great confusion, and the work would not be
carried forward successfully. To provide for the support of the ministry, for 
carrying the work in new fields, for protecting both the churches and the 
ministry from unworthy members, for holding church property, for the 
publication of the truth through the press, and for many other objects, 
organization was indispensable.”—TM 26.
            
“As members of the visible church, and workers in the vineyard of the 
Lord, all professed Christians should do their utmost to preserve peace, 
harmony, and love in the church. Mark the prayer of Christ: ‘That they all 
may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be 
one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.’ The unity of the 
church is the convincing evidence that God has sent Jesus into the world as 
its Redeemer.”—5T 619, 620.

                <h2>The New Testament Model</h2>
                <p>The Savior’s commission to the church to carry the gospel to all the 
world (Matt. 28:19, 20; Mark 16:15) meant not only preaching the gospel but 
ensuring the welfare of those who accepted that message. This involved 
shepherding as well as housing the flock, and also meeting relationship 
problems. Such a situation called for organization.
            
At first the apostles constituted a council that directed the activities of 
the church from Jerusalem (Acts 6:2; 8:14). When the company there became 
so large that the administration of its practical affairs became a problem, the 
church appointed deacons to care for its business (Acts 6:2-4).
            
Later other congregations grew up, not only in Asia but also in Europe, 
and this called for further organizational steps. In Asia Minor elders were 
ordained “in every church” (Acts 14:23). Extension of the work throughout 
the various provinces of the Roman Empire called for organization of 
churches into what might be called conferences (Gal. 1:2). Thus, step by step, 
organization grew in the early church. As needs arose, God directed the 
leaders of His work so that, in counsel with the church, they developed a form 
of organization that safeguarded the interests of the work.

                <h2>Church Organization Today</h2>
                <p>The Seventh-day Adventist form of governance is representative, which 
recognizes that authority rests in the membership and is expressed through 
duly elected representatives at each level of organization, with executive 
responsibility delegated to representative bodies and officers for the 
governing of the Church at each separate level. The Church Manual applies 
this principle of representation to the operations of the local congregation. 
Issues of representation in organizations with mission status are defined by 
operating policies and in organizations with conference status by their 
constitution and bylaws. This form of governance recognizes also that 
ordination to the ministry is recognized by the Church worldwide. 
“Every member of the church has a voice in choosing officers of the
church. The church chooses the officers of the state conferences. Delegates 
chosen by the state conferences choose the officers of the union conferences, 
and delegates chosen by the union conferences choose the officers of the 
General Conference. By this arrangement every conference, every institution, 
every church, and every individual, either directly or through representatives, 
has a voice in the election of the men who bear the chief responsibilities in 
the General Conference.”—8T 236, 237.
            
The present organizational system of the Church resulted from a 
developing theological understanding of the mission of the Church, 
membership growth, and the Church’s geographic spread. Representatives of 
conferences met in 1863 to organize the General Conference of Seventh-day 
Adventists.
            
There are several organizational levels within the Church leading from 
the individual believer to the worldwide organization of the work. 
Membership units in each of these levels periodically convene formal 
business sessions known as constituency meetings or sessions. (The 
constituency meeting or session of a local church is generally referred to as a
business meeting.) In Seventh-day Adventist Church structure, no 
organization determines its own status, nor does it function as if it had no 
obligations to the Church family beyond its boundaries.

                <h2>Outline of Denominational Organization</h2>
                <p>1. Local Church—A group of members in a defined location that has 
been granted, by the constituency of a conference in session, official status 
as a church.
            
2. Local Conference—A group of local churches, within a defined 
geographical area, that has been granted, by action of a division executive 
committee at midyear, year-end, or division council meeting, official status 
as a Seventh-day Adventist local conference/mission/field and subsequently 
accepted, at a union constituency meeting, into the sisterhood of 
conferences/missions. (See p. 19.)
            
3. Union of Churches—A group of churches, within a defined 
geographical area, that has been granted, by a General Conference Session, 
official status as a union of churches with either conference or mission status.
            
4. Union Conference/Mission—A group of conferences, within a 
defined geographical area, that has been granted, by a General Conference 
Session, official status as a union conference/mission.
            
5. General Conference and Its Divisions—The General Conference
represents the worldwide expression of the Church. Its constituent 
membership is defined in its Constitution. To facilitate its worldwide activity, 
the General Conference has established regional offices, known as divisions 
of the General Conference, which have been assigned, by action of the 
General Conference Executive Committee at Annual Councils, general 
administrative oversight for designated groups of unions and other Church
units within specific geographical areas.
            
The Bible is the foundation and source of belief and practice; on this 
basis, the General Conference in Session determines the stated Fundamental 
Beliefs of the Church. The General Conference in Session also authorizes 
establishment of unions and the attachment of field units, revises the Church 
Manual, elects General Conference and division leadership, performs other 
functions as outlined in its Constitution and Bylaws, and considers items 
referred to it by its Executive Committee. The General Conference Executive 
Committee between Sessions is empowered by the Constitution and Bylaws 
to act on behalf of the constituents. Thus, Church organizations around the 
world recognize the General Conference in Session as the voice of the 
Church.

                <h2>Role of Institutions</h2>
                <p>The constituent levels of the Church operate a variety of educational, 
health-care, publishing, and other institutions reaching out in the name of 
Christ to meet the needs of a distraught world. In Seventh-day Adventist 
theology and philosophy these institutions from their inception have been 
indispensable instruments for carrying out the Church’s spiritual mission of 
serving the whole person and taking the gospel to the world.
            
No Church organization or institution assumes responsibility for the 
liabilities, debts, acts, or omissions of any other Church organization simply 
because of its Church affiliation.</p>

                <h2>Authority in the Early Church</h2>
                <p>As Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer, Lord and King of all creation, God 
alone is the source of authority for the Church. He delegated authority to His
prophets and apostles (2 Cor. 10:8). They, therefore, occupied a crucial and 
unique position in the transmission of the Word of God and the edification of 
the church (Eph. 2:20).
            
The early church bore responsibility for purity in doctrine and practice. 
The elders (or bishops) held great authority. One of their main functions was 
general pastoral care and oversight (Acts 20:17-28; Heb. 13:17; 
1 Peter 5:1-3), with special tasks such as giving instruction in sound doctrine 
and refuting those who contradicted it (1 Tim. 3:1, 2; Titus 1:5, 9). They were 
instructed to “test the spirits, whether they are of God” (1 John 4:1) or, in 
Paul’s terms, to “test all things” and “hold fast what is good” (1 Thess. 5:21).
            
The same was true regarding its exercise of discipline (Matt. 18:15-17), 
which ranged from private and caring admonition (cf. Matt. 18:16; Gal. 6:1) 
to removal from membership (Matt. 18:18; 1 Cor. 5:11, 13; 2 Cor. 2:5-11).
The Church thus has authority to settle the rules for its own governance.

                <h2>General Conference the Highest Authority</h2>
                <p>In the Church today the General Conference Session, and the General 
Conference Executive Committee between Sessions, is the highest 
ecclesiastical authority in the administration of the Church. The General 
Conference Executive Committee is authorized by its Constitution to create 
subordinate organizations with authority to carry out their roles. Therefore,
all subordinate organizations and institutions throughout the Church will 
recognize the General Conference Session, and the General Conference 
Executive Committee between Sessions, as the highest ecclesiastical 
authority, under God, among Seventh-day Adventists.
            
When differences arise in or between churches and conferences or 
institutions, matters that are not mutually resolved may be appealed to the 
next higher organization. If the matter does not get resolved at this level, the 
aggrieved entity may appeal to successively higher levels of organization. An 
organization to which an appeal is forwarded may choose not to hear the 
matter, in which case the decision of the highest organization involved in the 
dispute shall be final. When organizations review decisions of other 
organizations, they do not assume responsibility for the liabilities of any other 
organization.
            
“I have often been instructed by the Lord that no man’s judgment should 
be surrendered to the judgment of any other one man. Never should the mind 
of one man or the minds of a few men be regarded as sufficient in wisdom 
and power to control the work and to say what plans shall be followed. But 
when, in a General Conference, the judgment of the brethren assembled from 
all parts of the field is exercised, private independence and private judgment 
must not be stubbornly maintained, but surrendered. Never should a laborer 
regard as a virtue the persistent maintenance of his position of independence, 
contrary to the decision of the general body.”—9T 260.
