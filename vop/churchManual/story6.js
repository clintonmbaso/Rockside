                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Making disciples is a continuous process by which a person becomes a 
disciple of Jesus Christ, matures as His disciple, and makes more disciples. 
Baptism is an essential part of the discipleship process, but it is not the end 
result of that process.
            
Seventh-day Adventists accept with honor and humility the command of 
Jesus contained in the Gospel Commission to “go therefore and make 
disciples of all the nations” (Matt. 28:19). We are to obey this Commission, 
as we live in these last days, within the context of the Three Angels’ Messages 
(Rev. 14:6-12).
            
The Gospel Commission’s main emphasis to “make disciples” contains 
three parts:
            
1. “Go therefore and make disciples” is Jesus’ command to fulfill the 
mission. Thus, making disciples should be our way of life. We are to go and 
make disciples in our homes, our work, our schools, and in our everyday 
interactions with others. We are to make disciples of every nation, tribe, 
language, and people. The goal of witnessing and evangelism is disciplemaking (Matt. 10:25, Matt. 28:19, 20).

            2. “Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Spirit,” is not the end goal but an important part in the process of 
discipleship as people acknowledge Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, 
become part of His church, and commit to making more disciples. Disciples 
are baptized into Christ’s body, the church. Their commitment to obey Christ 
in making disciples should be demonstrated before baptism.

            3. “Teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you,” 
indicates that teaching is a vital and ongoing experience of maturing in the 
experience of discipleship. “Teaching” should take place before and after 
baptism.
            
Making disciples is a continuous process with its purpose being grown 
“in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 
3:18) into Christian maturity and multiplication of disciples.
            
Growing as a disciple and making disciples to prepare them for the 
second coming of Jesus, is not optional; it is the essence of our last-day 
commission as Seventh-day Adventists. Genuine discipleship only happens 
as a result of the amazing grace of Jesus Christ. We can take comfort that all 
authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him, and He promises to 
be with us to the end of the world (Matt. 28:18, 20). Further, He promises us 
the Holy Spirit as our Teacher, Guide, and Power (John 16:7-16; Luke 24:46-
49; Acts 1:4, 5, 8; 2:37-39).

                <h2>What is a Disciple?</h2>
                <p>In Jesus’ time, disciples were followers whose instruction was wholistic 
and comprehensive. The disciples of Jesus spent so much time with Him that 
they received His teachings and learned valuable lifestyle lessons. A disciple 
is one whose choices, decisions, and worldview are being transformed by the 
Holy Spirit through the Word of God.
Christian disciples pattern their faith, character, and mission after the 
faith, character, and mission of their Teacher, Jesus. A disciple is one who 
has made a commitment to follow Christ and bring their life under the 
Lordship of Christ.
A disciple is a person who is becoming more like Jesus Christ in every 
way (Eph. 4:15). The process of disciple-making is a continuous process. It 
also entails teaching new believers how to bring their lives into conformity 
with the Word of God through various programs such as mentoring, small 
group ministries, Bible studies, service, etc.
1. Thus, discipleship impacts every area of our lives: our beliefs, 
character, lifestyle, relationships, work, entertainment, finances, health, 
witness, and our burden to see others in God’s kingdom. 
2. “Is becoming” indicates that discipleship is an ongoing activity of 
following Jesus. 
3. “More like Jesus Christ” means that Christ is our Savior and Lord 
and the only perfect example for us to follow.

                <h2>Growth of a Disciple</h2>
                <p>The discipleship journey starts when one takes the first steps toward 
Jesus (see John 1:35-2:2). Abiding in Him daily and following His Word, one 
can continue to grow in Christlikeness. Some of the key areas in which 
Scripture indicates disciples must mature in personal development, as well as 
part of a community of believers, are listed below: 
1. Worship/Personal Devotion: “You shall love the LORD your God 
with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind” (Matt. 22:37 
ESV). Worship is our response to God’s initiating work in our lives. True 
worship is not focused on us but on God (Ps. 150:6; John 4:23; Rev. 14:7).
“We need to cherish and cultivate a spirit of true worship, a spirit of 
devotion upon the Lord’s holy, sanctified day. We should assemble together 
believing that we shall receive comfort and hope, light and peace from Jesus 
Christ.”—FLB 35.
“Personal religion will reveal itself in bearing good fruit, sanctification 
is not the work of a day, but a lifetime. . . .There should be in the heart of 
everyone grace which can bloom in the garden of God. Selfishness will cut 
out every precious likeness of Christ, will expel humility and self-denial and 
devotion.” —PM 91.
2. Ministry to Others: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” 
(Matt. 22:39 ESV). Every disciple is called and gifted by God for the benefit 
of the church and to take the gospel message to the world (1 Peter 2:9; 4:10).
“[The disciples’] office was the most important to which human beings 
had ever been called, second only to that of Christ Himself. They were to be 
workers together with God for the saving of men.”—AA 19.
3. Witnessing/Need-Based Evangelism: “Go therefore and make 
disciples of all nations . . . .” (Matt. 28:19 ESV). Witness and evangelism 
happen best when following Christ’s method of ministry to the whole person. 
“Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The 
Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His 
sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then 
He bade them, ‘Follow Me.’”—MH 143.
4. Obedience: “. . . . teaching them to observe all that I have 
commanded you” (Matt. 28:20 ESV). A primary indication of true 
discipleship is faithfulness to Christ and His Word and submission to Him as 
our Lord. Jesus said, “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments” 
(John 14:15 ESV).
“Obedience—the service and allegiance of love—is the true sign of 
discipleship. Thus, the Scripture says, ‘This is the love of God, that we keep 
His commandments’”—SC 60.
A faithful disciple is one who recognizes the Shepherd’s voice and 
continually seeks to learn in order to obey more completely. Reflecting 
Christ’s character and laboring for the enlargement of His kingdom is to be 
our overriding passion. This includes growth in character, stewardship and 
service (Eph. 4:13-15; Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:17, 18; 1 John 3:2).
5. Community/Outreach: “. . . . baptizing them in the name of the 
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matt. 28:19 ESV). True 
discipleship only happens within a community that is built on the foundation 
of Jesus Christ and His Word, where worship, ministry, evangelism, and 
obedience are given the highest priority (Rev. 14:6-12).
“Let small companies assemble in the evening, at noon, or in the early 
morning to study the Bible. Let them have a season of prayer, that they may
be strengthened, enlightened, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit. This work 
Christ wants to have done in the heart of every worker. If you yourselves will 
open the door to receive it, a great blessing will come to you. Angels of God 
will be in your assembly. You will feed upon the leaves of the tree of life. 
What testimonies you may bear of the loving acquaintance made with your 
fellow workers in these precious seasons when seeking the blessing of 
God.”—7T 195.

                <h2>Practical Steps</h2>
                <p>The grace of Jesus Christ is not cheap. It cost Him His life. Anyone who 
accepts Jesus Christ as both Lord and Savior needs to know that being His 
disciple also comes at a cost. “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny 
themselves and take up their cross and follow me” (Mark 8:34, NIV).
Disciples grow Christlike in character amid the routines of day-to-day 
life. Through the intentional practices of daily Bible study, prayer, service, 
and mission, we grow ever deeper in our discipleship commitment. A fully 
committed disciple continually “walks” with Christ, being with Him, 
modeling one’s life after Him, and obeying Him in one’s ordinary daily 
activities. 
The work of making disciples is ongoing. “The Saviour’s commission to 
the disciples included all the believers. It includes all believers in Christ to 
the end of time.”—DA 822. Therefore, patterning one’s life after Jesus’ 
example is a personal responsibility as well as a teaching responsibility that 
every church member owes to those who are young in the faith. Church 
membership and even church activity by themselves are insufficient. 
Ongoing personal growth as a disciple is necessary to have an impactful and 
lasting relationship with God.

                <h2>Love, The Defining Mark of a Disciple</h2>
                <p>Loving others as God loves us, which is intimately connected to unity, is 
the ultimate indication of true discipleship. “By this all people will know that 
you are my disciples, if you have love one for another” (John 13:35, ESV).
            
“Christ has given us a pattern in his own example. He would bind his 
followers to one another and to himself. Their oneness with Christ makes 
them love one another, for love is the sure fruit of unity with Christ. Christ 
declared that their love for one another was a sure badge of their 
discipleship”—Ms 51, 1894.
            
True love for Jesus means more than His disciples loving each other; 
they must share God’s love with others. If we love God, we will obey his 
command to “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. . . . ” (Matt. 
28:19).
            
God’s love is the defining mark of a disciple because in love all other 
characteristics of discipleship are complete. Christ “mentioned only one 
condition of discipleship and service. ‘Lovest thou Me?’ He said. This is the 
essential qualification”—DA 815. “The love of Christ is not a fitful feeling, 
but a living principle, which is to be made manifest as an abiding power in 
the heart. . .”—RC 345.
