    <h3>ABOUT PATHFINDER MINISTRY</h3>
    <p>The Pathfinder Ministry is a worldwide program organized and directed by the Youth Department of the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It offers a wide range of learning experiences for young people 10 to 15 years of age and is operated by the local Seventh-day Adventist church under the direction and control of the local conference youth director. Each Pathfinder Club is administered by a club director, deputy directors, counselors, instructors, chaplain, secretary, and treasurer. The club is divided into separate units, each unit averaging between six to eight Pathfinders, including a captain and scribe.</p>

  <h3>Pathfinder Aim</h3>
  <p>The Advent Message to all the world in my generation.</p>
  <p>Explanation:  My relationship to Jesus Christ is of such a nature that it compels me to share with any who will receive it, the gospel—the good news of His soon return.</p>
  
    <hr>
 <h3>Pathfinder Motto</h3>
  <p>The love of Christ compels us.</p>
  <p>Explanation: I am drawn to Him by His exemplary life, the symbolic act of His crucifixion, His conquering resurrection, and His promise of an earth made new in the pattern of the original creation.  The closer I find myself to Him, the closer I find myself identifying with the needs of my fellow human beings.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p><strong>Keep the Morning Watch</strong> - I will have prayer and personal bible study each day.</p> 
  <p><strong>Do my honest part</strong> - By the power of God I will help others, and do my duty and my honest share, wherever I may be.</p> 
  <p><strong>Care for my body</strong> - I will be temperate in all things and strive to reach a higher standard of physical fitness.</p>

  <h4>Pathfinder Flag</h4>
  <img src="images/Pathfinder Flag.jpg" alt="Pathfinder Flag">
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <p>The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials, cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts.</p>
  <p>The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand corner being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background.</p>
  <p>The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence.</p>
  <p>The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).</p>
  
 <hr>
    <h4>Pathfinder Emblem</h4>
  <img src="images/2. Pathfinder Logo.png" alt="Pathfinder Logo">
    <h4>Meaning of the Pathfinder Emblem</h4>
  
    <p><strong><span style="color: red;">RED (SACRIFICE)</span></strong> - Reminds us of Christ. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) “Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God” (Rom. 12: 1).</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: gold;">GOLD (EXCELLENCE)</span></strong> - “I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich” (Rev. 3:18). Standard of measurement. The Pathfinder Club has high standards to help build strong character for the kingdom of heaven.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: white;">WHITE (PURITY)</span></strong> - “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment” (Rev. 3:5). We desire to have the purity and righteousness of Christ’s life in our lives.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">BLUE (LOYALTY)</span></strong> - It is the purpose of the Pathfinder Club to help teach us to be loyal to: Our God in heaven. Our parents. Our church. Loyalty is defined as a reflection of the character of our True Master Guide.</p>
    <p><strong>THREE SIDES</strong> - Completeness of the Trinity — Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Tripod of education: Mental Crafts and Honors Physical Campouts, work bee, health focus Spiritual Outreach and personal spiritual development.</p>
    <p><strong>SHIELD (PROTECTION)</strong> - In the Scripture God is often called the shield of His people.(Protection) “Fear not… I am thy shield” (Gen. 15:1) “Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.” (Eph. 6:16)</p>
    <p><strong>SWORD (BIBLE)</strong> - The sword is used in warfare. A battle is always won by offense. We are in a battle against sin, and our weapon is the Word of God. The sword of the Spirit is the Word of God. (see Eph. 6:17)</p>
    <p><strong>INVERTED TRIANGLE</strong> - The inverted order of importance Jesus taught which is contrary to that taught by the world. Sacrificing of one’s self by placing the needs of others ahead of our own.</p>
    <p><strong>PATHFINDER CLUB</strong> - The Pathfinder Club is one of the organizations of the world youth ministry of the Seventh-day AdventistChurch.</p>
  
    <h4>Pathfinder Anthem</h4>
  <p>Oh, we are the Pathfinders strong, The servants of God are we. Faithful as we march along, In kindness, truth, and purity. A Message to tell to the world, A truth that will set us free!. King Jesus the Savior's coming back, For you, and me!.</p>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>On March 3rd, 2024, a highly successful seminar was conducted at Kohima SDA Church from 10 to 16 hours specifically tailored for Adventist Youth Ministries Leaders and all interested participants within the District. The seminar focused on crucial topics of leadership, mentorship, conflict resolution, and basic staff training relevant to AYM and leadership roles.</p>

    <p><strong>Seminar Overview</strong></p>
    <p>The seminar was designed to equip attendees with essential skills and knowledge necessary for effective leadership within the district. They were empowered with practical insights and strategies to enhance their roles in mentoring and guiding the youths.</p>

    <p><strong>Attendees</strong></p>
    <p>The seminar attracted 43 attendees from various congregations of our two zones, all dedicated to strengthening their leadership abilities and impact within the church community. The participants exhibited enthusiasm and a strong commitment to youth ministry. Among the attendees was our special guest and instructor: MG Mokwani Nawa, a representative from Midlands East Zambia Conference.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Lessons Covered</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> An interactive session led by MG Mokwani focused on leadership styles suitable for youth engagement, effective communication with young people, decision-making in ministry contexts, and motivating youth involvement in church activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> The mentorship segment led by our KEMD Youth President MG Rabson emphasized the importance of mentorship in nurturing young believers. Attendees learned how to establish meaningful mentor-mentee relationships and guide youth through their spiritual journeys.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Practical strategies were shared by our Chaplain MG Melvin Mwila to help leaders identify and address conflicts within church settings positively and constructively. Real-life examples provided hands-on experience in resolving conflicts among youth.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Staff Training for Youth Leaders:</strong> Participants were introduced to essential staff training principles applicable to youth ministry, including effective onboarding techniques for new volunteers, skills development workshops, and performance management strategies for youth leaders by our Secretary Loveness Mwanza and Parliamentarian MG Morris Chibale.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Certifications</strong></p>
    <p>As a result of their dedication and proficiency demonstrated during the seminar, 21 leaders were awarded certifications in leadership, conflict resolution, and mentorship within our District during the Youth Day on March 16, 2024. These certifications acknowledge their commitment to enhancing AYM practices and fostering positive growth within their respective congregations.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>The seminar held on March 3rd, 2024, served as a valuable platform for leaders within KEMD to acquire practical skills and insights tailored to their unique ministry roles. The program's success underscores the importance of continuous education and development for effective youth leadership in the church.</p>

    <p>We extend our appreciation to all attendees, instructors, and organizers for their contributions to making this seminar a meaningful and impactful event for our District. We anticipate the positive ripple effects of this seminar on youth engagement and spiritual growth within our congregations.</p>

    <p><strong>Church Heritage Mock Exam - March 25, 2024</strong></p>
    <p>A mock exam in Church Heritage was conducted on March 25, 2024, across our two Zones. The exams were held at Lukanga SDA Church in Zone A and Rockside SDA Church in Zone B. A total of 16 candidates participated in these assessments, with only 3 candidates successfully passing. This results in a pass rate of 18.75%.</p>

    <p><strong>MEZC Final Exams - April 7, 2024</strong></p>
    <p>The final exams organized by Midlands East Zambia Conference (MEZC) were held on April 7, 2024, at Kabwe Adventist School (KAS) and Rockside SDA Church. The KAS center accommodated 10 candidates, while Rockside had 18 candidates. Out of the 28 candidates who sat for the exams, a commendable 20 candidates successfully passed. This results in a pass rate of approximately 71.43%.</p>

    <p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
    <p>It is with great pleasure that we acknowledge the improvement in participant numbers and pass rates in these assessments. The increase in successful candidates reflects the dedication and commitment of the participants and the effectiveness of the preparation and support provided by our leaders in various churches.</p>

    <p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
    <p>For those who did not succeed in these assessments and others who wish to sit for the same exams, it is important to continue preparing diligently. The education team is preparing to request another exam session from the conference to provide further opportunities for candidates to demonstrate their knowledge and skills.</p>

    <p>We encourage all interested parties to engage actively in their studies and take advantage of the upcoming exam opportunity to showcase their understanding of Church Heritage.</p>
