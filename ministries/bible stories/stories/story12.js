<h2>Increasingly Difficult Circumstances</h2>

<p>Ellen White warned the church that as the end approaches, the work will have to be done under increasingly difficult circumstances. A listing of just a few of these challenges includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strife, war, and jealousy</strong> among nations and tribes.</li>
  <li><strong>Instability</strong> in the business world.</li>
  <li><strong>Accidents</strong> by land, sea, and air.</li>
  <li><strong>Calamities</strong> in the natural world—floods, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Starvation and privation</strong> at unprecedented levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Undue nationalism and provincialism</strong> fragmenting society.</li>
  <li><strong>Political strife and turmoil.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Collapse of society</strong> through destruction of the family, loss of discipline, and moral perversion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these growing challenges, the mission continues, guided by faith and perseverance.</p>
            
<p>Because we, as church members, are also part of the society around us, these challenges impact us just as much as they do others. Sadly, we are not insulated from these difficulties. Therefore, we must seek ways to prevent the negative influences within our spheres of action and help others cope with those challenges over which there are no easy controls or solutions.</p>

<p>Among God's people, there should exist a spirit of love and brotherhood. Though scattered among all nations, we are to be united—not just in theory, but in practice.</p>

<p>Just as John the Baptist was the herald of the first coming of the Lord, the remnant church is called to herald the second coming. The church has continually adapted to the technological age, finding innovative ways to apply new inventions to its mission. While summarizing all these efforts in just a few paragraphs is challenging, here are a few evidences of the continued advance in proclaiming the three angels’ messages:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Based on 1997 data, more than 85 people are joining the church every hour.</li>
    <li>Almost three new churches are being organized every day.</li>
    <li>Airplanes have expanded the church’s transport network, with planes operating in Africa and South America. Pathfinders even helped finance and assemble a plane that went into mission service at the beginning of the new millennium.</li>
    <li>Public evangelism has expanded globally through satellite broadcasting, reaching hundreds of thousands in simultaneous live meetings, often referred to as the "Net 90s."</li>
    <li>Five-day Plans to Stop Smoking have helped hundreds of thousands quit one of the most harmful habits, creating a positive image of the church while improving lives.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>New departments and services have been established at various levels of church leadership, including Stewardship, Trust Services, Family Life, Children, Women, and, most recently, Global Mission, which aims to identify and reach every unreached people group worldwide.</li>
    <li>The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), formerly known as Seventh-day Adventist World Service (SAWS), has become a leading voluntary agency helping those affected by disasters or extreme poverty.</li>
    <li>State-of-the-art printing presses now produce many tons of books and periodicals annually.</li>
    <li>The Adventist educational system remains the largest Protestant parochial school system in the world, with 2000 data showing 4,809 elementary schools, 1,126 secondary schools, and 99 colleges and universities, enrolling over a million students.</li>
    <li>By 2000, the Inter-American Division had surpassed two million members, while the Africa-Indian Ocean Division, East African Division, and South American Division each had between 1.5 and 2 million members.</li>
    <li>In early 1978, the total world membership of the church reached 3 million; only 20 years later, in 1998, membership passed the 10 million mark. Members are now found in well over 200 countries (the UN lists 230). In 1978, the church expanded its influence through the use of 590 languages—by 1998, 735 languages were being used.</li>
    <li>More than 70% of the church membership comprises individuals under the age of 30.</li>
    <li>Missionaries continue to spread the Gospel to all parts of the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are but a few examples of the fulfillment of the commission to go “to every nation, and 
kindred, and tongue, and people.” </p>
