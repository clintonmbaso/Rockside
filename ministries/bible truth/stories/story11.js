  <h2>Lesson 42 - The Nature of Man</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Man’s Position</h3>
  <p>
    God created humankind as His <strong>crowning act of creation</strong>, intended to be the centerpiece of a beautiful world full of animals and plants.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:26-27:</strong> “Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.’”
  </p>
  <p>
    Humans reflect the “image of God” particularly in their <strong>mental capacities</strong> to reason, make choices, love, and fellowship with God.
    <br>
    <strong>Colossians 3:10:</strong> “And have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.”
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 8:5:</strong> “Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.”
  </p>
  <p>
    God entrusted the <strong>earth and its resources</strong> to humanity's care.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 1:28:</strong> “And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.’”
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 115:16:</strong> “The heavens are the Lord's heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man.”
  </p>

  <h3>2. Man’s Nature</h3>
  <p>
    God created the first human, Adam, by uniting the <strong>“breath of life”</strong> with a body of dust, which created a living soul.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 2:7:</strong> “Then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The human being is a union of physical, mental, and spiritual aspects, and none of these elements are immortal by nature.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Timothy 6:15-16:</strong> “...He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see...”
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>life-principle</strong> from God is what makes a human being live, and death is a reversal of this process.
    <br>
    <strong>Ecclesiastes 12:7:</strong> “And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.”
    <br>
    Death occurs when the breath of life returns to God.
    <br>
    <strong>Genesis 2:17:</strong> “But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”
    <br>
    The immortality of humankind is conditional upon obedience to God.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Man’s Condition in the Sin Situation</h3>
  <p>
    Through Adam’s fall, humanity became a sinful race, severed from the life of God and subject to death.
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 5:12:</strong> “Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned...”
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 3:23:</strong> “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”
    <br>
    Humankind, both in the Old and New Testaments, is seen as <strong>mortal</strong> and subject to death.
    <br>
    <strong>Job 4:17:</strong> “Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?”
  </p>

  <h3>4. Man’s Only Hope of Life is in Christ</h3>
  <p>
    Since humans do not have natural immortality, eternal life must be sought.
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 2:7:</strong> “To those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The gift of immortality is made possible through Jesus Christ and His gospel.
    <br>
    <strong>2 Timothy 1:10:</strong> “...which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel...”
    <br>
    <strong>John 3:16:</strong> “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 22:17:</strong> “The Spirit and the Bride say, 'Come.' And let the one who hears say, 'Come.' And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Believers in Christ are assured of eternal life.
    <br>
    <strong>1 John 5:11-13:</strong> “And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.”
    <br>
    Even if a believer dies, Christ promises to raise them.
    <br>
    <strong>John 6:40:</strong> “For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>resurrection</strong> of the dead will happen at Christ’s return.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 15:20-23:</strong> “But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.”
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 15:51-55:</strong> “Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The redeemed will receive immortality at Christ's second coming and be given glorified bodies.
    <br>
    <strong>Philippians 3:20-21:</strong> “But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body...”
  </p>

  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <p>
    The concept of “eternal torment” or “endless hell” is a man-made idea built upon the notion that humans have an “immortal soul.” Scripture teaches that humans are mortal by nature, and those who reject God’s offer of eternal life will perish in the “second death” (Revelation 20:14-15).
    <br>
    <strong>Romans 6:23:</strong> “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
  </p>

            Lesson 42 - The Nature of Man

Man's Position
God created humankind as His crowning act of creation, intended to be the centerpiece of a beautiful world full of animals and plants. In Genesis 1:26-27, we read, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.'" Humans reflect the image of God, particularly in their mental capacities to reason, make choices, love, and fellowship with God, as stated in Colossians 3:10: “And have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.” Psalm 8:5 reminds us, “Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.”

God entrusted the earth and its resources to humanity’s care. Genesis 1:28 says, "And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'" Psalm 115:16 reinforces this: “The heavens are the Lord's heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man.”

Man's Nature
God created the first human, Adam, by uniting the breath of life with a body of dust, which created a living soul. Genesis 2:7 says, “Then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.” The human being is a union of physical, mental, and spiritual aspects, and none of these elements are immortal by nature. As stated in 1 Timothy 6:15-16, God alone has immortality: “He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see.”

The life-principle from God is what makes a human being live, and death is a reversal of this process. Ecclesiastes 12:7 says, “And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.” Death occurs when the breath of life returns to God. Genesis 2:17 warns, “But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.” Immortality is conditional upon obedience to God.

Man's Condition in the Sin Situation
Through Adam’s fall, humanity became a sinful race, severed from the life of God and subject to death. Romans 5:12 tells us, “Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned…” And Romans 3:23 adds, “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” In both the Old and New Testaments, humankind is seen as mortal and subject to death. Job 4:17 asks, “Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?”

Man's Only Hope of Life is in Christ
Since humans do not have natural immortality, eternal life must be sought. Romans 2:7 states, “To those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.” The gift of immortality is made possible through Jesus Christ and His gospel. 2 Timothy 1:10 explains, “...which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel…” In John 3:16, we find the promise of eternal life: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” Revelation 22:17 invites, “The Spirit and the Bride say, 'Come.' And let the one who hears say, 'Come.' And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.”

Believers in Christ are assured of eternal life. 1 John 5:11-13 states, “And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.” Even if a believer dies, Christ promises to raise them. In John 6:40, Jesus says, “For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”

The resurrection of the dead will happen at Christ’s return. 1 Corinthians 15:20-23 assures us, “But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.” 1 Corinthians 15:51-55 further describes this: “Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.”

The redeemed will receive immortality at Christ's second coming and be given glorified bodies. Philippians 3:20-21 says, “But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body…”

  <h2>Lesson 43 - Condition of Man in Death</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Death Compared to Sleep</h3>
  <p>
    In the Bible, death is often compared to sleep, signifying a state of unconsciousness. 
    <br>
    <strong>John 11:11-14:</strong> “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go to awake him out of sleep.” 
    <br>
    Jesus referred to death as a sleep, as Lazarus had died and was about to be resurrected. 
    <br>
    <strong>Daniel 12:2:</strong> “And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” 
    <br>
    This text speaks of death as sleep, and it indicates that the dead will eventually be awakened at the resurrection.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Absolute Unconsciousness in Death</h3>
  <p>
    Both the righteous and the wicked are in a state of unconsciousness after death. The Bible makes it clear that the dead are unaware of anything. 
    <br>
    <strong>Ecclesiastes 9:5:</strong> “For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.”
    <br>
    This verse affirms that the dead are in a state of unconsciousness and have no knowledge of the present world.
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 115:17:</strong> “The dead do not praise the Lord, nor do any who go down into silence.”
    <br>
    This confirms that the dead are not in heaven praising God, as is sometimes mistakenly believed.
    <br>
    <strong>Job 7:9, 10:</strong> “As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up; he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore.”
    <br>
    The dead do not return to their earthly homes, further reinforcing the idea that death is a permanent state of unconsciousness.
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 146:3-4:</strong> “Do not put your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation. When his breath departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish.”
    <br>
    The thoughts of the departed cease upon death, underscoring that they are unaware of any ongoing events.
    <br>
    <strong>Psalm 6:5:</strong> “For in death there is no remembrance of You; in the grave who will give You thanks?”
    <br>
    This highlights that the dead do not have any knowledge of God or engage in praise after death.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Resurrection and Awakening</h3>
  <p>
    All who are sleeping the sleep of death will be awakened at the appointed time of resurrection.
    <br>
    <strong>Job 14:14:</strong> “If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my service I would wait, till my renewal comes.”
    <br>
    The dead must wait in the grave until their appointed time for resurrection comes.
    <br>
    <strong>Job 17:13:</strong> “If I wait, the grave is my house; I have made my bed in the darkness.”
    <br>
    This verse confirms that the grave is the place of waiting for the dead.
    <br>
    <strong>John 5:28-29:</strong> “Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.”
    <br>
    This passage teaches that all who have died will be resurrected, regardless of their character, to face either eternal life or judgment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The resurrection will occur at the second coming of Christ, with the righteous being raised first.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Thessalonians 4:16:</strong> “For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.”
    <br>
    This passage points to the resurrection of the just, which will happen at Christ's second advent.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 15:42-44:</strong> “So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.”
    <br>
    Paul explains that at the resurrection, the righteous will be changed, receiving a glorified and immortal body.
    <br>
    <strong>1 Corinthians 15:53-54:</strong> “For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: 'Death is swallowed up in victory.'”
    <br>
    At the resurrection, the righteous are immortalized, and death is defeated.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Second Resurrection and the Wicked</h3>
  <p>
    The resurrection of the wicked will occur at the end of the millennium.
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 20:6:</strong> “Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.”
    <br>
    Those who are raised in the first resurrection are blessed and will not experience the second death.
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 20:9:</strong> “And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them.”
    <br>
    This describes the fate of the wicked who will be resurrected at the close of the millennium to face final judgment.
    <br>
    <strong>Revelation 20:4-5:</strong> “Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed...The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.”
    <br>
    The unrighteous will be resurrected at the close of the millennium to face judgment and destruction.
  </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>
    The condition of man in death is one of complete unconsciousness. However, all will be awakened at the resurrection, whether to life or to judgment.
  </p>

            
            <!--
Lesson 43 - Condition of Man in Death

In this lesson, we will explore the biblical view of death, emphasizing that death is not an eternal state but rather a temporary condition before the resurrection.

1. Death Compared to Sleep
The Bible frequently compares death to sleep, symbolizing a state of unconsciousness. In John 11:11-14, Jesus refers to the death of Lazarus as sleep, stating, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go to awake him out of sleep.” This metaphor helps us understand death as a temporary condition. Similarly, in Daniel 12:2, it says, “And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” This passage further indicates that death is a temporary state, and those who have died will eventually be awakened during the resurrection.

2. Absolute Unconsciousness in Death
The Bible is clear that after death, both the righteous and the wicked enter a state of complete unconsciousness. Ecclesiastes 9:5 tells us, “For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.” This verse emphasizes that the dead are unaware of the present world. Psalm 115:17 further supports this idea, stating, “The dead do not praise the Lord, nor do any who go down into silence.” Job 7:9-10 also reinforces this idea, saying, “As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.” The dead do not return to their earthly homes, showing that death is a permanent, unconscious state. Psalm 146:3-4 declares, “When his breath departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish,” further stressing that the thoughts of the departed cease upon death.

3. The Resurrection and Awakening
All who have died, regardless of their moral standing, will be resurrected at the appointed time. Job 14:14 expresses the longing for this resurrection, “If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my service I would wait, till my renewal comes.” The dead will remain in the grave until the resurrection. John 5:28-29 affirms this, saying, “An hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.” This resurrection will occur at the second coming of Christ, and 1 Thessalonians 4:16 highlights, “For the Lord himself will descend from heaven… and the dead in Christ will rise first.” The righteous will be raised first, receiving a glorified, immortal body, as Paul explains in 1 Corinthians 15:42-44.

4. The Second Resurrection and the Wicked
The wicked will also be resurrected, but this will happen at the end of the millennium. Revelation 20:6 says, “Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power.” The wicked will be resurrected to face judgment and destruction. Revelation 20:9 describes the fate of the wicked, saying, “Fire came down from heaven and consumed them.” Revelation 20:4-5 further clarifies that the unrighteous will be resurrected at the close of the millennium, facing final judgment.

Notes
In conclusion, the condition of man in death is one of complete unconsciousness. However, the Bible promises that all will be awakened at the resurrection, either to eternal life or to judgment. This understanding provides comfort to believers and a warning to those who reject God’s ways.
