<h2>The Development of Church Organization</h2>

<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church did not come out of the 1844 movement with a structure and corporate identity. The scattered believers took nearly twenty years to develop the components that would finally bring about the need for a structured approach to fulfilling its mission. A few of these components, or steps, are listed below as we follow the move toward organization.</p>

<h3>Identity Cards Issued</h3>

<p>An initial step toward church organization was the need to identify those persons who, as itinerant preachers, would travel around the country preaching to small, scattered groups of believers who were often quite cut off from current happenings. It was decided that identification cards would be issued and signed by the “leading brethren,” thus certifying the validity of the doctrines presented by the carrier.</p>

<p>This procedure was introduced in <strong>1853</strong> (the forerunner of credentials). While the preachers received no salary and were thus self-supporting, they traveled and preached with zeal.</p>

<h3>Evangelistic Tents and Sabbath Schools</h3>

<p>During the summer of <strong>1853</strong>, Elders <strong>J. N. Loughborough</strong> and <strong>M. E. Cornell</strong> were sent out at the expense of the Battle Creek church to travel in three adjacent states. They became the first to have a “travel budget.”</p>

<p>The following summer, they raised the necessary <strong>$200</strong> to purchase a <strong>600-foot circular tent</strong>, and on <strong>June 10, 1854</strong>, held the first-ever tent meeting among Seventh-day Adventists. While these events may appear insignificant today, for a small and scattered group of believers, these were momentous and risky decisions with little support except faith.</p>

<p>The year <strong>1853</strong> also saw the development of an embryonic structure with the formation of regular <strong>Sabbath schools</strong> in <em>Rochester</em> and <em>Buck’s Bridge, New York</em>. The idea had been introduced the year before through a novel series of Sabbath school lessons printed in the new magazine <strong><em>The Youth’s Instructor</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>Move to Battle Creek</h2>

<p>The Whites had settled in <strong>Rochester, New York</strong>, where they had enough room to set up a small print shop to produce the magazines and pamphlets that were rapidly expanding the work of the gospel. However, the primary growth of the movement was following the westward expansion of the nation, and Rochester was getting left behind and out of the way.</p>

<p>The print shop was incorporated instead of being under private ownership. Then, four laymen offered <strong>James White</strong> <strong>$1,200</strong> as an interest-free loan to set up the press in <strong>Battle Creek</strong>. The offer was accepted, and in <strong>1855</strong>, the press moved to a two-story <strong>20 x 30-foot</strong> (6m x 9m) house in <strong>Michigan</strong>. Here, the fledgling church established its headquarters until <strong>1903</strong>, when it moved to <strong>Washington, D.C.</strong></p>

<p><em>(See <strong>Life Sketches of Ellen White</strong>, pp. 388-393, for interesting further details regarding this latter move.)</em></p>

<p>In the new location, the press was kept busy printing <strong>The Review and Herald</strong>, <strong>The Youth Instructor</strong>, temperance and evangelistic tracts, and an increasing load of various publications. <strong>Uriah Smith</strong>, who had joined the movement two years earlier, was appointed editor, and writers included <strong>Andrews, White, Waggoner, Cottrell, and Pierce</strong>.</p>

<p>The first issue (<em>Volume 7, Number 10</em>) of <strong>The Review</strong> in its new home was dated <strong>December 4, 1855</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>Early Publications</h3>

<p>In <strong>1849</strong>, a group of Sabbath-keeping Adventists began publishing a paper called <em>The Present Truth</em>. In <strong>1850</strong>, they also published six issues of <em>The Advent Review</em>. In November of that year, these two papers merged under the name <strong>Second Advent Review and Sabbath Herald</strong>, which today is simply the <strong>Adventist Review</strong>.</p>

<p>This general church paper contains news of church activities worldwide, along with devotional and doctrinal articles. There is both a weekly edition and a monthly edition. It is printed at the <strong>Review and Herald Publishing Association</strong> in <strong>Hagerstown, Maryland</strong>.</p>

<p><em>The Youth’s Instructor</em>, begun in <strong>1852</strong> by <strong>James White</strong>, has evolved into several age-related magazines to better meet the needs of young readers. Today, the church publishes <strong>Insight, Guide, Primary Treasure, Our Little Friend</strong>, and <strong>Sabbath School Lesson Quarterlies</strong> for all age groups.</p>

<h2>Opposition to Organization</h2>

<p><strong>At first</strong>, the mere mention of the word <em>"organization"</em> provoked strong feelings and vocal negative opinions. Many early believers had been disfellowshipped from their previous churches, which led to a strong resistance against any formal church structure.</p>

<p>However, as the movement grew in numbers and spread geographically, it became increasingly evident that <strong>church organization was essential</strong> to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Safeguard against confusion and fanaticism</li>
    <li>Prevent the movement from becoming a one-leader cult</li>
    <li>Ensure continuity and focus on its mission</li>
    <li>Resolve legal issues related to property ownership</li>
</ul>

<h2>Early Church Finance</h2>

<p>In the <strong>1850s</strong>, those who preached the Advent message relied on the generosity of their listeners and worked whenever and wherever they could to support themselves. A group, under the leadership of <strong>J. N. Andrews</strong>, searched the Scriptures to find <em>God’s method</em> for supporting the ministry.</p>

<p>The resulting recommendation was called <strong>systematic benevolence</strong>. The initial plan adopted required each member to give annually at least <strong>1% of all personal property</strong> free of debt, in addition to weekly free-will offerings.</p>

<p>Until <strong>1853</strong>, all literature was distributed for free and printed only when specific donations were received. However, in <strong>1853</strong>, <strong>James White</strong> suggested selling the tracts, with <strong>J. N. Loughborough</strong> setting the price of a full set at <strong>35 cents</strong>. By <strong>1854</strong>, the <em>Review</em> was offered by subscription at <strong>$1.00 per year</strong>, payable in advance.</p>

<h2>Vote to Organize</h2>

<p>To understand the setting, here’s a quote illustrating much of the current thought of the times:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>George Storrs, a prominent leader in the movement, wrote: <em>“Take care that you do not seek to organize another church. No church can be organized by man’s invention but what it becomes is Babylon the moment it is organized...”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When tent ministry became an effective way of spreading the gospel, it required a full-time commitment from a large number of ministers. This was not possible without some regular form of support. Finances were therefore carefully studied, and plans were voted.</p>

<p>Then some suggested that a form of organization was needed to hold church property. Opposition arose, and accusations such as <em>“going back to Babylon,” “union of church and state,” “power mongers,”</em> greed, and position were all used as the debate became more emotional rather than fact-based. However, reality slowly won out.</p>

<p>At a general meeting held at the end of <strong>September 1860</strong>, the name <strong>“Seventh-day Adventist”</strong> was selected to represent the movement, and a unanimous vote was taken for the formation of a publishing association. The <strong>Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association</strong> was officially formed on <strong>May 3, 1861</strong>.</p>

<p>At this spring meeting, it was also decided to issue <strong>certificates of ordination</strong>, and the churches in the state of Michigan were organized into a conference, with a chairman, secretary, and advisory board.</p>

<p><em>The Michigan Conference</em> then met the following year and invited all other state conferences to meet in a general conference in the spring of <strong>1863</strong>. Six states organized and sent delegates to the <strong>May 20-23</strong> meeting. At this meeting:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A <strong>General Conference constitution committee</strong> was appointed.</li>
    <li>A <strong>state conference constitution committee</strong> was named.</li>
    <li><strong>John Byington</strong> was elected as the first president.</li>
    <li>A constitution of <strong>nine articles</strong> was adopted.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this time, there were <strong>3,555 members</strong> in <strong>125 churches</strong>. The ordained ministerial staff numbered <strong>twenty-two</strong>, with <strong>eight additional licensed workers</strong>.</p>
