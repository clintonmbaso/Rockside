<h2>Two Purposes in One Manual</h2>
<p>This manual covers the information needed for the courses in 
            <strong>Church Heritage</strong> for the <strong>Master Guide</strong> and <strong>Senior Youth Leadership</strong>, in addition to serving as a reference source for pertinent requirements in the <strong>Pathfinder classes</strong>.</p>

<h3>Master Guide/Senior Youth Leadership</h3>
<p>Candidates need to study all sections in the Church Heritage course. The passages in the course that are underlined or marked with an asterisk (<strong>*</strong>) are of particular importance.</p>

<h3>Reference Books</h3>
<p>Although this manual covers all material in the examinations, some students will also want to refer to reference books. Many such books have been authored through the years and may be available. A partial listing of these follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The Great Advent Movement</strong> by Emma Howell Cooper</li>
    <li><strong>Light Bearers to the Remnant</strong> by Richard Schwarz</li>
    <li><strong>Origin and History of Seventh-day Adventists</strong> by Arthur W. Spalding</li>
    <li><strong>Tell It to the World</strong> by C. Mervyn Maxwell</li>
    <li><strong>Movement of Destiny</strong> by LeRoy Edwin Froom</li>
    <li><strong>Anticipating the Advent</strong> by George R. Knight</li>
    <li><strong>Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia</strong> (revised edition)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructors for this course should certainly secure at least one or more of these and study them carefully in preparation for teaching this course.</p>

<h2>For Instructors</h2>
<p>Church Heritage instructors should thoroughly master the subject before attempting to teach this important course.</p>

<p>In the introductory lessons, the teachers should give an overall view of Church Heritage, so that when members are studying the details, they can see how it relates to the whole course of Church Heritage.</p>

<p>Instructors should prepare <strong>charts</strong> depicting various phases of Church Heritage and also have <strong>maps</strong> available for students to locate places that are unknown to them.</p>

<p>Church Heritage should be an <em>interesting class</em> where the students receive <strong>inspiration</strong> as well as <strong>information</strong>. Do not simply “read the book” to the class members, pausing only to say, “Learn this.” Make the history come alive, and the students will be eager to learn.</p>
