<h2>General Principles</h2>
<p>The Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy set forth in clear, unmistakable 
language the solemn responsibility that rests upon the people of God to 
maintain their purity, integrity, and spiritual fervor. If members grow 
indifferent or drift away, the church must seek to reclaim them for the Lord.
            
<p>Dealing With Erring Members—“Moreover if your brother sins 
against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears 
you, you have gained your brother. But if he will not hear, take with you one 
or two more, that ‘by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be 
established.’ And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he 
refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax 
collector. Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound 
in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven” (Matt.
18:15-18).
<p>“In dealing with erring church members, God’s people are carefully to 
follow the instruction given by the Savior in the eighteenth chapter of 
Matthew.
<p>“Human beings are Christ’s property, purchased by Him at an infinite 
price, bound to Him by the love that He and His Father have manifested for 
them. How careful, then, we should be in our dealing with one another! Men 
have no right to surmise evil in regard to their fellow men. Church members 
have no right to follow their own impulses and inclinations in dealing with 
fellow members who have erred. They should not even express their 
prejudices regarding the erring, for thus they place in other minds the leaven 
of evil. . . .
<p>“ ‘If thy brother shall trespass against thee,’ Christ declared, ‘go and tell 
him his fault between thee and him alone.’ . . . Do not tell others of the wrong. 
One person is told, then another, and still another; and continually the report 
grows, and the evil increases, till the whole church is made to suffer. Settle 
the matter ‘between thee and him alone.’ This is God’s plan.”—7T 260.
<p>God’s Plan—“Whatever the character of the offense, this does not 
change the plan that God has made for the settlement of misunderstandings 
and personal injuries. Speaking alone and in the spirit of Christ to the one 
who is in fault will often remove the difficulty. Go to the erring one, with a
heart filled with Christ’s love and sympathy, and seek to adjust the matter. 
Reason with him calmly and quietly. Let no angry words escape your lips. 
Speak in a way that will appeal to his better judgment. Remember the words: 
‘He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul 
from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.’ James 5:20. . . .
<p>“All heaven is interested in the interview between the one who has been 
injured and the one who is in error. As the erring one accepts the reproof 
offered in the love of Christ, and acknowledges his wrong, asking forgiveness 
from God and from his brother, the sunshine of heaven fills his heart. . . . The 
Spirit of God binds heart to heart, and there is music in heaven over the union 
brought about. . . .
<p>“ ‘But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that 
in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.’. . . 
Take with you those who are spiritually minded, and talk with the one in error 
in regard to the wrong. . . . As he sees their agreement in the matter, his mind 
may be enlightened.
<p>“ ‘And if he shall neglect to hear them,’ what then shall be done? Shall 
a few persons in a board meeting take upon themselves the responsibility of 
disfellowshiping the erring one? ‘If he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto 
the church.’ . . . Let the church take action in regard to its members.
<p>“ ‘But if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen 
man and a publican.’ . . . If he will not heed the voice of the church, if he 
refuses all the efforts made to reclaim him, upon the church rests the 
responsibility of separating him from fellowship. His name should then be 
stricken from the books.
<p>“No church officer should advise, no committee should recommend, nor 
should any church vote, that the name of a wrongdoer shall be removed from 
the church books, until the instruction given by Christ has been faithfully 
followed. When this instruction has been followed, the church has cleared 
herself before God. The evil must then be made to appear as it is, and must 
be removed, that it may not become more and more widespread. The health 
and purity of the church must be preserved, that she may stand before God 
unsullied, clad in the robes of Christ’s righteousness. . . .
<p>“ ‘Verily I say unto you,’ Christ continued, ‘whatsoever ye shall bind on 
earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall 
be loosed in heaven.’ . . .
<p>“This statement holds its force in all ages. On the church has been 
conferred the power to act in Christ’s stead. It is God’s instrumentality for 
the preservation of order and discipline among His people. To it the Lord has 
delegated the power to settle all questions respecting its prosperity, purity, 
and order. Upon it rests the responsibility of excluding from its fellowship 
those who are unworthy, who by their un-Christlike conduct would bring 
dishonor on the truth. Whatever the church does that is in accordance with 
the directions given in God’s Word will be ratified in heaven.”—7T 261-263.
<p>Authority of the Church—“The world’s Redeemer has invested great 
power with His church. He states the rules to be applied in cases of trial with 
its members. After He has given explicit directions as to the course to be 
pursued, He says: ‘Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth 
shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever [in church discipline] ye shall loose 
on earth shall be loosed in heaven.’ Thus even the heavenly authority ratifies 
the discipline of the church in regard to its members when the Bible rule has 
been followed.
<p>“The Word of God does not give license for one man to set up his 
judgment in opposition to the judgment of the church, neither is he allowed 
to urge his opinions against the opinions of the church.”—3T 428.
<p>Church’s Responsibility—“God holds His people, as a body, 
responsible for the sins existing in individuals among them. If the leaders of 
the church neglect to diligently search out the sins which bring the displeasure 
of God upon the body, they become responsible for these sins.”—3T 269.
<p>“If there were no church discipline and government, the church would 
go to fragments; it could not hold together as a body.”—3T 428.
<p>Unconsecrated Resist Discipline—“There are many who do not have 
the discretion of Joshua and who have no special duty to search out wrongs 
and to deal promptly with the sins existing among them. Let not such hinder 
those who have the burden of this work upon them; let them not stand in the 
way of those who have this duty to do. Some make it a point to question and 
doubt and find fault because others do the work that God has not laid upon 
them. These stand directly in the way to hinder those upon whom God has 
laid the burden of reproving and correcting prevailing sins in order that His 
frown may be turned away from His people. Should a case like Achan’s be 
among us, there are many who would accuse those who might act the part of 
Joshua in searching out the wrong, of having a wicked, fault-finding spirit. 
God is not to be trifled with and His warnings disregarded with impunity by 
a perverse people. . . .
<p>“Those who work in the fear of God to rid the church of hindrances and 
to correct grievous wrongs, that the people of God may see the necessity of 
abhorring sin and may prosper in purity, and that the name of God may be 
glorified, will ever meet with resisting influences from the unconsecrated.”—
3T 270, 271.
<p>Safeguarding Unity of the Church—Christians should make every 
effort to avoid tendencies that would divide them and bring dishonor to their 
cause. “It is the purpose of God that His children shall blend in unity. Do they 
not expect to live together in the same heaven? . . . Those who refuse to work 
in harmony greatly dishonor God.”—8T 240. The church should discourage 
actions that threaten harmony among its members and should consistently 
encourage unity.
<p>Although all members have equal rights within the church, no individual 
member or group should start a movement or form an organization or seek to 
encourage a following for the attainment of any objective or for the teaching 
of any doctrine or message not in harmony with the fundamental religious 
objectives and teachings of the Church. Such a course would result in the 
fostering of a divisive spirit, the fragmenting of the witness of the Church, 
and thus in hindering of the Church’s discharge of its obligations to the Lord 
and the world.
<p>Reconciliation of Differences—Every effort should be made to settle 
differences among church members and contain the controversy within the 
smallest possible sphere. Reconciliation of differences within the church 
should, in most cases, be possible without recourse either to a conciliation 
process provided by the Church or to civil litigation.
<p>“If matters of difficulty between brethren were not laid open before 
others, but frankly spoken of between themselves in the spirit of Christian 
love, how much evil might be prevented! How many roots of bitterness 
whereby many are defiled would be destroyed, and how closely and tenderly 
might the followers of Christ be united in His love!”—TMB 59. (See p. 64.)
<p>“Contentions, strife, and lawsuits between brethren are a disgrace to the 
cause of truth. Those who take such a course expose the church to the ridicule 
of her enemies and cause the powers of darkness to triumph. They are 
piercing the wounds of Christ afresh and putting Him to an open shame. By 
ignoring the authority of the church they show contempt for God, who gave 
to the church its authority.”—5T 242, 243.
<p>Civil litigation is often carried on in a spirit of contention that results 
from and reveals human selfishness. It is this kind of adversarial proceedings 
that must be discouraged by a church that seeks to exhibit the spirit of Christ. 
Christian unselfishness will lead followers of Christ to suffer themselves to 
be defrauded (1 Cor. 6:7) rather than to “go to law before the unrighteous, 
and not before the saints” (1 Cor. 6:1).
<p>While there are, in the modern world, occasions for seeking decrees of 
civil courts, Christians should prefer settlement within the authority of the 
Church and should limit the seeking of such decrees to cases that are clearly 
within the jurisdiction of the civil courts and not within the authority of the 
Church or for which the Church agrees it has no adequate process for orderly 
settlement. Such suits before civil courts should never become revengeful 
adversary proceedings but should develop out of a desire to seek arbitration 
and to settle differences amicably.
<p>Examples of such civil cases may include, but are not limited to, the 
settlement of insurance claims, the issuance of decrees affecting the 
boundaries and ownership of real property, the deciding of some matters 
involving the administration of estates, and the awarding of custody of minor 
children.
<p>While the Church should set up procedures within the constraints of legal 
practice to avoid the type of litigation referred to in 1 Corinthians 6, it should 
constantly be on guard against turning from its gospel mission and taking up 
the duties of a civil magistrate. (See Luke 12:13, 14 and 9T 216-218.)
<p>God’s ideal for members of His Church is that they should, as far as 
possible, “live peaceably with all men” (Rom. 12:18). The Church should use 
its readily accessible and reasonably prompt process by which many 
differences among members can be settled. Should the Church fail to respond 
to a request for help in reconciling a difference, or if the Church 
acknowledges that the nature of the case is such that it is not within its 
authority, it should be recognized that the member has exhausted the 
possibilities of the biblically outlined procedure for the settlement of 
differences and that what he/she should do beyond that point is a matter for 
his/her conscience. (See The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 698.)
<p>However, when the Church, endeavoring to assist in timely and amicable 
settlement of differences among its members, recommends a solution, 
members should not summarily reject the recommendation. As 1 Corinthians
6:7 indicates, it is no light matter for a member, outside the orderly processes 
of the Church, to litigate a grievance against another member.
<p>Members who demonstrate impatience and selfishness by their 
unwillingness to wait for and accept recommendations of the Church in the 
settlement of grievances against other church members may properly be 
subject to the discipline of the church (See pp. 63-64.) because of the 
disruptive effect on the Church and their refusal to recognize properly 
constituted Church authority
Settlement of Grievances of Members Against the Church—The 
same principles that influence resolution of differences among members 
apply to the settlement of grievances of members against Church 
organizations and institutions.
<p>Members should not instigate litigation against any Church entity except 
under circumstances where the Church has not provided adequate process for 
orderly settlement of the grievance or where the nature of the case is such that 
it is clearly not within the authority of the Church to settle.
<p>Settlement of Grievances of the Church Against Members—At 
times Church organizations or institutions may have grievances against 
members. In such circumstances, Church administrators must, in Christian 
forbearance, keep in mind the biblical counsel for settling disputes among 
Christians and apply that counsel to the settlement of grievances of the 
Church against its members. The Church should, in preference to litigating 
matters in a secular court, make every reasonable effort in cooperation with 
the member to provide a process by which orderly settlement of the problem 
can be accomplished.
<p>The Church recognizes the need of exercising great care to protect the 
highest spiritual interests of its members, to ensure fair treatment, and to 
safeguard the name of the Church. It cannot afford to deal lightly with such 
sins or permit personal considerations to affect its actions, and at the same 
time it must strive to reclaim and restore those who err.
<p>“If the erring one repents and submits to Christ’s discipline, he is to be 
given another trial. And even if he does not repent, even if he stands outside 
the church, God’s servants still have a work to do for him. They are to seek 
earnestly to win him to repentance. And, however aggravated may have been 
his offense, if he yields to the striving of the Holy Spirit and, by confessing 
and forsaking his sin, gives evidence of repentance, he is to be forgiven and 
welcomed to the fold again. His brethren are to encourage him in the right 
way, treating him as they would wish to be treated were they in his place, 
considering themselves lest they also be tempted.”—7T 263.

<h2>Reasons for Discipline</h2>
<p>The reasons for which members shall be subject to discipline are:
<p>1. Denial of faith in the fundamentals of the gospel and in the 
Fundamental Beliefs of the Church or teaching doctrines contrary to the 
same.
            
<p>2. Violation of the law of God, such as worship of idols, murder, 
stealing, profanity, gambling, Sabbathbreaking, and willful and habitual 
falsehood.
            
<p>3. Violation of the commandment of the law of God, which reads, 
“You shall not commit adultery” (Ex. 20:14, Matt. 5:27-28), as it relates to 
the marriage institution and the Christian home, biblical standards of moral 
conduct, and any act of sexual intimacy outside of a marriage relationship 
and/or non-consensual acts of sexual conduct within a marriage, whether 
those acts are legal or illegal. Such acts include but are not limited to child 
sexual abuse, including abuse of the vulnerable. Marriage is defined as a 
public, lawfully binding, monogamous, heterosexual relationship between 
one man and one woman.
            
<p>4. Fornication, which includes among other issues, promiscuity, 
homosexual activity, incest, sodomy, and bestiality.
            
<p>5. The production, use, or distribution of pornographic material.
            
<p>6. Remarriage of a divorced person, except the spouse who has 
remained faithful to the marriage vow in a divorce for adultery or for sexual 
perversions.
            
<p>7. Physical violence, including violence within the family.
            
<p>8. Fraud or willful misrepresentation in business.
            
<p>9. Disorderly conduct which brings reproach upon the church.
<p>10. Adherence to or taking part in a divisive or disloyal movement or 
organization. (See pp. 63-64.)
<p>11. Persistent refusal to recognize properly constituted church authority 
or to submit to the order and discipline of the church.
<p>12. The use, manufacture, or sale of alcoholic beverages.
<p>13. The use, manufacture, or sale of tobacco in any of its forms for 
human consumption.
<p>14. The use or manufacture of illicit drugs or the use, misuse, or sale of 
narcotics or drugs without appropriate medical cause and license.

<h2>Process of Discipline</h2>
<p>When grievous sins are involved, the church has two ways in which 
disciplinary measures must be taken:
<p>1. By a vote of censure.
<p>2. By a vote to remove from membership.
<p>Discipline by Censure—In cases where the offense is not considered 
by the church to be so serious as to warrant the extreme course of removing 
membership, the church may express its disapproval by a vote of censure.
Censure has two purposes: 
<p>(1) To enable the church to express its 
disapproval of a grievous offense that has brought disgrace upon the cause of 
God and 
<p>(2) to impress offending members with the need for a change of life
and reformation of conduct and to give them a period of grace and probation 
during which to make those changes.
<p>A vote of censure is for a stated period of from a minimum of one month 
to a maximum of 12 months. It terminates an erring member’s election or 
appointment to all offices and removes the privilege of election while it is in 
effect. Members under censure have no right to participate by voice or by 
vote in the affairs of the church or lead church activities, such as teaching a 
Sabbath School class. They are not deprived, however, of the privilege of 
sharing the blessings of Sabbath School, church worship, or communion. 
<p>Membership may not be transferred during the period of censure.
Votes of censure must not carry any provision involving removal of 
membership in case of failure to comply with any condition imposed. 
Assessment should be made at the expiration of the period of censure to 
determine whether the disciplined members have changed course. If their 
conduct is satisfactory, they may then be considered in regular standing 
without further action and shall be notified that the censure has ended. If their 
conduct is not satisfactory, the church again should consider appropriate 
discipline. Any return to church office must be by election.
<p>Discipline by Removal From Membership—Removing individuals 
from membership in the church, the body of Christ, is the ultimate discipline 
that the church can administer. Only after the instruction given in this chapter 
has been followed, after counsel from the pastor or the conference when the 
pastor is unavailable, and after all possible efforts have been made to win and 
restore them to right paths, should an individual be removed from 
membership.
<p>No Additional Tests of Membership—The authority to establish tests 
of membership rests with the General Conference Session. Anyone seeking 
to apply tests other than those herein set forth does not, therefore, properly 
represent the Church. (See 1T 207.)
<p>Timeliness of Discipline—The church must care for the disciplinary 
process within a reasonable time and then communicate its decisions with 
kindness and promptness. Delay in administering discipline may increase the 
frustration and suffering of the member and the church itself.
<p>Caution About Judging Character and Motive—“Christ has plainly 
taught that those who persist in open sin must be separated from the church,
but He has not committed to us the work of judging character and motive. He 
knows our nature too well to entrust this work to us. Should we try to uproot 
from the church those whom we suppose to be spurious Christians, we should 
be sure to make mistakes. Often we regard as hopeless subjects the very ones 
whom Christ is drawing to Himself. Were we to deal with these souls 
according to our imperfect judgment, it would perhaps extinguish their last 
hope. Many who think themselves Christians will at last be found wanting. 
<p>Many will be in heaven who their neighbors supposed would never enter 
there. Man judges from appearance, but God judges the heart. The tares and 
the wheat are to grow together until the harvest; and the harvest is the end of 
probationary time. There is in the Savior’s words another lesson, a lesson of 
wonderful forbearance and tender love. As the tares have their roots closely 
intertwined with those of the good grain, so false brethren in the church may 
be closely linked with true disciples. The real character of these pretended 
believers is not fully manifested. Were they to be separated from the church, 
others might be caused to stumble, who but for this would have remained 
steadfast.”—COL 71, 72.
<p>At a Properly Called Meeting—Members may be disciplined for 
sufficient cause, but only at a properly called business meeting (see p. 135) 
after the church board has reviewed the case. The meeting must be presided 
over by an ordained pastor, or licensed pastor who is ordained as a local elder 
of the church concerned, or, in the pastor’s absence and in counsel with the 
pastor or with the conference president, an elder of the local church.
<p>By Majority Vote—Members may be removed from membership or 
otherwise disciplined only by a majority vote of members present and voting 
at a duly called meeting. “The majority of the church is a power which should 
control its individual members.”—5T 107.
            
<p>Church Board Cannot Remove Members—The board may 
recommend to a business meeting the removal of members, but under no 
circumstance does the board have the right to take final action, except to 
record removal at death or at the member’s request. (See pp. 61, 72, 87.)
<p>Fundamental Rights of the Members—Members have a fundamental 
right to prior notification of the disciplinary meetings (See p. 134.) and the 
right to be heard in their own defense, introduce evidence, and produce 
witnesses. No church should vote to discipline a member under 
circumstances that deprive the member of these rights. Written notice must 
be given at least two weeks before the church board meeting and two weeks 
before the business meeting and include the reasons for the disciplinary 
hearing.
            
<p>Lawyers Not to Represent Members—The work of the Church in its 
administration of order and discipline is an ecclesiastical function that in no 
sense has to do with civil or legal procedure. Therefore, the Church does not 
recognize the right of members to bring legal counsel to represent them in 
any meeting called to administer order or discipline or for the transaction of 
any other church business. Members wanting to bring legal counsel into a 
meeting should be informed that they will not be given a hearing if they insist 
on bringing legal counsel.
            
<p>The church also should exclude all nonmembers from any church 
meeting called for the administration of church order or discipline, except 
when they are called as witnesses.
            
<p>Transferring Members Under Censure—No church shall receive 
into membership persons who are under censure of another congregation, 
because that would condone the offenses for which the members have been 
disciplined. The acceptance into membership of those under discipline is such 
a serious violation of Church policy that an offending church may be subject 
to discipline by the conference constituency.
            
<p>Members Not to Be Removed for Nonattendance—Church leaders 
should faithfully visit absentee members and encourage them to resume 
attendance and to enjoy the blessings of worship with the congregation.
When because of age, infirmity, or other unavoidable cause members 
find it impossible to attend worship services regularly, they should keep in 
contact with church leaders by letter or other means. However, as long as 
members are loyal to the doctrines of the Church, nonattendance shall not be 
considered sufficient cause for removal from membership.
            
<p>Members Moving Away and Not Reporting—When members move, 
they should inform the clerk or elder of their new address. While remaining 
members of that church, they should report and send their tithe and offerings 
at least quarterly. If, however, members move without leaving a forwarding 
address and make no effort to contact or report to the church, and the church 
cannot locate them for at least two years, then the church may certify that it 
has tried without success to locate the members and the members may be 
removed by a vote of the church. The clerk should record in the membership 
record: “Whereabouts unknown. Voted to designate as missing.”
<p>Members Not to Be Removed for Pecuniary Reasons—Though 
members should support the work of the Church to the extent they are able, 
they should never be removed because of their inability or failure to 
contribute financially to the Church.
Removing Members at Their Request—Great care should be 
exercised in dealing with members who request to be removed from
membership. 
<p>The Church recognizes the right of the individual to withdraw 
membership. Letters of resignation shall be presented to the board, where the 
resignation will be recorded with the effective date according to the 
resignation letter. Out of Christian consideration for the individuals involved, 
action shall be taken without public discussion. Efforts should be made to 
restore the individual to the church family.
<p>Notification to Those Removed From Membership—A church 
removing members must notify them in writing of the action taken but with 
the assurance of enduring spiritual interest and personal concern. This 
communication should, where possible, be delivered in person by the pastor 
or by a board designee. The former members should be assured that the 
church hopes they will return to the church and that one day there will be 
eternal fellowship together in the kingdom of God.
<p>Reinstating Those Previously Removed From Membership—
When persons have been removed for discipline, the church should, where 
possible, maintain contact and manifest the spirit of friendship and love, 
endeavoring to bring them back to the Lord.
<p>Those previously removed may be received again into membership when 
confession of wrongs committed is made, evidence is given of real repentance 
and change of life, and the life is consistent with Church standards and it is 
clear that the member will fully submit to Church order and discipline. Such 
reinstatement should preferably be in the church from which the member was 
dismissed. However, when this is not possible, the church where the person 
is requesting reinstatement must seek information from the former church 
about the reasons for which the person was removed from membership.
<p>When dealing with perpetrators of sexual abuse, it should be 
remembered that restoration to membership does not remove all 
consequences of such a serious violation. While attendance at church 
activities may be permissible with properly established guidelines, a person 
convicted or disciplined for sexual abuse should not be placed in a role which 
could put them in contact with children, youth, and other vulnerable 
individuals. Neither shall they be given any position which would encourage 
vulnerable individuals to trust them implicitly.
<p>Because removal from membership is the most serious form of 
discipline, the period of time before members may be reinstated should be 
sufficient to demonstrate that the issues which led to removal from 
membership have been resolved beyond reasonable doubt. It is expected that 
readmission to membership will be done in connection with rebaptism.
<p>Right of Appeal for Reinstatement—While it is the right of the 
church to administer discipline, this does not set aside the rights of members 
to seek fairness. If members believe that they have been treated unfairly by 
the local church, or not had the right to be heard fairly, and the church is 
unwilling to reconsider the case or if the officers refuse to consider their 
applications for reinstatement, the former members have a right to appeal in 
writing to the church for a hearing. The church should not neglect or refuse 
to grant such hearings. If it does, or if the former members still feel unfairly 
treated by the church after the appeal, they have the right to a final appeal for 
a hearing to the executive committee of the conference.
<p>If, after a full and impartial hearing, the conference executive committee 
is satisfied that an injustice has been inflicted by the church, the committee 
may recommend reinstatement to membership. But if membership is still 
refused by the church, then the conference executive committee may 
recommend membership in some other church. On the other hand, if it finds 
good grounds for sustaining the church in refusing to reinstate the former 
members, it will so record its decision.
