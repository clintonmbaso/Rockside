    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Club Ministries Training (CMT) is a curriculum framework that provides in-depth training for club staff in specific roles. The certifications are designed to be completed within one year, and are meant to equip leaders of all varieties for the ministries in which they serve. They are not levels of Investiture Achievement such as Sunbeam, Friend, or Guide, but rather opportunities for individuals to learn more about being an effective director, instructor, counselor, etc. Certifications are earned by attending workshops, working with a mentor, doing fieldwork, and preparing a documentation Portfolio.</p>

    <h4>Enhancing Transparency and Accountability</h4>

    <p>The role of secretaries and treasurers in any youth ministry is multifaceted. A report page offers them a structured platform to document meeting minutes, financial summaries, and membership updates. This not only enhances transparency within the ministry but also ensures accountability in resource management and decision-making processes.</p>
    <p>CMT is based on the Adventist Youth Ministry Training (AYMT) certifications, developed by the North American Division.</p>
  
    <h4>Optional</h4>
    <p>For Divisions that would like to recognize leaders that achieve these certifications, a pin with the achieved certification could be included in the official sash.
    <p>Shops, the participant is eligible to receive an enameled pin and certificate of completion.</p>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>CMT certifications are replacing the Pathfinder Leadership Award (PLA) and Advanced Pathfinder Leadership Award (APLA)/Pathfinder Instructor Award (PIA).</li>
        <li>Receiving a CMT pin is not considered investiture, but rather, awarding of a certificate. The highest investiture in Club Ministries continues to be Master Guide.</li>
        <li>CMT certifications are connected to a club role or position, meaning that there is no point to achieve them all unless you are the only leader in a club. CMT certifications are intended for all members of a team.</li>
      </ol>

 <h3>Workshop Content</h3>
    <h4>Club Ministries and Purposes</h4>
       <p>This workshop is about understanding how club ministries work to grow a child in Christ and keep them connected to the church. The focus of this training is Pathfinders.</p>

         <li>Master Guide Ministries includes adults from age 18 and above. The focus of this ministry is to train adults for leadership in Adventurer, Pathfinder, Youth, and Young Adult ministries for nurture and outreach for Jesus Christ.</li>
       </ul>
       
    <h4>Pathfinder Club Ministry and Staff Roles</h4>
       <p>Review the philosophy, objectives and goals of Pathfinder club ministry. The strength and effectiveness of Pathfinder club ministry is directly proportional to the influence of the staff. How staff model the Pathfinder Pledge and Law, and their facilitation of the Pathfinder mission and goals will determine the strength of their club ministry.</p>

     <h4>Pathfinder Club Philosophy</h4>
       <p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church is committed to understanding young people and training its youth for leadership and service to humanity.</p>
       <p>The Pathfinder Club is a church-centered spiritual-recreational-activity program designed for young people 10 to 15 years of age. Pathfindering appeals to this age group because its program features activities that meet their needs and interests. Much of the Pathfinder Club program is built around physical action. This is because youth from 10 to 15 years of age are in a fast-growing physical stage of development. It is filled with action, adventure, challenge, group activities, and provides opportunities for the development of new attitudes and skills that produce personal growth, team or community spirit and a sense of loyalty and respect for God, His creation, and His church.</p>
       <p>While the Pathfinder Club exists primarily for youth, one of its basic purposes is to also bring together parents and church members through active involvement with the club and its members. Here the so-called generation gap disappears as young and old worship, work, and play together in a bond of common experience. Meaningful relationships are forged as leaders and counselors join with Pathfinders in sharing, building confidence, and working together.</p>
       <p>The whole philosophy of Pathfindering is built on the premise that “children learn best by example, rather than by precept.” As they see leaders and parents model spiritual and social values, they too will aspire to develop high moral principles, loving and caring attitudes, and determination to excel in all their various pursuits.</p>
       <p>Young people learn most effectively in a positive, happy, and secure atmosphere. The attitude of the club leaders is therefore a vital ingredient in guaranteeing the success and effectiveness of this ministry to youth. A failure to listen to and to understand the needs of the young people will erect barriers to real spiritual growth and development and may prove to be a contributing factor in making the church and its mission unattractive to the youth.</p>

    <h4>Objectives</h4>
       <ol>
         <li>Help the young people to understand that God and His church love them, care for them, and appreciate them. As Pathfinders are accepted and affirmed, they will appreciate the love of God revealed through the church and its ministry, and feel a need to be more committed to and involved with its program.</li>
         <li>Encourage Pathfinders to discover their own God-given potential and to use their gifts and abilities to fulfill God’s expectations for them and the part they can play in the great plan of salvation.</li>
         <li>Inspire young people to give personal expression of their love for God by uniting them together in various outreach activities.</li>
         <li>Make the number one priority of your club program the personal salvation of every Pathfinder. The Pathfinder age is a time when many decisions are being made that will affect the youth’s future relationships and his or her own personal development. The peak time for discovering and making a relationship with God appears to be around 12 years of age.</li>
         <li>Build into a Pathfinder’s life a healthy appreciation and love for God’s creation by enjoying outdoor activity (campouts, nature walks, nature honors, etc.). Pathfinders will be encouraged to experience a sense of wonder and worship as they observe and explore the beauty, the majesty, and the creative power in nature. Fellowship with God becoming more meaningful.</li>
       </ol>

    <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
       <p>Pathfinder Ministry is an organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, dedicated to meeting the mental, physical, social and spiritual developmental needs of youth ages 10-15 by challenging the Pathfinder to experience a personal relationship with Christ, have a sense of achievement and responsibility, develop respect for God’s creation, and care for each member of God’s family.</p>

    <h4>Goals</h4>
       <p>Pathfinder Ministries seeks to meet the Pathfinder’s present and unfolding needs, to the end that we bring them to self-fulfillment and maturity in Christian faith, characterized by their decision to:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Accept Jesus Christ as a personal Savior and Lord</li>
         <li>Reflect internalized Christian values through mature decision making and behavior</li>
         <li>Exhibit the righteousness, true holiness, and fullness of stature of Christ</li>
         <li>Demonstrate leadership skills, enabled and empowered to become full partners in active, selfless service supporting the mission of the church</li>
       </ul>
       
    <h4>Goals</h4>
       <p>Pathfinder Ministries seeks to meet the Pathfinder’s present and unfolding needs, to the end that we bring them to self-fulfillment and maturity in Christian faith, characterized by their decision to:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Facilitate a group discussion of specific ways staff can meet the goals and objectives of Pathfinder club ministry. Look specifically at the verbs (action words) in the goals and objectives.</li>
         <li>Give time for participants to write at least three ways they plan to personally emulate the Pathfinder club ministry goals to their Pathfinders.</li>
       </ul>

         <li>Learn the components of a club merit system and how it is used to determine awards</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h4>Workshop Content</h4>
       <h5>Introduction to Club Organization</h5>
       <ul>
         <li>Give each participant a handout based on the local Conference guidelines on how to start or re-start a Pathfinder Club.</li>
         <li>Encourage participants to meet with their pastor, conference Pathfinder director, and Pathfinder area coordinator on a regular basis for guidance and direction as they begin building their church’s Pathfinder club ministry. Get Church Board Approval to Start a Pathfinder Club Ministry.</li>
         <li>Because having a Pathfinder Club is an outreach ministry of your local church, it is required that your church board approves it with recorded actions in the board minutes.</li>
         <li>Work with your pastor and put together a proposal to present to your church board.</li>
         <li>Get signatures from church board members as needed to obtain a Certificate of Operation from your conference Pathfinder office and mail or fax the completed form to your conference office.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h5>Gather Your Club Leadership Team</h5>
       <ul>
         <li>Get the support of your pastor and the church board, and recruit church members to become active as staff. Share the need, vision, and enthusiasm of what a Pathfinder club ministry can do for your youth and the larger community around your church.</li>
         <li>Ask your area coordinator to join you for staff organization meetings to help teach the fundamentals of Pathfinder club ministry and to build the vision of your staff.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h5>Recruit Pathfinders</h5>
       <ul>
         <li>Announce Pathfinder club ministry during the worship service. The church congregation can give support and enthusiasm for this ministry as you begin organizing.</li>
         <li>You and your staff should talk with potential Pathfinders and their parents. Tell them what Pathfinder club ministry is and the club’s plans for the year.</li>
         <li>Gather names of individuals in your church who can support the club by sponsoring a uniform for a Pathfinder, instructing a specific honor, and helping with fundraising, etc.</li>
         <li>Give participants the forms needed to register their clubs with the conference. Let them know what specific guidelines the conference has for Pathfinder club ministry.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h5>Staff Organization and Tasks</h5>
       <p>Pathfinder leaders are volunteers who receive no pay for their service to the church. In many cases, those who volunteer to be leaders are highly committed to Christian ideals. This is the way it should be, since the Pathfinder leader often plays a larger part in providing a Christian role model to young people than any other person in the church.</p>       
       
       <h5>Activity</h5>
       <p>Review the flow charts in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual. Give each participant time to draw the flow chart for their club including the specific names of individuals in each position.</p>
       
       <h5>Staff Training and Approval</h5>
       <p>To understand Pathfinder club ministry, all staff should undergo basic training to help them minister to Pathfinders. To continue effective ministry, continuing education is available.</p>
       <p>Because of the significant influence and responsibility that Pathfinder staff are given by parents, as well as church leaders, all volunteers working with minors must be approved by their conference prior to participating in Pathfinder club ministry. Let participants know what is required for volunteer approval in their conference.</p>         
       
       <h5>Club Leadership Team</h5>
       <p>The Pathfinder Club leadership team consists of a director, at least one deputy director, unit counselors and instructors, and a secretary and treasurer. These are the primary roles and each of them have specific tasks as organized by the club director.</p>
       <p>Review the qualities of a good leader (Pathfinder Administrative Manual).</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Love God supremely</li>
       <li>Love children sincerely</li>

       <li>Have a sense of humor</li>
       <li>Be resourceful and creative</li>
       </ul>
       
   <h5>Activity</h5>
       <p>Review duties of specific club staff positions. (Pathfinder Administrative Manual)</p>      
       <p>If a participant has not been designated a specific role in his/her club, encourage that person to identify a role of interest and discuss it with the club director.</p>

       <h5>Sample Weekly Club Meeting Outline</h5>
       <p>Demonstrate opening ceremonies with your participants.</p>
       
       <h5>Club Budget and Uniforms</h5>
       <p>Club Budget (Pathfinder Administrative Manual) - Every successful Pathfinder club operates within a financial budget. There are common components to a club budget. The finances that flow through the Pathfinder club are managed by the club treasurer in cooperation with the church treasurer. It is important for staff to be aware of how their club’s finances work</p>
       
       <h5>Activity</h5>
       <p>Review the sample budgets in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual as well as possible sources of income. It is imperative that clubs operate with fiscal responsibility. Expenses should never exceed income.</p>
       
       <h5>Uniforms</h5>
       <p>Review the purpose of the uniform and when it should and should not be worn.</p>     
       <p>Review the uniform standards under the www.gcyouthministries.org website.</p>
       <p>Review specific uniform standards for your local conference.</p>
       <p>Calculate the cost for a uniform for a Pathfinder and an adult, including items specific to your conference.</p>
       <p>Uniforms can have a major impact on a club budget. Each club should have a good plan for how they will manage uniform costs.</p>
       <p>Clubs have options when considering uniform expenses. They may require parents to purchase the uniform, the club may purchase the uniforms and operate an exchange or rental program, or the club may purchase certain pieces requiring the parents to purchase the remaining items. Clubs may also find sponsors willing to cover the cost of a uniform for a Pathfinder.</p>        

       <h5>Merit System and Awards</h5>
       <p>A club merit system provides a club a process for fairly awarding their Pathfinders in participation, progress, and development. Good Conduct Award and Pathfinder of the Year Awards have requirements that are met by using the club’s merit system. Use the Pathfinder Administrative Manual for each section below:</p>
       
       <h5>Merit System and Points</h5>
       <p>Each Pathfinder Club should have a Merit System for their Pathfinder Club and develop their own Merit System point values which are agreed upon by all Staff members and understood by all Pathfinders and parents. The club’s Merit System will help Staff to fairly determine awards to be given to their Pathfinders throughout the Pathfinder year. Simplicity is the key to a good merit system. Review the guidelines in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual.</p>
              
       <h5>Good Conduct Award & Pathfinder of the Year Award</h5>
       <p>The Club’s Investiture service is the place to reward club members for completing AY Investiture Achievement levels, honors, and special awards such as the Good Conduct Award and the Pathfinder of the Year Award.</p>
       
       <h5>Activity</h5>
       <p>Give each participant the guidelines for these awards from the Pathfinder Administrative Manual. Also include any guidelines and/or forms needed by the local conference office.</p>

Workshop Content
Club Mission, Goals, and Planning
The purpose of the Pathfinder club is to introduce young people to Jesus Christ and to 
help them grow in Him. The Pathfinder club 
program will help them develop their body, 
mind and spirit. With these skills, our young 
people are able to carry on the work of the 
church and bring others to the feet of Jesus. 
More than just skills, we want young people 
to build a relationship with Christ as their 
Lord and Savior, thus giving them the relational experience with Jesus that they need 
to lead their friends to know Him too.
       
Review the Pathfinder mission statement and goals. 
       Discuss how these are important 
to keep in mind when planning club meetings and activities.
Building a Club Calendar
It is challenging to develop the Pathfinder 
club yearly calendar. It takes time and effort 
to gather all the planning details and people 
together to make a plan, but it must be done 
if your club is going to succeed. Know that 
your club’s calendar planning is crucial for 
the success of your club.
       
When planning your club’s calendar, begin by 
gathering other calendars that you will need 
to coordinate with. These include church 
school and conference calendars. Distribute 
a copy of the Conference Pathfinder newsletter and review the yearly calendar specifying 
the events that are mandatory and those that 
are optional. Handout—Calendar of Conference Events. 
Once you have gathered all necessary information, begin to set your meeting schedule, what day of the week you will meet at 
what time. Some clubs meet every week, and 
some meet twice a month. Determine what 
schedule works for your club. Once you know 
your weekly schedule, begin planning major 
programs such as Induction, Pathfinder Sabbath, club campouts, fundraisers, Investiture, 
etc. Go over a possible year calendar. Handout—Sample Club Year Calendar.
       
Weekly Club Meeting Programming
Most Pathfinder clubs meet on a weekly basis; however, some only meet twice a month. 
How often a club meets, when it meets, and 
where it meets should determine duration of a club meeting. 
       
Activities
• Review the Handout—Sample Weekly Club Meeting Outline.
• Demonstrate opening ceremonies with your participants. 
       
Church Board Approval
The church board must approve the Pathfinder Club’s annual calendar. This provides two 
important advantages for the club. First, it 
builds board members’ respect for the Pathfinder Club. When the board is aware of the 
club’s plans, the club is in a better position 
to ask for monetary considerations when the 
board develops the annual church budget. 
Second, the church board must approve all 
Pathfinder activities in order for them to be 
covered by the church’s insurance. 
       
Investiture Achievement Planning
Investiture Achievement (IA) is the core curriculum for Pathfinder club ministry. Most 
activities and events can be developed and 
planned to fulfill the requirements throughout the Pathfinder year. Therefore, it is important that you spend time grasping the 
scope and sequence of Investiture Achievement. Area Coordinators and other experienced Pathfinder staff are available to help 
you learn how to implement the many Investiture Achievement tasks into your club’s 
planning and programming. Introduce the six 
basic Investiture Achievement titles and their 
corresponding grade level.
       
Activity
Give each participant the scope and sequence Friend and Trail Friend. Go over the 
Handout Friend Requirements which distinguishes between Friend and Trail Friend, and 
show how they can be incorporated into the 
weekly meetings. Note that some activities 
are seasonal.
       
Handout—Honor Requirement Sheets for 
Friend Honors (Camping Skills 1, Christian 
Citizenship, Red Alert, Seeds)
       
Staff Meetings
In addition to club meetings, Pathfinder Club 
Staff should meet at least once per month or 
more to plan all the details for club nights as 
well as other events and activities. Staff meetings are crucial to the success of a Pathfinder 
club! The club mission and goals should determine the regularity of staff meetings rather than the convenience of time.
Give each participant Handout—Sample 
Staff Meeting Agenda and Follow-up Minutes. Note the importance of an agenda, and 
the function of meeting minutes.
       
Staff meetings should include but are not limited to the following:
• Opening prayer
• Treasurer’s report
• Investiture Achievement
• Honors
• Special programs (Induction, Pathfinder Sabbath, Investiture, etc.)
• Outreach projects
• Calendar events and changes
• Conference events
• Specific items of interest for your club
• Planning session for at least 3 to 6 months in advance
• Closing prayer Activities
• Build your yearly club calendar that incorporates your conference and school calendars. 
• Incorporate aspects of Investiture Achievement into your yearly club calendar. Refer to Handout -Sample Year Calendar (which incorporates both Investiture Achievement and honors over a school year).
• Plan a weekly club meeting with opening and closing ceremonies. (Handout—Sample Weekly Meeting Outline).
• Outline the agenda for a single staff meeting preparing for a Friend honor, Camping Skills 1.
