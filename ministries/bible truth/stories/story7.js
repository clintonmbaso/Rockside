Lesson 26 - The Setting up of Christ’s Kingdom

Let’s begin with the prophetic declaration. God revealed future events to King Nebuchadnezzar through a dream. As we read in Daniel 2:1, “In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.” But it wasn’t just an ordinary dream. Daniel 2:28 tells us, “But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.”
This dream revealed a long sequence of events—covering over 2,500 years of history. In Daniel 2:45, it says, “The great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.” Daniel was the one chosen to interpret the dream, not because of his own wisdom, but because God revealed it to him. As Daniel humbly acknowledges in Daniel 2:30, “This secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living.”
The image seen in the dream was of a great statue composed of various metals. Each part of the statue represented a different kingdom in world history, all eventually being crushed by a great stone, representing Christ’s eternal kingdom.
The head of gold represented Babylon, which ruled from 605 to 538 B.C. Daniel 2:38 confirms this: “Thou art this head of gold.” Following Babylon was Medo-Persia, represented by the breast and arms of silver. Daniel 2:39 states, “And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee.” Then came Greece, with the belly and thighs of brass, described in the same verse as “another third kingdom of brass.” After Greece, the Roman Empire came into power, symbolized by legs of iron. In Daniel 2:40, we read, “And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron.”
After the fall of Rome, the dream shows the feet made of iron mixed with clay—symbolizing Divided Europe. According to Daniel 2:41-43, these kingdoms would not hold together: “They shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.” Finally, the stone that crushes the image represents Christ’s Kingdom. Daniel 2:44 says, “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed.”
Let’s break down the timeline once more for clarity. First, Babylon (605–538 B.C.) is described in Daniel 2:37-38 as the head of gold. Next is Medo-Persia (538–331 B.C.), referred to in Daniel 2:39. After that, Greece (331–168 B.C.) emerges, and then Rome (168 B.C. – A.D. 476), a powerful iron kingdom. Following Rome is the fragmented period of Divided Europe, beginning around 476 A.D. and continuing until now. Finally, we come to Christ’s Eternal Kingdom, as described in Daniel 2:44-45. God’s kingdom will be set up during this divided period, and it will never be destroyed. The stone becomes a great mountain, filling the whole earth.
And now, let’s talk about the fulfillment. History has confirmed the accuracy of the prophetic vision given in Daniel chapter 2. Each empire rose and fell, just as foretold. Today, we live in the period represented by the divided kingdoms. And it is during this time that God will set up His eternal kingdom. Daniel 2:44 assures us of this promise: “In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom…”
With this understanding, we are called to prepare our hearts. We are not just learning history—we are being reminded of what is to come. As 2 Peter 3:13-14 encourages us, “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.”
Let us be ready for the coming of Christ’s eternal kingdom.

  <h2>Lesson 27 - Empires of Prophecy</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h3>1. Prophecy and History</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>a.</strong> The vision of Daniel in <b>Daniel 7:1-7</b> describes four beasts rising from the sea, each different from the others—symbolizing four successive kingdoms on Earth.
  </p>

  <h4>b. Prophetic Symbols</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Winds: Strife</strong> - <em>Jeremiah 25:31</em> “A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations…” <br>
      <em>Jeremiah 49:36-37</em> speaks of bringing "the four winds from the four quarters of heaven,” symbolizing turmoil and conflict.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Waters: Peoples and Multitudes</strong> - <em>Revelation 17:15</em> “The waters which thou sawest... are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.”
    </li>
    <li><strong>Beasts: Kings and Kingdoms</strong> - <em>Daniel 7:17</em> “These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.”<br>
    <em>Daniel 7:23</em> “The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth…”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>c. The Four Beasts Represent Kingdoms</h4>

  <h5>(1) The Lion - Babylon</h5>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 7:4</em>: “The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings...” This symbolized Babylon, as also seen in Daniel 2 (the head of gold). Babylon was majestic, but the wings being plucked indicated its fall (cf. Daniel 5).
  </p>

  <h5>(2) The Bear - Medo-Persia</h5>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 7:5</em>: “...and behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth...” This represents the dual monarchy of Medes and Persians (cf. Daniel 8:3, 20).
  </p>

  <h5>(3) The Leopard - Grecia</h5>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 7:6</em>: “...like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads...” This fast-moving beast with multiple heads symbolized the swift conquests of Alexander the Great and the division of his empire after his death.
  </p>

  <h5>(4) The Dreadful Beast - Rome</h5>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 7:7</em>: “...behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible... and it had great iron teeth...” <br>
    <em>Daniel 7:23</em>: “The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth...” This represents imperial Rome, which corresponds to the iron legs in Daniel 2.
  </p>

  <h5>(5) The Ten Horns - European Kingdoms</h5>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 7:24</em>: “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise...” These correspond with the ten toes in Daniel 2, symbolizing the divided Roman Empire into European nations.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Fourth Beast and the Little Horn</h3>

  <h4>a. Character of the Fourth Kingdom</h4>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 7:7, 19, 23</em> describe this kingdom as "exceedingly dreadful," "devoured, brake in pieces," and "stamped the residue with the feet of it."
  </p>

  <h4>b. The Little Horn</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rises After the Ten Horns:</strong> <em>Daniel 7:24</em> “And another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.”
    </li>
    <li><strong>Among the Ten Horns:</strong> <em>Daniel 7:8</em> “I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn...”
    </li>
    <li><strong>Persecutes the Saints:</strong> <em>Daniel 7:21</em> “I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them.” <br>
    <em>Daniel 7:25</em>: “And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High...”
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The “little horn” is interpreted as representing Papal Rome. History shows its rise after the fall of Pagan Rome, and its power over Europe for centuries.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Eternal Kingdom</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Daniel 7:13-14</em>: “I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven... And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom...” <br>
    <em>Daniel 7:26-27</em>: “But the judgment shall sit... And the kingdom and dominion... shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High...”
  </p>
  <p>
    This points to the final victory of Christ and His saints. As <em>Revelation 22:14</em> says: “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Early Writings, p. 51:</strong> “All who keep the commandments of God will enter in through the gates into the city... and ever be in the presence of the lovely Jesus, whose countenance shines brighter than the sun at noonday.”
  </p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> These prophetic symbols highlight the connection between world history and God’s divine plan, showing that human kingdoms rise and fall, but the kingdom of Christ is everlasting.</p>

Lesson 27 - Empires of Prophecy

In this lesson, we examine the empires prophesied in the book of Daniel and their significance in God’s divine plan. The first section focuses on the vision of Daniel in Daniel 7:1-7, which describes four beasts rising from the sea. These beasts represent four successive kingdoms on Earth. This vision is a powerful symbol of the unfolding of history and the rise and fall of empires.
The vision uses several prophetic symbols to represent different aspects of human history. The winds symbolize strife, as seen in Jeremiah 25:31 and Jeremiah 49:36-37. The waters symbolize peoples and multitudes, as stated in Revelation 17:15. The beasts represent kings and kingdoms, as described in Daniel 7:17 and 7:23. These symbols help us understand the chaotic forces and powerful rulers that shape the world.
The four beasts in Daniel’s vision each represent a different kingdom. The first beast, a lion with eagle's wings, symbolizes Babylon, a kingdom that was majestic but eventually fell, as noted in Daniel 7:4 and Daniel 5. The second beast, a bear, represents the Medo-Persian Empire, as described in Daniel 7:5. The third beast, a leopard, symbolizes Greece, with its swift and expansive empire under Alexander the Great, as seen in Daniel 7:6. The fourth beast, described as dreadful and terrible with iron teeth, represents the Roman Empire, which is depicted in both Daniel 7:7 and Daniel 7:23.
The vision also mentions ten horns that represent ten kings who arise from the Roman Empire, symbolizing the division of the empire into European nations. This is further explained in Daniel 7:24.
The second section of the lesson focuses on the fourth beast and the little horn. The fourth kingdom is described as "exceedingly dreadful" and one that "devours and breaks in pieces" in Daniel 7:7, 19, and 23. The little horn, which rises after the ten horns, is said to subdue three kings and persecute the saints, as outlined in Daniel 7:8, 7:21, and 7:25. The "little horn" is interpreted as representing Papal Rome, which rose after the fall of Pagan Rome and held power over Europe for centuries.
The final section of the lesson turns to the eternal kingdom, which is the kingdom of Christ. In Daniel 7:13-14, Daniel sees a vision of the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven, receiving dominion, glory, and a kingdom. This passage points to the ultimate victory of Christ and His saints, as described in Daniel 7:26-27. Revelation 22:14 adds that those who keep God’s commandments will have the right to the tree of life and enter the gates of the city.
This prophecy highlights the connection between world history and God’s divine plan. While human kingdoms rise and fall, the kingdom of Christ is everlasting, and all who follow Him will be in His presence forever, as written in Early Writings, p. 51. The prophecy reminds us that, though the empires of this world may seem powerful, God’s eternal kingdom will triumph in the end.
Note: These prophetic symbols show the unfolding of God’s plan in history. Human empires may rise and fall, but the kingdom of Christ will last forever.
