<h2>Obstacles to Overcome</h2>

<p>If the internal tensions were not enough, the fledgling church had to cope with a major external obstacle as well. The <strong>American Civil War</strong> was in full swing (<strong>1861-1865</strong>) precisely at the same time.</p>

<p>Military service and the normal disruptions created by warfare were major issues to deal with while attempting to keep a clear focus on the mission of the remnant church.</p>

<p>Once the church was formally organized, one of the first immediate benefits appeared when the <strong>United States government granted noncombatant status</strong> to its members in <strong>1864</strong>.</p>

<h2>A Call to Go West</h2>

<p>As soon as the war was over, the church was again able to think about expansion. While Michigan and the other states of the midcountry were considered the "<strong>West</strong>," now the "<strong>far West</strong>" opened up new possibilities.</p>

<p>A Macedonian call came from fourteen members living "<em>way out there</em>," so at the General Conference session of <strong>1868</strong>, Elders <strong>J. N. Loughborough</strong> and <strong>D. T. Bourdeau</strong> were appointed to go to the West Coast. The work grew very quickly and spread into <strong>Western Canada</strong> as well.</p>

<p>The Whites visited the Pacific Coast in <strong>1872</strong>. As a result of this trip and seeing the needs of the work in that area, they <strong>sold their home in Battle Creek</strong> and donated the money to support the mission there.</p>

<p>By <strong>1874</strong>, the first issue of <em>Signs of the Times</em> came off the presses in the West. Today, nearly one-third of the <strong>North American Division</strong> membership resides in the two Western unions.</p>

<h2>Expanded Publications</h2>

<p>In <strong>1865</strong>, Ellen White’s six pamphlets on health, based on an <strong>1863 vision</strong>, were released. The need for this instruction was desperate, as many of the pioneer leaders were in very poor health due to ignorance.</p>

<p>While the believers had been active in <strong>temperance work</strong>, they were not fully aware of the positive aspects of healthful living. Continuing with the same theme, in <strong>1866</strong>, the magazine <em>Health Reformer</em> appeared as the church’s first health journal.</p>

<h2>Health Institutions Established</h2>

<p>As a direct result of a second vision on health received by <strong>Ellen White</strong>, a health institution was opened in <strong>1866</strong>. It was first called the <em>Western Health Reform Institute</em> and later became world-famous as <strong>Battle Creek Sanitarium</strong>.</p>

<p>It was paid for by personal pledges, with <strong>James White</strong> and <strong>J. P. Kellogg</strong> each contributing <strong>$500</strong>. This institution became the first of what would grow into one of the largest chains of medical institutions in the world.</p>

<p>In <strong>1883</strong>, <strong>Dr. Kate Lindsay</strong> helped start a <em>school of medicine</em> at Battle Creek.</p>

<h2>Schools Established</h2>

<p>Sporadic efforts had been made to establish church schools as early as <strong>1853</strong>. Possibly the first of these was sponsored by <strong>John Byington</strong>, with his daughter, <strong>Martha</strong>, serving as the teacher at Buck’s Bridge, New York.</p>

<p>The first official Seventh-day Adventist school anywhere in the world was begun in <strong>1872</strong> at Battle Creek by <strong>Goodloe H. Bell</strong>, a former patient of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. The school was housed in the building originally built for the press.</p>

<p>Today, the church operates more schools around the world than any other Protestant denomination.</p>

<h2>Camp Meetings Launched</h2>

<p>The early Adventists had held camp meetings prior to <strong>1844</strong>, but the idea had fallen by the wayside due to public ridicule. However, five years after the General Conference was organized, the idea was revived. In <strong>1868</strong>, the first Seventh-day Adventist camp meeting was held on a farm in Michigan, with <strong>two thousand</strong> in attendance.</p>

<p>By <strong>1878</strong>, the attendance at a camp meeting near Boston had grown to <strong>20,000</strong>. Today, these special meetings are held in many parts of the world, with some of the largest gatherings taking place in East Africa.</p>

<h2>Sabbath Schools Started</h2>

<p>The first Sabbath school lessons appeared in the <em>Youth’s Instructor</em> in <strong>1852</strong> and were written by James White. G. H. Bell, known as “the born teacher,” had experience in Sunday school work. In <strong>1869</strong>, he prepared two series of lessons for Sabbath schools, and the following year, a simple programming format was added, launching the Sabbath school movement.</p>

<p>The first Sabbath school gifts to missions were sent to <strong>Australia</strong> in <strong>1885</strong> and to <strong>Africa</strong> in <strong>1887</strong>. Later, a ship named the “Pitcairn” was sent to the South Pacific, traveling the South Seas for several years and taking missionaries to many islands. Today, the population of Pitcairn Island is entirely Seventh-day Adventist.</p>

<p>By the close of the year <strong>2000</strong>, church statistics showed there were <strong>14,548,500</strong> Sabbath School members around the world.</p>

<h2>Tract Society Formed</h2>

<p>The Vigilant Missionary Society, formed in <strong>1869</strong>, made one of its top priorities the wider distribution of literature. Stephan N. Haskell recognized the potential in this work and organized it on a broader basis. These groups soon became known as “tract and missionary societies.” Today, they are represented by the Publishing Department (Colporteur Ministry) and the Adventist Book Centers.</p>

<p>At the <strong>General Conference</strong> of <strong>1873</strong>, a Missionary Society was formed, leading to an increase in missionary work (witnessing and outreach participation) among members. This society later became the Lay Activities Department, and eventually Personal Ministries.</p>
