<h2>Last of the Pioneers Dies</h2>

<p>J. N. Loughborough died in 1924, and one might think that with the death of the last of the pioneers, the movement might stagnate, crumble, fracture, and finally disappear. That’s what happens to most ideologies or personality-centered movements. But the Personality guiding this one does not depend on specific individuals, and His ideology is eternal.</p>

<p>See what happened: At the next General Conference session (1926), 150 workers were sent overseas to new fields of labor. Hospitals, schools, and printing presses were opened in Ethiopia, Japan, Poland, Angola, the Philippines, China, Malaya, Java, Trinidad, and India. New missions were organized in the South Seas, Middle East, Cameroons, Brazil, and the West Indies. The seed sown by the pioneers, watered by the Holy Spirit, bore fruit.</p>

<h2>Depression Years</h2>

<p>All this occurred in a decade that also saw a worldwide collapse of the financial markets in what is known as the Great Depression. Elder C. H. Watson, president of the Australasian Division, was invited to be the General Conference president in 1930— the worst of times. He was noted for financial integrity and business acumen, and even though the next four years saw church income decrease by $54 million U.S., membership increased by 90,000, 48 missions were organized, and 654 additional workers employed. Suffice it to say, “The Lord blessed.”</p>

<h2>Youth Ministry</h2>

<p>Youth Ministry filled in many of the components that continue to shape and guide the focus today. MV Weeks of Prayer began in 1924. The Junior Manual was translated into Chinese and Spanish in 1927. Sixteen Vocational Merits were introduced in 1928 (today’s Honors listing over 250).</p>

<p>Another forerunner of Pathfinders began in Switzerland in 1939 (Advent Wacht), and in the Pacific Northwest were the Trailblazers in 1942. Finally, in 1946 the first Conference-sponsored Pathfinder Club was born in California, and John Hancock designed the triangular emblem that is now recognized and worn with pride around the world by nearly two million Pathfinders.</p>

<p>Numerous individuals in local churches had begun taking their children on camping experiences for several years, but the spiritual benefits of this type of activity didn’t register with church leadership until the mid-Twenties. Australia held its first Junior Camp in 1925, and the following year (1926) camps were held in both Wisconsin (one for girls) and in Michigan (one for boys). They were so successful that the idea spread very quickly, even with very little support beyond a “blessing” from church administrators.</p>

<p>Wilbur Holbrook recalled that for his first camps in Wisconsin and Illinois (1927), the conference loaned him $2.50, and when he was 50¢ short at the close, it was taken from his salary. Today, camping in all of its multiple forms is an integral component of youth ministry (with huge financial backing by the church) around the world, with many thousands of young people attending, as well as developing leadership skills while serving on the staff.</p>

<h2>Medical Launches</h2>

<p>The church had become involved with ships before, but they were used for transport only. In 1931, Leo B. Halliwell and his wife, Jesse, introduced a revolutionary concept that has since been lauded and emulated by governments throughout the tropical world of the big rivers. The idea was to use boats as clinics to provide medical assistance in regions unreachable by more conventional means.</p>

<p>The first and most famous of the launches was named <strong>Luzeiro I</strong>, which still serves on the Amazon and its tributaries. For their creativity and sacrificial work, the Halliwells were awarded the highest recognition the Brazilian government gives to civilians.</p>

<p>Today, the church in Brazil still has more than a dozen medical boats plying its many rivers alongside government-sponsored boats. In other countries, such as Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and in Africa and Asia, there are or have been at times other boats also taking healing and salvation to those who need and seek.</p>

<h2>Theological Seminary</h2>

<p>To keep pace with rising standards of education, the <strong>Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary</strong> was established in Washington, D.C. in 1936. In 1960, it became part of the newly named <strong>Andrews University</strong> in Michigan.</p>

<p>Today, advanced degrees in many aspects of theology are taught in numerous Adventist universities around the world, ensuring the continued growth and development of church leadership and theological scholarship.</p>

<h2>Beliefs</h2>

<p>The church has never taken a position on establishing a formal creed, as some denominations have. However, in 1931, the church adopted a <strong>Statement of Fundamental Beliefs</strong>, which helped solidify its doctrines in many areas.</p>

<p>Later, in 1941, a <strong>uniform baptismal certificate</strong> was introduced, including standardized questions of faith that candidates were required to agree to before baptism. These steps helped unify the church’s teachings and ensure consistency in doctrinal understanding among members worldwide.</p>

<h2>Radio Ministry</h2>

<p>The pioneer of religious radio broadcasting was <strong>Elder H. M. S. Richards</strong>, who aired his first broadcast in 1926. Initially, his office was a converted chicken house, as the denomination did not formally accept the project until 1941.</p>

<p>Today, <strong>The Voice of Prophecy</strong> is the oldest continuing religious broadcast in the world, with sister programs in many languages and countries. Media broadcasting now reaches more than 2,000 stations worldwide with weekly broadcasts. Several high-powered stations are owned by the church, and the number of local stations operated by both the church and its members continues to grow.</p>

<h2>World War II</h2>

<p>World War II had a significant impact, bringing many obstacles that hindered progress. Transportation became difficult, materials such as paper were in short supply, buildings and properties were destroyed, and workers were either imprisoned or evacuated. Additionally, ideological changes resulting from the war closed many doors to the gospel for decades.</p>

<p>However, even in the face of these challenges, God overruled in all obstacles, and the work prospered in unexpected ways and to unexpected degrees.</p>
