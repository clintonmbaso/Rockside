    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Club Ministries Training (CMT) is a curriculum framework that provides in-depth training for club staff in specific roles. The certifications are designed to be completed within one year, and are meant to equip leaders of all varieties for the ministries in which they serve. They are not levels of Investiture Achievement such as Sunbeam, Friend, or Guide, but rather opportunities for individuals to learn more about being an effective director, instructor, counselor, etc. Certifications are earned by attending workshops, working with a mentor, doing fieldwork, and preparing a documentation Portfolio.</p>

    <h4>Enhancing Transparency and Accountability</h4>

    <p>The role of secretaries and treasurers in any youth ministry is multifaceted. A report page offers them a structured platform to document meeting minutes, financial summaries, and membership updates. This not only enhances transparency within the ministry but also ensures accountability in resource management and decision-making processes.</p>
    <p>CMT is based on the Adventist Youth Ministry Training (AYMT) certifications, developed by the North American Division.</p>
  
    <h4>Optional</h4>
    <p>For Divisions that would like to recognize leaders that achieve these certifications, a pin with the achieved certification could be included in the official sash.
    <p>Shops, the participant is eligible to receive an enameled pin and certificate of completion.</p>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>CMT certifications are replacing the Pathfinder Leadership Award (PLA) and Advanced Pathfinder Leadership Award (APLA)/Pathfinder Instructor Award (PIA).</li>
        <li>Receiving a CMT pin is not considered investiture, but rather, awarding of a certificate. The highest investiture in Club Ministries continues to be Master Guide.</li>
        <li>CMT certifications are connected to a club role or position, meaning that there is no point to achieve them all unless you are the only leader in a club. CMT certifications are intended for all members of a team.</li>
      </ol>

 <h3>Workshop Content</h3>
    <h4>Club Ministries and Purposes</h4>
       <p>This workshop is about understanding how club ministries work to grow a child in Christ and keep them connected to the church. The focus of this training is Pathfinders.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Adventurer Ministries includes children from ages four through nine. The focus of this ministry is strengthening the family in their faith in Jesus Christ.</li>
         <li>Pathfinder Ministries includes children from ages 10 through 15. The focus of this ministry is to develop the faith of children and teens in Jesus Christ and provide them with lifelong mentors.</li>
         <li>Master Guide Ministries includes adults from age 18 and above. The focus of this ministry is to train adults for leadership in Adventurer, Pathfinder, Youth, and Young Adult ministries for nurture and outreach for Jesus Christ.</li>
       </ul>
       
    <h4>Pathfinder Club Ministry and Staff Roles</h4>
       <p>Review the philosophy, objectives and goals of Pathfinder club ministry. The strength and effectiveness of Pathfinder club ministry is directly proportional to the influence of the staff. How staff model the Pathfinder Pledge and Law, and their facilitation of the Pathfinder mission and goals will determine the strength of their club ministry.</p>

     <h4>Pathfinder Club Philosophy</h4>
       <p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church is committed to understanding young people and training its youth for leadership and service to humanity.</p>
       <p>The Pathfinder Club is a church-centered spiritual-recreational-activity program designed for young people 10 to 15 years of age. Pathfindering appeals to this age group because its program features activities that meet their needs and interests. Much of the Pathfinder Club program is built around physical action. This is because youth from 10 to 15 years of age are in a fast-growing physical stage of development. It is filled with action, adventure, challenge, group activities, and provides opportunities for the development of new attitudes and skills that produce personal growth, team or community spirit and a sense of loyalty and respect for God, His creation, and His church.</p>
       <p>While the Pathfinder Club exists primarily for youth, one of its basic purposes is to also bring together parents and church members through active involvement with the club and its members. Here the so-called generation gap disappears as young and old worship, work, and play together in a bond of common experience. Meaningful relationships are forged as leaders and counselors join with Pathfinders in sharing, building confidence, and working together.</p>
       <p>The whole philosophy of Pathfindering is built on the premise that “children learn best by example, rather than by precept.” As they see leaders and parents model spiritual and social values, they too will aspire to develop high moral principles, loving and caring attitudes, and determination to excel in all their various pursuits.</p>
       <p>Young people learn most effectively in a positive, happy, and secure atmosphere. The attitude of the club leaders is therefore a vital ingredient in guaranteeing the success and effectiveness of this ministry to youth. A failure to listen to and to understand the needs of the young people will erect barriers to real spiritual growth and development and may prove to be a contributing factor in making the church and its mission unattractive to the youth.</p>

    <h4>Objectives</h4>
       <ol>
         <li>Help the young people to understand that God and His church love them, care for them, and appreciate them. As Pathfinders are accepted and affirmed, they will appreciate the love of God revealed through the church and its ministry, and feel a need to be more committed to and involved with its program.</li>
         <li>Encourage Pathfinders to discover their own God-given potential and to use their gifts and abilities to fulfill God’s expectations for them and the part they can play in the great plan of salvation.</li>
         <li>Inspire young people to give personal expression of their love for God by uniting them together in various outreach activities.</li>
         <li>Make the number one priority of your club program the personal salvation of every Pathfinder. The Pathfinder age is a time when many decisions are being made that will affect the youth’s future relationships and his or her own personal development. The peak time for discovering and making a relationship with God appears to be around 12 years of age.</li>
         <li>Build into a Pathfinder’s life a healthy appreciation and love for God’s creation by enjoying outdoor activity (campouts, nature walks, nature honors, etc.). Pathfinders will be encouraged to experience a sense of wonder and worship as they observe and explore the beauty, the majesty, and the creative power in nature. Fellowship with God becoming more meaningful.</li>
       </ol>

    <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
       <p>Pathfinder Ministry is an organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, dedicated to meeting the mental, physical, social and spiritual developmental needs of youth ages 10-15 by challenging the Pathfinder to experience a personal relationship with Christ, have a sense of achievement and responsibility, develop respect for God’s creation, and care for each member of God’s family.</p>

    <h4>Goals</h4>
       <p>Pathfinder Ministries seeks to meet the Pathfinder’s present and unfolding needs, to the end that we bring them to self-fulfillment and maturity in Christian faith, characterized by their decision to:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Accept Jesus Christ as a personal Savior and Lord</li>
         <li>Reflect internalized Christian values through mature decision making and behavior</li>
         <li>Exhibit the righteousness, true holiness, and fullness of stature of Christ</li>
         <li>Demonstrate leadership skills, enabled and empowered to become full partners in active, selfless service supporting the mission of the church</li>
       </ul>
       
    <h4>Goals</h4>
       <p>Pathfinder Ministries seeks to meet the Pathfinder’s present and unfolding needs, to the end that we bring them to self-fulfillment and maturity in Christian faith, characterized by their decision to:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Facilitate a group discussion of specific ways staff can meet the goals and objectives of Pathfinder club ministry. Look specifically at the verbs (action words) in the goals and objectives.</li>
         <li>Give time for participants to write at least three ways they plan to personally emulate the Pathfinder club ministry goals to their Pathfinders.</li>
       </ul>
       
    <h4>Pathfinder History</h4>
       <p>Groups began forming in the late 1800s, however, it wasn’t until 1907 that groups became officially organized when the General Conference established its youth department under Elder M. E. Kern.</p>

         <li>Know what must be done to start or restart a Pathfinder Club</li>
         <li>Understand the club staff tasks and organize your staff accordingly</li>

         <li>Learn the components of a club merit system and how it is used to determine awards</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h4>Workshop Content</h4>
       <h5>Introduction to Club Organization</h5>
       <ul>
         <li>Give each participant a handout based on the local Conference guidelines on how to start or re-start a Pathfinder Club.</li>
         <li>Encourage participants to meet with their pastor, conference Pathfinder director, and Pathfinder area coordinator on a regular basis for guidance and direction as they begin building their church’s Pathfinder club ministry. Get Church Board Approval to Start a Pathfinder Club Ministry.</li>
         <li>Because having a Pathfinder Club is an outreach ministry of your local church, it is required that your church board approves it with recorded actions in the board minutes.</li>
         <li>Work with your pastor and put together a proposal to present to your church board.</li>
         <li>Get signatures from church board members as needed to obtain a Certificate of Operation from your conference Pathfinder office and mail or fax the completed form to your conference office.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h5>Gather Your Club Leadership Team</h5>
       <ul>
         <li>Get the support of your pastor and the church board, and recruit church members to become active as staff. Share the need, vision, and enthusiasm of what a Pathfinder club ministry can do for your youth and the larger community around your church.</li>
         <li>Ask your area coordinator to join you for staff organization meetings to help teach the fundamentals of Pathfinder club ministry and to build the vision of your staff.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h5>Recruit Pathfinders</h5>
       <ul>
         <li>Announce Pathfinder club ministry during the worship service. The church congregation can give support and enthusiasm for this ministry as you begin organizing.</li>
         <li>You and your staff should talk with potential Pathfinders and their parents. Tell them what Pathfinder club ministry is and the club’s plans for the year.</li>
         <li>Gather names of individuals in your church who can support the club by sponsoring a uniform for a Pathfinder, instructing a specific honor, and helping with fundraising, etc.</li>
         <li>Give participants the forms needed to register their clubs with the conference. Let them know what specific guidelines the conference has for Pathfinder club ministry.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h5>Staff Organization and Tasks</h5>
       <p>Pathfinder leaders are volunteers who receive no pay for their service to the church. In many cases, those who volunteer to be leaders are highly committed to Christian ideals. This is the way it should be, since the Pathfinder leader often plays a larger part in providing a Christian role model to young people than any other person in the church.</p>       
       
       <h5>Activity</h5>
       <p>Review the flow charts in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual. Give each participant time to draw the flow chart for their club including the specific names of individuals in each position.</p>
       
       <h5>Staff Training and Approval</h5>
       <p>To understand Pathfinder club ministry, all staff should undergo basic training to help them minister to Pathfinders. To continue effective ministry, continuing education is available.</p>
       <p>Because of the significant influence and responsibility that Pathfinder staff are given by parents, as well as church leaders, all volunteers working with minors must be approved by their conference prior to participating in Pathfinder club ministry. Let participants know what is required for volunteer approval in their conference.</p>         
       
       <h5>Club Leadership Team</h5>
       <p>The Pathfinder Club leadership team consists of a director, at least one deputy director, unit counselors and instructors, and a secretary and treasurer. These are the primary roles and each of them have specific tasks as organized by the club director.</p>
       <p>Review the qualities of a good leader (Pathfinder Administrative Manual).</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Love God supremely</li>
       <li>Love children sincerely</li>

       <li>Know the essential characteristics of adolescents</li>
       <li>Learn a variety of skills</li>
       <li>Develop the ability to organize</li>

       <li>Have a sense of humor</li>
       <li>Be resourceful and creative</li>
       </ul>
       
   <h5>Activity</h5>
       <p>Review duties of specific club staff positions. (Pathfinder Administrative Manual)</p>      
       <p>If a participant has not been designated a specific role in his/her club, encourage that person to identify a role of interest and discuss it with the club director.</p>

       <h5>Sample Weekly Club Meeting Outline</h5>
       <p>Demonstrate opening ceremonies with your participants.</p>
       
       <h5>Club Budget and Uniforms</h5>
       <p>Club Budget (Pathfinder Administrative Manual) - Every successful Pathfinder club operates within a financial budget. There are common components to a club budget. The finances that flow through the Pathfinder club are managed by the club treasurer in cooperation with the church treasurer. It is important for staff to be aware of how their club’s finances work</p>
       
       <h5>Activity</h5>
       <p>Review the sample budgets in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual as well as possible sources of income. It is imperative that clubs operate with fiscal responsibility. Expenses should never exceed income.</p>
       
       <h5>Uniforms</h5>
       <p>Review the purpose of the uniform and when it should and should not be worn.</p>     
       <p>Review the uniform standards under the www.gcyouthministries.org website.</p>
       <p>Review specific uniform standards for your local conference.</p>
       <p>Calculate the cost for a uniform for a Pathfinder and an adult, including items specific to your conference.</p>
       <p>Uniforms can have a major impact on a club budget. Each club should have a good plan for how they will manage uniform costs.</p>
       <p>Clubs have options when considering uniform expenses. They may require parents to purchase the uniform, the club may purchase the uniforms and operate an exchange or rental program, or the club may purchase certain pieces requiring the parents to purchase the remaining items. Clubs may also find sponsors willing to cover the cost of a uniform for a Pathfinder.</p>        

       <h5>Merit System and Awards</h5>
       <p>A club merit system provides a club a process for fairly awarding their Pathfinders in participation, progress, and development. Good Conduct Award and Pathfinder of the Year Awards have requirements that are met by using the club’s merit system. Use the Pathfinder Administrative Manual for each section below:</p>
       
       <h5>Merit System and Points</h5>
       <p>Each Pathfinder Club should have a Merit System for their Pathfinder Club and develop their own Merit System point values which are agreed upon by all Staff members and understood by all Pathfinders and parents. The club’s Merit System will help Staff to fairly determine awards to be given to their Pathfinders throughout the Pathfinder year. Simplicity is the key to a good merit system. Review the guidelines in the Pathfinder Administrative Manual.</p>
              
       <h5>Good Conduct Award & Pathfinder of the Year Award</h5>
       <p>The Club’s Investiture service is the place to reward club members for completing AY Investiture Achievement levels, honors, and special awards such as the Good Conduct Award and the Pathfinder of the Year Award.</p>
       
       <h5>Activity</h5>
       <p>Give each participant the guidelines for these awards from the Pathfinder Administrative Manual. Also include any guidelines and/or forms needed by the local conference office.</p>

<h4>Workshop Content</h4>
<h5>Club Mission, Goals, and Planning</h5>
   <p>The purpose of the Pathfinder club is to introduce young people to Jesus Christ and to help them grow in Him. The Pathfinder club program will help them develop their body, mind and spirit. With these skills, our young people are able to carry on the work of the church and bring others to the feet of Jesus.</p>

   <p>More than just skills, we want young people to build a relationship with Christ as their Lord and Savior, thus giving them the relational experience with Jesus that they need to lead their friends to know Him too.</p>
       
<h5>Review the Pathfinder mission statement and goals.</h5>
   <p>Discuss how these are important to keep in mind when planning club meetings and activities.</p>

<h4>Building a Club Calendar</h4>
   <p>It is challenging to develop the Pathfinder club yearly calendar. It takes time and effort to gather all the planning details and people together to make a plan, but it must be done if your club is going to succeed. Know that your club’s calendar planning is crucial for the success of your club.</p>
       
   <p>When planning your club’s calendar, begin by gathering other calendars that you will need to coordinate with. These include church school and conference calendars. Distribute a copy of the Conference Pathfinder newsletter and review the yearly calendar specifying the events that are mandatory and those that are optional. Handout—Calendar of Conference Events.</p>

   <p>Once you have gathered all necessary information, begin to set your meeting schedule, what day of the week you will meet at what time. Some clubs meet every week, and some meet twice a month. Determine what schedule works for your club. Once you know your weekly schedule, begin planning major programs such as Induction, Pathfinder Sabbath, club campouts, fundraisers, Investiture, etc. Go over a possible year calendar. Handout—Sample Club Year Calendar.</p>
       
<h4>Weekly Club Meeting Programming</h4>
   <p>Most Pathfinder clubs meet on a weekly basis; however, some only meet twice a month. How often a club meets, when it meets, and where it meets should determine duration of a club meeting.</p>
       
<h4>Activities</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Review the Handout—Sample Weekly Club Meeting Outline.</li>
   <li>Demonstrate opening ceremonies with your participants.</li>
</ul>
       
<h4>Church Board Approval</h4>
   <p>The church board must approve the Pathfinder Club’s annual calendar. This provides two important advantages for the club. First, it builds board members’ respect for the Pathfinder Club. When the board is aware of the club’s plans, the club is in a better position to ask for monetary considerations when the board develops the annual church budget.</p>

   <p>Second, the church board must approve all Pathfinder activities in order for them to be covered by the church’s insurance.</p>

<h4>Investiture Achievement Planning</h4>
   <p>Investiture Achievement (IA) is the core curriculum for Pathfinder club ministry. Most activities and events can be developed and planned to fulfill the requirements throughout the Pathfinder year. Therefore, it is important that you spend time grasping the scope and sequence of Investiture Achievement. Area Coordinators and other experienced Pathfinder staff are available to help you learn how to implement the many Investiture Achievement tasks into your club’s planning and programming. Introduce the six basic Investiture Achievement titles and their corresponding grade level.</p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
   <p>Give each participant the scope and sequence Friend and Trail Friend. Go over the Handout Friend Requirements which distinguishes between Friend and Trail Friend, and show how they can be incorporated into the weekly meetings. Note that some activities are seasonal.</p>
       
   <p>Handout—Honor Requirement Sheets for Friend Honors (Camping Skills 1, Christian Citizenship, Red Alert, Seeds)</p>
       
<h4>Staff Meetings</h4>
   <p>In addition to club meetings, Pathfinder Club Staff should meet at least once per month or more to plan all the details for club nights as well as other events and activities. Staff meetings are crucial to the success of a Pathfinder club! The club mission and goals should determine the regularity of staff meetings rather than the convenience of time.</p>

   <p>Give each participant Handout—Sample Staff Meeting Agenda and Follow-up Minutes. Note the importance of an agenda, and the function of meeting minutes.</p>
       
   <p>Staff meetings should include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Opening prayer</li>
   <li>Treasurer’s report</li>
   <li>Investiture Achievement</li>
   <li>Honors</li>
   <li>Special programs (Induction, Pathfinder Sabbath, Investiture, etc.)</li>
   <li>Outreach projects</li>
   <li>Calendar events and changes</li>
   <li>Conference events</li>
   <li>Specific items of interest for your club</li>
   <li>Planning session for at least 3 to 6 months in advance</li>
   <li>Closing prayer Activities</li>
   <li>Build your yearly club calendar that incorporates your conference and school calendars.</li>
   <li>Incorporate aspects of Investiture Achievement into your yearly club calendar. Refer to Handout -Sample Year Calendar (which incorporates both Investiture Achievement and honors over a school year).</li>
   <li>Plan a weekly club meeting with opening and closing ceremonies. (Handout—Sample Weekly Meeting Outline).</li>
   <li>Outline the agenda for a single staff meeting preparing for a Friend honor, Camping Skills 1.</li>
</ul>

   <li>The Pathfinders are in full class A dress uniform because of the guest speaker.</li>
   <li>Every program should have a purpose. Today’s program was to help us see we have to live by law (man’s law, recreational laws, God’s law and the Pathfinder law).</li>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Mentoring youth as evangelists to serve their community is a core goal of club ministry. This workshop explores faith development within the Investiture Achievement curriculum, particularly in the Personal Growth, Spiritual Discovery, and Serving Others sections. Techniques will be discussed for integrating outreach into the Pathfinder calendar. Many honors from the Spiritual Growth, Outreach and Heritage category provide wonderful opportunities for reaching your community.</p>


<h4>Audience/Participants</h4>
<p>New Pathfinder staff and individuals completing the prerequisites for Master Guide</p>

<h5>Key Texts</h5>

   <li>Pathfinder Administrative Manual</li>
   <li>Serving Communities honor requirements</li>
   <li>Investiture Achievement requirements for Companion, Explorer, Ranger</li>
   <li>Honors Requirements—Serving Communities</li>

<ol>
   <li>Understand how Investiture Achievement requirements enable personal growth.</li>
   <li>Encourage spiritual discovery in Pathfinders through the Bible and history.</li>
   <li>Engage Pathfinders in connecting with their community through Share Your Faith activities.</li>
   <li>Integrate outreach events into your club calendar.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Workshop Content</h4>
   <p>Opening Activity: Key Texts Discussion: Read the key texts and discuss how we can apply these stories in our Pathfinder club ministry.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Luke 10:25-37: Christ shared this parable in response to the question, “Who is my neighbor?” The real neighbor, Jesus says, is the person who shows mercy in concrete ways. He commanded His followers, “Go and do likewise.” This story is particularly important because Jesus chose to make the exemplary individual, the Good Samaritan, a member of an ethnic group that was despised, looked down upon and discriminated against by the religious community to which Jesus belonged. He is pointing out that following Jesus is about the content of your character, not your race, culture, or gender.</li>

   <li>Matthew 25:31-46: This parable is the last in a series of four parables that Jesus shared in Matthew 24-25 in response to questions from His disciples about end-time events: “When will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age? This passage teaches us that Christ desires us to reveal His character through ethical and compassion conduct.</li>

   <p>The mission of Pathfinders is to bring children to Jesus and to help children to grow in Jesus. The Pathfinder Pledge and Law summarize our mission. The Investiture Achievement (IA) curriculum is the backbone of Pathfinder club ministry. It has three sections common to each Investiture Achievement level that intentionally facilitate spiritual development.</p>

   <p>They are: Personal Growth, Spiritual Discovery, and Serving Others.</p>
   <p>In this module, we will research and explore each of these sections.</p>
<ol>
   <li>Review the Pathfinder Pledge and Law.</li>

<h4>Activity</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Download and print: Pledge and Law.</li>
   <li>Discuss as a group specific, engaging ways you can help your Pathfinders understand the Pathfinder Pledge and Law. Write on the Pledge and Law Handout some ideas of how you would engage your Pathfinders to “Learn the meaning of the Pathfinder Pledge and Law.”</li>
</ul>

   <li>Understand how Investiture Achievement requirements enable personal growth.</li>

   <p>Pathfinders has proven to be one of the great soul-winning agencies of our church, with a leadership that dedicates its time, talents, and energy to keeping the program running smoothly. It is designed to help Pathfinders sense their God-given destiny and keep them marching together in step toward the Kingdom of God.</p>

Activity
•Review the Personal Growth sections of the Investiture Achievement levels in order to grasp an overall perspective.</li>

• Have each participant look over the Companion and Trail Companion scope and sequence.</li>

Review the Personal Growth section, specifically 3.b. The Pathfinder staff help the Pathfinder understand and practice the meaning of “Be pure, kind, and true” and “Keep the morning watch” and “Go on God’s errands.”

   <li>Encourage spiritual discovery in Pathfinders through the Bible and history.</li>

Review the Spiritual Discovery section of Investiture Achievement Companion noticing all four components that the Pathfinders are required to learn. Use the resources of your pastor and your entire church membership to come and assist you with your Pathfinder’s learning. These requirements can be spread throughout the Pathfinder year.

Many of these activities can be incorporated into your weekly club worship. Review the Spiritual Discovery sections of Explorer and Ranger.

Activity
• How can you incorporate these requirements into your meetings?</li>
• Do you have specific individuals in mind who can assist you?</li>

   <li>Engage Pathfinders in connecting with their community through Share Your Faith activities.</li>
</ol>

   <p>Pathfinders should teach members how to become good citizens of their communities.</p>

   <p>Involving Pathfinders in the community fosters an interest in service to others. Clubs can impact their communities in many ways. Organization is one of the key components to successful community service projects.</p>

   <p>Community service projects also present great opportunities to involve parents and other church members. Ask for their help in finding projects and organizing the finer details. The more people you include, the more you can accomplish.</p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Review the Serving Others section of the Investiture Achievement for the Friend, Companion, and Explorer levels.</li>

   <li>Study the Ranger Level Requirements, Serving Others section. You will notice that the Pathfinders are required to fulfill requirements within the Serving Communities Honor.</li>

   <li>Discuss how these can be implemented in the club.</li>

   <p>Integrate Outreach Events into Your Club Calendar Evangelistic outreach is important to the Pathfinder program. Planning group outreach activities will encourage Pathfinders to share their faith. However, there is a difference between evangelistic outreach and community service projects. Both are important to include when planning your calendar.</p>

   <p>It is recommended that Pathfinder clubs incorporate an outreach event or Share Your Faith activity once a month. Sometimes this may take the place of the weekly club meeting. Other times it may be an additional event that happens on the weekend.</p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
   <p>Include these in your club’s schedule, keeping in mind what may be appropriate for a certain month or season.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Help clean up a public space.</li>
   <li>Adopt a “Grand friend” and visit or send cards.</li>
   <li>Collect and repair used bicycles for families or need.</li>
   <li>Conduct a Bible club for neighborhood children</li>
   <li>Build birdhouses and donate them to a nature center.</li>
   <li>Hold a grandparent’s tea at a local retirement home. Combine the activity with a lesson on good manners.</li>
   <li>Explore more ideas with your group.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Honors Relevant to Club Outreach</h5>
   <p>Within the vast collection of Adventist Youth Ministries Honors there is a group of honors classified as Spiritual Growth, Outreach, and Heritage. Within this classification there is also a subcategory of Adventist Community Service honors. Many of these honors are incorporated into the Investiture Achievement curriculum as well as the Master Guide requirements.</p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
   <p>Discuss with the participants how to incorporate outreach honors into club programming.</p>

   <p>Share your favorites. Download and print the honor requirements.</p>

     title: 'Ceremonies & Drill—PFAD 005',
                 content: `
<h3>Description</h3>
   <p>This workshop provides a practical introduction to using ceremonies and drill in a Pathfinder club.</p>

   <p>Included topics are fundamental stationary and marching commands, lead opening ceremonies, and understand flag etiquette.</p>

<h4>Audience/Participants</h4>
   <p>New Pathfinder staff and individuals completing the prerequisites for Master Guide.</p>

<h4>Resource Material</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Pathfinder Administrative Manual</li>
   <li>Pathfinder Club Drill Manual</li>
</ul>
 
<p>What Your Participants Will Learn</p>
<ol>
   <li>Know the basic marching elements for the traditional Pathfinder club meeting in the opening exercises</li>
   <li>Execute stationary commands with ease</li>
   <li>Be effective using your command voice</li>
   <li>Know the use and care of different types of flags</li>
</ol>

<h4>Workshop Content</h4>
   <p>Ideas for Workshop Presentation and Activities</p>
<ul>
   <li>Assemble students in Opening Exercises formation and lead them through a simple club opening ceremony.</li>
   <li>Teach students how to perform simple drill and marching commands.</li>
   <li>Share the procedure for the use of flags in your country, pointing out certain sentences or paragraphs that you want your students to grasp. Assign students to complete reading the entire document on their own.</li>
   <li>Present a sample of how a Formation for Opening Exercises is done in your area.</li>
   <li>Explain the Philosophy of Drill in order to compare and contrast the differences between Pathfinder drill and military drill.</li>

<h4>Opening Exercises</h4>
   <p>Traditionally many Pathfinder clubs have followed a simple opening exercise ceremony at the beginning of each weekly club meeting.</p>

   <p>The ceremony involves having the national flag and the Pathfinder flag posted in the front of the Pathfinder room and Pathfinders line up in single-file formation according to their unit. This ceremony may be facilitated by the Club Director or their designee. The Pathfinder Administrative Manual outlines a simple opening ceremony process.</p>

   <p>Explain each detail of the opening exercises.</p>

<h4>Stationary Drill</h4>
   <p>Stationary drill commands are basic commands used when standing still.</p>
   <p>The Pathfinder Club is a place where each youth develops his/her individual initiative and personality, and he/she learns to stand tall and straight physically and spiritually.
   <p>This individuality must not be suppressed, but it is also important that all learn to work together, play together, and live together in community.</p>

   <p>Demonstrate and practice the following commands:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Attention</li>
   <li>Dress right, dress and ready, front</li>
   <li>Present arms</li>
   <li>Parade rest</li>
   <li>Prayer attention</li>
   <li>Stand at ease</li>
   <li>Rest</li>
   <li>Fall out</li>
   <li>Fall in</li>
   <li>Right face</li>
   <li>Left face</li>
   <li>About face</li>

   <p>After the stationary commands have been learned, demonstrate the opening exercise ceremony using the appropriate commands.
   
   <p>Moving Commands Simple drill and marching are necessary for orderliness and for getting the Pathfinders into position for various activities. Pathfinder drill is a game to be enjoyed and should be used regularly at club meetings. It should not be prolonged to the point where the youth tire of it.</p>

   <p>Demonstrate and practice the following commands</P>
<ul>
   <li>Forward, march and halt</li>
   <li>Mark time, march</li>
   <li>Rear, march</li>
   <li>Right flank, march</li>
   <li>Left flank, march</li>
   <li>Column right, march</li>
   <li>Column left, march</li>
   <li>Eyes, right and Ready, front</li>
</ul>

<h4>Flag Etiquette</h4>
   <p>Pathfindering teaches care and concern for the national flag, state flags, and other flags.</p>

   <p>It is vitally important that all staff and Pathfinders have a basic knowledge of the use and care of flags.</p>

   <p>Go over each courtesy and position as listed.</p>
   <p>Teach the rules of saluting the flag.</p>
   <p>Demonstrate and practice folding the flag.</p>

<h4>Workshop Content</h4>
<h5>Understanding Pathfinders</h5>
   <p>What is the cause of behavior? Usually it is an effort to meet a psychological need. Like physical needs for air and food, humans have emotional needs, too. Many psychologists agree that it is not intellectual, but emotional growth and change that are of central importance. A young person’s feelings, not understandings, are the major forces that move them. Effective Pathfinder leaders understand a Pathfinder’s basic psychological needs.</p>

   <p>Pathfinders focuses on four areas of development: physical, mental, social, and spiritual.</p>

   <p>To better meet the needs of Pathfinders in these areas, it is important to understand the Pathfinder’s characteristics in these areas as they mature. Discuss with participants the stages of development in Pathfinders.</p>

   <p>Scripture on Stages of Development</p>
<ul>
   <li>Infancy—Jeremiah 1:5-7, Psalm 139:13-18</li>
   <li>Childhood—1 Timothy 4: 12; 2 Timothy 3:15; 2 Peter 3:18; Deut. 6:6, 7</li>
   <li>Old age—Ecclesiastes 3:1-8; Psalm 23</li>
</ul>

<h4>Basic Needs of Children</h4>
   <p>All children have certain basic needs as well as needs that are specific to their age and stage of development. The basic needs of children are:</p>

<h4>Physical</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Food</li>
   <li>Warmth</li>
   <li>Shelter</li>
   <li>Safety Mental</li>
   <li>Power to make choices and follow plans</li>
   <li>Learning one’s place in family, school and church. Discovering and developing one’s gifts and talents</li>
</ul>

<h4>Emotional</h4>
<ul>
   <li>A sense of belonging</li>
   <li>Approval and recognition</li>
   <li>Expressions of unconditional love and acceptance</li>
   <li>Freedom within defined boundaries</li>
   <li>Humor—opportunity to laugh</li>
</ul>

<h4>Spiritual</h4>
<ul>
   <li>An all-knowing, loving, caring God</li>
   <li>Forgiveness of wrongs and a chance to start over</li>
   <li>Assurance of acceptance with God</li>
   <li>Experience in prayer, answers to prayer</li>
   <li>A chance to grow in grace and in the knowledge of God</li>
</ul>

   <p>Each Division should develop this section to fit their ethnic and cultural context.</p>

<h4>Junior Pathfinders | PREADOLESCENCE (AGES 10-12)</h4>
<ul>
   <li>General description</li>
   <li>Mental characteristics</li>
   <li>Physical characteristics</li>
   <li>Social characteristics</li>
   <li>Spiritual characteristics</li>
</ul>

<h4>Teen Pathfinders | EARLY ADOLESCENCE (AGES 13-15)</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Mental characteristics</li>
   <li>Physical characteristics</li>
   <li>Social characteristics</li>
   <li>Spiritual characteristics</li>
</ul>

<h4>Activity</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Discuss how staff can help meet the needs of their Pathfinders.</li>
   <li>Share Scriptures which address the different stages of life.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Motivating Pathfinders</h4>
   <p>Involving Pathfinders in activities that build positive relationships among themselves and adults is fundamental to a Pathfinder club ministry. The use of ice-breaker games, hands-on learning activities, teamwork, group planning, practicing drill, involvement in ceremonies, earning awards, traveling together, etc. are the types of things that motivate Pathfinders.</p>

   <p>Teach and play a game that helps Pathfinders get to know each other.</p>

<h4>Effective Program Planning</h4>
   <p>When planning club programs, it is important to take into consideration the interests and developmental needs of your Pathfinders.</p>

   <p>What young Pathfinders experience as new and exciting, teen Pathfinders may have already been doing for two or three years and they consider it to be “boring.” It is common that a club will lose their Pathfinders by the time they are 14, unless there is a new experience of Pathfindering that will challenge and excite them to stay involved.</p>

   <p>Discuss with participants appropriate activities for Junior Pathfinders and Teen Pathfinders. Interacting and Involving Pathfinders Along with intentional programming, there also need to be shared responsibilities as well as appropriate interaction with staff. For instance, what happens when a staff member tells a Pathfinder or staff to do something?</p>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Junior Pathfinder</strong>: will most likely gladly do it.</li>
   <li><strong>Teen Pathfinder</strong>: will most likely question them.</li>
   <li><strong>Collegiate Staff</strong>: will most likely tell them what they think about the task.</li>
</ul>

   <p>How we treat Pathfinders at every level is vital to their continued involvement and effectiveness.</p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
   <p>Remind participants of the qualities of a Pathfinder leader as outlined in the Pathfinder Club Handbook. Also, staff meetings are vital to keeping a program running smoothly.</p>

   <a href="https://family.adventist.org/evangelistic-parenting/">Evangelistic Parenting</a>

<h4>Proper Discipline</h4>
   <p>“In a Pathfinder club, good discipline provides an environment that is conducive to cheerful attitudes and cooperative behavior. It emphasizes guidance rather than restraint and is constructive rather than destructive. It is not crippling; it is enabling. It encourages self-control and purposeful activity and discourages punishment.” NAD Pathfinder Administrative Manual</p>

   <p>It is vital to the success of a Pathfinder club and the cooperative participation of the Pathfinder staff to make sure that all staff members agree upon and follow the same discipline guidelines of the club.</p>

<h5>Activity</h5>
<ul>
   <li>Share a possible discipline policy for a club.</li>
   <li>Discuss examples of proper and improper discipline.</li>
