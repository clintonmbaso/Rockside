        <blockquote>
            “But he said to them, ‘Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:6">Mark 16:6</span></strong>, NKJV).
        </blockquote>
        <p>The crucifixion of Jesus destroyed the hopes and faith of His disciples. It was a dark weekend for them as they not only grappled with their Master’s death but feared for their own lives, as well (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:19">John 20:19</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>In <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong>, the final chapter in this Gospel, we will look at what followed His death.</p>
        <p>First, we will examine the timing of Jesus’ resurrection and why the women came to the tomb on that Sunday morning. Adventists have sometimes shied away from resurrection morning because of the way it is misused to support Sunday sacredness. We will instead see how we can rejoice in the Sunday resurrection, despite the false theology that has, unfortunately, arisen from it.</p>
        <p>Second, the lesson explains the first verses of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong>, linking these words to a theme that runs through the entire book. Our studies on Monday and Tuesday will look at these concepts.</p>
        <p>Third, Wednesday and Thursday will examine the rest of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16">Mark 16</span></strong> and consider the mission it sets before us. This study will close with a challenge to the reader of Mark to take the gospel throughout the world.</p>

    title: "Rejoicing in the Resurrection",
    text: `
        <p>All the Gospel writers agree that Jesus died on the day that they identify as the “preparation” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 27:62">Matthew 27:62</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 15:42">Mark 15:42</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 23:54">Luke 23:54</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:14, 31, 42">John 19:14, 31, 42</span></strong>). Most commentators understand this as a reference to sunset Thursday through sunset Friday. Jesus died late on Friday afternoon and was then quickly buried before sunset.</p>
        <p>During the Sabbath, the Lord rested in the grave, and all of Jesus’ disciples rested as well. “And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 23:56">Luke 23:56</span></strong>, NKJV), a rather strange action if, in fact, Jesus had lessened, at least in their minds, the obligation to keep the fourth commandment.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, the women bought spices, and on Sunday morning, they went to the tomb with the desire to complete the typical burial process. Of course, Jesus was not there!</p>
        <p>As early as the second century, Christians saw significance in the fact that Jesus rose on Sunday. This became the basis for Sunday sacredness. But is that what the New Testament teaches?</p>
        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Colossians 2:10-12">Colossians 2:10-12</span></strong>. What is the New Testament memorial of Jesus’ resurrection?</p>
        <p>Not a word in the Bible hints at Sunday sacredness as a memorial of the Resurrection. That memorial is baptism. “Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 6:4">Romans 6:4</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>
        <p>Regardless of the false theology regarding Sunday worship, as Adventists we must rejoice in the Sunday morning resurrection of Jesus. Jesus has triumphed over death, and in His resurrection, we have the surety of ours.</p>
        <p>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Peter 1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span></strong>, NKJV). Look at the certainty Paul had about the resurrection of Jesus. How can we have that certainty, as well?</p>

    title: "The Stone Was Rolled Away",
    text: `
        <p>The story of the resurrection appears in each of the Gospels. Each Gospel writer presents the story from a different perspective, but they all contain the core concepts that appear also in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 15:1-8">1 Corinthians 15:1-8</span></strong>.</p>
        <p>Four ideas appear again and again—died, buried, risen, seen. In Mark, “died” and “buried” are in chapter 15. The “risen” and “seen” appear in chapter 16, but with a twist. <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:7">Mark 16:7</span></strong> speaks of a meeting in Galilee, and there you will see Him (see <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 21">John 21</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>Some people find it incredible that Christians believe in a risen Lord. But the evidence for His resurrection is substantial and consistent with reason.</p>
        <p>For starters, all one has to do is believe in God as the Creator (see <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 1-2">Genesis 1 and 2</span></strong>) and the idea of the resurrection, of a miracle, becomes reasonable. The God who created the universe, and then life on earth, certainly had the power, if He chose, to resurrect Jesus. The existence of God doesn’t make the resurrection of Jesus inevitable, only reasonable.</p>
        <p>Next, the tomb was definitely empty. Even atheist historians accept that fact. If it were not, the claim about His resurrection would fail right from the start because the existence of His body there would destroy any claims of His having risen.</p>
        <p>Next, the explanation that His disciples stole the body does not work. The disciples surely couldn’t have gotten past the guards. And even if they had done so and got the body, why were the disciples never arrested for stealing it? The answer is that the religious leaders knew that the disciples had not done it.</p>
        <p>Also, numerous people testified that they saw the risen Christ. Many, including the disciples, did not at first believe. And one very solid enemy, Paul, not only claims to have seen the risen Lord but that this experience changed the whole trajectory of his life—in very radical ways, too.</p>
        <p>Finally (though there are many other reasons), how does one explain the rise of the Christian church, founded by people who claimed to have seen the risen Lord? Why would these people have been willing to die for what they knew was a lie? Their consistent testimony, both right after His death (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 3:15">Acts 3:15</span></strong>) and years later (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Peter 1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span></strong>), provides powerful evidence for His resurrection.</p>
        <p>If someone were to ask you, What evidence do you have for Christ’s resurrection, what would you say?</p>

    title: "The Women at the Tomb",
    text: `
        <p>“The women who had stood by the cross of Christ waited and watched for the hours of the Sabbath to pass. On the first day of the week, very early, they made their way to the tomb, taking with them precious spices to anoint the Saviour’s body. They did not think about His rising from the dead. The sun of their hope had set, and night had settled down on their hearts. As they walked, they recounted Christ's works of mercy and His words of comfort. But they remembered not His words, ‘I will see you again.’” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 16:22">John 16:22</span></strong>) — Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 788.</p>
        <p><strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:1-8">Mark 16:1-8</span></strong> recounts that the women came to the tomb to anoint Jesus’ body. They found the stone rolled away and were told by an angel that Jesus had risen. At first, they were frightened and fled, telling no one of what they had seen.</p>
        <p>From the beginning of Mark’s Gospel, the reader knows that Jesus is the Messiah. However, the first non-demon-possessed person to proclaim Him the Messiah is Peter in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 8:29">Mark 8:29</span></strong>, which happens halfway through the book.</p>
        <p>Throughout Mark, Jesus tells people to keep quiet about His identity and miracles. He tells a leper to stay silent in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 1:44">Mark 1:44</span></strong>, Jairus and his wife after their daughter's resurrection in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 5:43">Mark 5:43</span></strong>, and those present at the healing of the deaf and mute man in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 7:36">Mark 7:36</span></strong>. He even commands His disciples not to reveal He is the Messiah (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 8:30">Mark 8:30</span></strong>; see also <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 9:9">Mark 9:9</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>The reason for this was likely to ensure that Jesus completed His ministry according to the time prophecies in Daniel 9:24-27. But after the Resurrection, even though the women were initially afraid to speak, their silence did not last long.</p>
        <p>By the end of Mark’s Gospel, we read, “And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:20">Mark 16:20</span></strong>, ESV).</p>
        <p>The motif of silence about Jesus is shattered. The book concludes with the disciples spreading the good news of His resurrection and what He has done.</p>
        <p>Why must we not keep silent about Jesus and what He has done? Who can you tell today about Jesus and the plan of salvation?</p>

    title: "Appearing to Mary and Others",
    text: `
        <p>Almost all of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:9-20">Mark 16:9-20</span></strong> has parallels to other passages in the New Testament—Mary Magdalene at the tomb seeing Jesus (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:1, 9, 10">Matthew 28:1, 9, 10</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span></strong>; compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 8:2">Luke 8:2</span></strong>); two disciples see Him in the countryside (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 24:13-35">Luke 24:13-35</span></strong>); the 11 disciples are commissioned (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:16-20">Matthew 28:16-20</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 24:36-49">Luke 24:36-49</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:19-23">John 20:19-23</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>The first person to see Jesus alive was Mary Magdalene (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span></strong>). Other women saw Him as well (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:8-10">Matthew 28:8-10</span></strong>). It is significant that the first people to see the risen Lord were women. In the ancient world, women did not have high status as witnesses. If the story were fabricated, it would have been much more likely to name men as the first witnesses. But it is not men, not the 11, but a woman who first sees Jesus. She goes to tell the good news to the disciples, but, not surprisingly, they do not believe her testimony, most likely because it seemed fantastic and also, unfortunately, because Mary was a woman.</p>
        <p>Apologists for the resurrection story of Jesus have used this fact—that women were the first to see Jesus—as powerful evidence for the veracity of the story.</p>
        <p>In <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:14">Mark 16:14</span></strong>, Jesus rebukes the 11 disciples for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen. This makes no sense if the story were a fabrication. Why rebuke the disciples for something the author could have easily written differently?</p>

    text: `
        <p>The first words of Jesus to His disciples are recorded only in indirect discourse in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:14">Mark 16:14</span></strong>. He rebukes them for their unbelief and hardheartedness. This question of unbelief is not simply a modern problem. As we already have seen, the original disciples of Jesus struggled with belief (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:17">Matthew 28:17</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:24-29">John 20:24-29</span></strong>), and they were with Jesus in the flesh and saw, again and again, the miracles.</p>
        <p>But by various proofs, He demonstrated to them the reality of His resurrection. Their testimony, combined with the evidence summarized earlier, forms a firm foundation for faith.</p>
        <p>Jesus then commissions His disciples to take the gospel to the world. His command is expansive: they are to go to the entire world and proclaim the gospel to all creation. Jesus explains the outcome of their work—believers will be saved, unbelievers condemned.</p>
        <p>Jesus also describes signs that will accompany the disciples’ work—casting out demons, speaking new languages, protection from harm, and healing the sick. Some have mistakenly interpreted <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:18">Mark 16:18</span></strong> as a call for Christians to prove their faith by handling venomous snakes. However, no such action is authorized here. Jesus describes protection in mission, as shown in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 28:3-6">Acts 28:3-6</span></strong> when Paul was unharmed after a snake bite.</p>
        <p>The Bible does not teach that Christians will always be protected from harm. Sometimes God works miracles to further the gospel, while other times Christians may suffer for their witness. In such moments, their endurance becomes a testimony of faith to unbelievers.</p>
        <p>After His words, “He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:19">Mark 16:19</span></strong>, NKJV). Jesus ascended to the place of supreme power, having defeated all the forces of evil.</p>
        <p>Notice the final verse: though the disciples went “everywhere,” preaching the gospel, they did not go alone. “The Lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying signs. Amen” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 16:20">Mark 16:20</span></strong>, NKJV). He was with them then, and He promises to be with us as we continue their work.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I am with you always, even to the end of the age’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 28:20">Matthew 28:20</span></strong>, NKJV). What comfort can we take from this promise as we, too, seek to proclaim the gospel everywhere?</p>

        <p>Read Ellen G. White, <em>‘The Lord Is Risen,’</em> pp. 779-787; <em>‘Go Teach All Nations,’</em> pp. 818-828, in <em>The Desire of Ages</em>.</p>
        <p>“To the believer, Christ is the resurrection and the life. In our Saviour the life that was lost through sin is restored; for He has life in Himself to quicken whom He will. He is invested with the right to give immortality. The life that He laid down in humanity, He takes up again, and gives to humanity. ‘I am come,’ He said, ‘that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.’ ‘Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.’ ‘Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.’ <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:10">John 10:10</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:14">John 4:14</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:54">John 6:54</span></strong>.</p>
        <p>“To the believer, death is but a small matter. Christ speaks of it as if it were of little moment. ‘If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death,’ ‘he shall never taste of death.’ To the Christian, death is but a sleep, a moment of silence and darkness. The life is hid with Christ in God, and ‘when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.’ <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:51-52">John 8:51, 52</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Colossians 3:4">Colossians 3:4</span></strong>.”—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, pp. 786, 787.</p>
        <p>Even atheist historians, those who cannot accept the reality of the Resurrection, admit not only that Jesus had been killed but that after His death many people claimed to have seen the resurrected Christ, and as a result they began the nucleus of what became the Christian church. Some, in an attempt to explain why they claimed this, said that Jesus had a twin brother or that the early disciples hallucinated, thinking that they saw Jesus. Others said that Jesus never really died but only swooned and then, later, revived. Another person claimed that aliens came down and took the body. For a look at all these arguments and how they don’t work, see Clifford Goldstein, <em>Risen: Finding Hope in the Empty Tomb</em> (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press, 2021).</p>
        <h3>Discussion Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Why would the disciples have lied about the resurrection of Jesus? From all that we know, they faced nothing but hatred, alienation, and persecution for their belief. What would they have gained by making this story up?</li>

        <h3>A Church Built on Garbage</h3>
        <p><strong>By Andrew McChesney</strong></p>

        <p>Purna faced a seemingly impossible task. He had volunteered to plant a church in an unentered district of a major South Asian city, and he didn’t know where to start. He had moved to the district after volunteering to serve as a Global Mission pioneer. But how could he share his love for Christ with his non-Christian neighbors?</p>

        <p>“God, please help,” he prayed.</p>

        <p>Purna prayed for a week, but he still didn’t know where to start. But he did know one thing. He couldn’t stand the stench on the road outside his house. Piles of garbage and puddles of dirty rainwater mingled on the road. One morning, he saw that the garbage had blocked the gutters, and filthy water was overflowing onto the road. He decided to do something. Taking a long bamboo pole, he began picking away the trash from the gutters.</p>

        <p>As he worked, the neighbors noticed.</p>

        <p>“Did the city government send you to clean the road?” someone asked.</p>

        <p>Purna replied that he had not been hired to clean the road and that he simply lived on it. The neighbors were impressed. Nobody had ever cleaned the road before.</p>

        <p>“You’re a good man,” a neighbor said. “We need you here.”</p>

        <p>“Don’t ever leave here,” another said.</p>

        <p>As he cleaned the road, Purna became a local celebrity. Everyone knew him and was talking about him. People invited him into their homes.</p>

        <p>As he met the neighbors, he learned that one man was paralyzed on his left side. Purna, who had been trained in massage, offered to help. The man agreed, and Purna began to give massages. Every time they met, Purna prayed and then gave a massage. The man recovered fully.</p>

        <p>Neighbors were amazed to see the man in such good health.</p>

        <p>“Who healed you?” they asked.</p>

        <p>“Oh, it was the good man who cleans our road!” the man replied.</p>

        <p>Then the neighbors really wanted to get to know Purna. They began to ask for prayers and massages.</p>

        <p>Today, Purna has accomplished the seemingly impossible and planted a church. Eleven people have been baptized, and 20 others are studying the Bible. “Please pray for God to help us serve Him more and more,” Purna said. “Even today, I am cleaning the road. If I see garbage stuck in the drains, I clean it up.”</p>

        <p>Purna lives in a veiled country that Adventist Mission is not identifying so as to protect his work among a population often hostile to Christianity. Learn more about Global Mission pioneers on the Adventist Mission website: <a href="https://bit.ly/GMPioneers">bit.ly/GMPioneers</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Memory Text:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:30-31">John 20:30, 31</span></strong>, NKJV).</blockquote>
        <p>Why did John write his Gospel? Did he wish to emphasize Jesus’ miracles or some specific teachings of Jesus? What was the reason for writing what he did?</p>
        <p>Under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit, John explains why. He says that though many more things could be written about the life of Christ (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 21:25">John 21:25</span></strong>), the stories he included were written in order “that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:31">John 20:31</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>
        <p>This week we’re going to look at John's account of some of Jesus’ early miracles—from His turning water to wine at a wedding, to restoring to health someone’s very sick son, to the healing of the man at the pool of Bethesda.</p>
        <p>John calls these miracles “signs.” He does not mean something like a street sign, but rather a miraculous event that points toward a deeper reality: Jesus as the Messiah. In all these accounts, we see examples of people who responded by faith. And their examples invite us to do the same.</p>

        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 2:1-11">John 2:1-11</span></strong>. What sign did Jesus do at Cana, and how did this help His disciples in coming to believe in Him?</p>
        <p>Seeing Jesus perform the miracle of changing the water into wine provided evidence in favor of the disciples’ decision to follow Jesus. How could it not have been a powerful sign pointing to Him as being someone from God? (They probably were not yet ready to understand that He was God.)</p>
        <p>Moses was the leader of the Israelites, and he brought Israel out of Egypt by many “signs and wonders” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deuteronomy 6:22">Deuteronomy 6:22</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deuteronomy 26:8">Deuteronomy 26:8</span></strong>, NKJV). He was the one whom God used to free Israel from the Egyptians. (He was, in a sense, their “savior.”)</p>
        <p>God prophesied through Moses that a prophet would come who was like Moses. God asked Israel to hear Him (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deuteronomy 18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 17:5">Matthew 17:5</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 7:37">Acts 7:37</span></strong>). That “prophet” was Jesus and, in John 2, Jesus performed His first sign, which itself pointed back to the deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt.</p>
        <p>The river Nile was a key resource and a deity for the Egyptians. One of the plagues was directed at the river—the changing of its waters to blood. At Cana, Jesus performed a similar miracle but, instead of turning water into blood, He turned it into wine.</p>
        <p>The water came from six water pots used for purification purposes in Jewish rituals, linking the miracle even more closely to biblical themes of salvation. By recounting the incident of changing the water to wine, and thus referring back to the Exodus, John was pointing to Jesus as our Deliverer.</p>
        <p>What did the master of the feast think of the unfermented wine that Jesus provided? He was indeed surprised by the quality of the drink and, not knowing the miracle that Jesus had performed there, thought that they had saved the best for last.</p>
        <p>The Greek term <em>oinos</em> is used both for fresh and fermented grape juice (see <em>The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Dictionary</em>, p. 1177). Ellen G. White states that the juice produced by the miracle was not alcoholic (see “At the Marriage Feast,” <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 149). No doubt, those who knew what happened were astonished at what had taken place.</p>

        <p>All through His earthly ministry, Jesus performed miracles that helped people believe in Him. John recorded these miracles so that others would believe in Jesus, as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Read</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:46-54">John 4:46-54</span>. Why does the evangelist make a connection back to the miracle at the wedding feast?</p>
        <p>In giving an account of the second sign that Jesus did in Galilee, John points back to the first sign at the wedding in Cana. John seems to be saying, The signs that Jesus did will help you see who Jesus is. Then, John adds, “This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:54">John 4:54</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>
        <p>At first, Jesus’ response to the nobleman’s plea may seem harsh. Yet, this official had made the healing of his son the criterion for believing in Jesus. Jesus read his heart and pinpointed the spiritual sickness that was more profound than his son’s life-threatening illness. Like a lightning bolt from a blue sky, the man suddenly recognized that his spiritual poverty could cost the life of his son.</p>
        <p>It is important to recognize that miracles, in and of themselves, did not prove that Jesus was the Messiah. Others have performed miracles. Some were true prophets, others false. Miracles reveal only the existence of the supernatural; they don’t, by themselves, mean that God must be the One doing them. (Satan can perform “miracles,” if by the word “miracles” we mean supernatural acts.)</p>
        <p>The nobleman in anguish cast himself on Jesus’ mercy, pleading with Him to heal his son. Jesus’ response was reassuring. He said, “ ‘Go; your son will live’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:50">John 4:50</span></strong>, ESV). The verb “will live” in Greek is actually in the present tense. This usage is called a “futuristic present,” where a future event is spoken of with such certainty as if it were already happening. The man did not rush home but, believing Jesus, got home the next day—finding that, exactly when Jesus had said those words, the fever left his son.</p>
        <p>What a powerful reason to believe in Jesus!</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Even if we were to see a miracle, what other criteria must we look at before automatically assuming it is from God?</p>

        <p>The next sign John records took place at the Pool of Bethesda (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:1-9">John 5:1-9</span></strong>). It was believed that an angel caused movement in the water and that the first sick person to enter the water would be healed. As a result, the porches of the pool were crowded with those hoping to be cured at the next occurrence. Jesus went to Jerusalem, and as He passed by the pool, He saw the waiting throng.</p>
        <p>What a sight it must have been, too! All these people, some surely quite ill, waiting and waiting by the water for a cure that surely will not come. What an opportunity for Jesus!</p>
        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:1-9">John 5:1-9</span></strong>. Because anyone by the pool obviously wanted to get well, why did Jesus ask the paralytic if he wanted to be healed (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:6">John 5:6</span></strong>)?</p>
        <p>When one has been sick a long time, the sickness becomes the norm. And strange as it may seem, it can sometimes be a bit disturbing to leave the disability behind. The man implies in his answer that he wants healing. The problem is that he is looking for it in the wrong place—while the One who made man’s legs is standing right in front of him. Little did the man know who was talking to him; although after the healing, he might have started to understand that Jesus was, indeed, Someone very special.</p>
        <p><strong>“Jesus does not ask this sufferer to exercise faith in Him. He simply says, ‘Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.’ But the man’s faith takes hold upon that word. Every nerve and muscle thrills with new life, and healthful action comes to his crippled limbs. Without question he sets his will to obey the command of Christ, and all his muscles respond to his will. Springing to his feet, he finds himself an active man. . . . Jesus had given him no assurance of divine help. The man might have stopped to doubt, and lost his one chance of healing. But he believed Christ’s word, and in acting upon it he received strength.”</strong>—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, pp. 202, 203.</p>
        <p>Jesus later encountered the man in the temple and said, “ ‘You have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:14">John 5:14</span></strong>, NKJV). What is the relationship between sickness and sin? Why must we understand that not all sickness is a direct result of specific sins in our life?</p>

        <p>Signs, wonders, and miracles, in and of themselves, don’t prove that something is of God. But, on the other hand, when they are of God, it’s a dangerous thing to reject them.</p>
        <p><strong>Read John 5:10-16.</strong> What lessons can we take away from the amazing hardness of the religious leaders’ hearts in regard to Jesus and the miracle He had just performed?</p>
        <p>When Jesus revealed Himself to the man who had been healed, the man immediately told the religious leaders that it was Jesus. One would think this would be a time to praise God, but instead, the leaders “persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:16">John 5:16</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>
        <p>Healings were allowed on the Sabbath only in an emergency. This man had been disabled for 38 years; thus, his healing was hardly an emergency. And then, too, what was the necessity of having him take up his bed? One would think that someone with the power from God to perform such a miracle would also know if it was permissible to carry a mat home on the Sabbath day. Clearly, Jesus was seeking to take them to deeper biblical truths beyond the man-made rules and regulations that had, in some cases, stifled true faith.</p>
        <p><strong>What do these other accounts teach about how spiritually hard people can become, regardless of the evidence?</strong> (Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:1-16">John 9:1-16</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 3:22-23">Mark 3:22, 23</span></strong>; <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 12:9-14">Matthew 12:9-14</span></strong>).</p>
        <p>How could these religious leaders be so blind? The likely answer is that it was because of their own corrupt hearts, their false belief that the Messiah would deliver them from Rome now, and their love of power and lack of surrender to God. All these helped cause them to reject the truth that stood right before them.</p>
        <p><strong>Read John 5:38-42.</strong> What was Jesus’ warning? What can we learn from these words? That is, what could be in us that blinds us to the truths we need to know and apply to our own lives?</p>

    title: "Jesus’ Claims",
    lesson: "1",
    text: `
        <p>The miracle by the Pool of Bethesda provided an excellent opportunity for John to emphasize who Jesus is. John takes nine verses to describe the miracle and about 40 verses to describe the One who performed the miracle.</p>

        <p><strong>Read <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:16-18">John 5:16-18</span></strong>. Why was Jesus persecuted for His action on the Sabbath?</p>

        <p><strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:18">John 5:18</span></strong> can be disturbing because it seems to say that Jesus was breaking the Sabbath. However, a closer look at <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:16-18">John 5:16-18</span></strong> shows that Jesus argues that His “work” on the Sabbath is in line with His relationship to His Father. God does not stop sustaining the universe on the Sabbath. Consequently, Jesus’ Sabbath activity was part of His claim to divinity. The religious leaders persecuted Him on the basis of supposed Sabbath-breaking and a claim to equality with God.</p>

        <p><strong>Read <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:19-47">John 5:19-47</span></strong>. What was Jesus saying in order to help the leaders see Him for who He truly is, a claim so powerfully attested by the miracle He had just done?</p>

        <p>Jesus defends His actions in three steps. First, He explains His intimate relationship with the Father (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:19-30">John 5:19-30</span></strong>). Jesus indicates that He and His Father act in harmony, to the point that Jesus has the power both to judge and to raise the dead (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:25-30">John 5:25-30</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>Second, Jesus calls four “witnesses” in rapid succession to His defense—John the Baptist (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:31-35">John 5:31-35</span></strong>), the miracles Jesus does (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:36">John 5:36</span></strong>), the Father (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:37-38">John 5:37, 38</span></strong>), and the Scriptures (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:39">John 5:39</span></strong>). Each of these “witnesses” gives testimony in favor of Jesus.</p>

        <p>Finally, in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:40-47">John 5:40-47</span></strong>, Jesus sets before His accusers their own condemnation, revealing the contrast between His ministry and their self-seeking. Their condemnation, He says, will come from Moses (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:45-47">John 5:45-47</span></strong>), the one in whom they have set their hopes.</p>

        <p>How can we be careful not to fall into the trap of believing in God, even having correct doctrines, but not surrendering fully to Christ? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.</p>

        <p>“Jesus had given him [the disabled man] no assurance of divine help. The man might have stopped to doubt, and lost his one chance of healing. But he believed Christ’s word, and in acting upon it he received strength.</p>
        <p>“Through the same faith we may receive spiritual healing. By sin we have been severed from the life of God. Our souls are palsied. Of ourselves we are no more capable of living a holy life than was the impotent man capable of walking. . . . Let these desponding, struggling ones look up. The Saviour is bending over the purchase of His blood, saying with inexpressible tenderness and pity, ‘Wilt thou be made whole?’ He bids you arise in health and peace. Do not wait to feel that you are made whole. Believe His word, and it will be fulfilled. Put your will on the side of Christ. Will to serve Him, and in acting upon His word you will receive strength. Whatever may be the evil practice, the master passion which through long indulgence binds both soul and body, Christ is able and longs to deliver. He will impart life to the soul that is ‘dead in trespasses.’ <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Ephesians 2:1">Eph. 2:1</span></strong>. He will set free the captive that is held by weakness and misfortune and the chains of sin.” —Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 203.</p>
        <p>“Jesus repelled the charge of blasphemy. My authority, He said, for doing the work of which you accuse Me, is that I am the Son of God, one with Him in nature, in will, and in purpose.” —The Desire of Ages, p. 208.</p>
        <p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>
        <p>Reflect upon this week’s lesson. Faith was the key that made these healings possible. The leaders, in contrast, revealed the dangers of doubt and unbelief. Why must we not confuse having questions (which we all do) with having doubt? Why are they not the same thing, and why is it important to know the difference between them?</p>
        <p>Look at Thursday’s final question. Why, as Seventh-day Adventists, must we be especially careful about this danger? However important, for instance, knowing and even keeping the right Sabbath day, or knowing about the state of the dead—why do these truths not save us? What does save us, and how?</p>
        <p>Look carefully at John 5:47. How are those today who, for instance, deny the universality of the Flood, or the literal six-day Creation, doing exactly what Jesus warned against here?</p>

        <p><strong>Memory Text:</strong></p>
        <p>“Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:25-26">John 11:25, 26</span></strong>, NKJV).</p>

        <p>The Bible is clear that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son, one with the Father, underived and uncreated. Jesus is the One who created all that was made (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-3">John 1:1-3</span></strong>). Thus, Jesus has always existed; there never was a time when He didn’t exist. Though Jesus came to this world and took upon Himself our humanity, He always kept His divinity. And at specific times, Jesus said and did things that revealed this divinity.</p>

        <p>This truth was important for John, which is why, when recounting some of Jesus’ miracles, John used them to point to Christ’s divinity. Jesus not only said things that revealed His divinity but backed up His words with works that manifested His divinity.</p>

        <p>This week’s lesson looks at three of the greatest signs of Jesus’ divinity. What is striking is that, in every case, some people did not believe the miracle or perceive its significance. For some, it was a time of turning away from Jesus; for others, a time for deepening blindness; and for others, a time to plot Jesus’ death. And for others—a time to believe that Jesus was the Messiah.</p>

        <p>In <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:4-5">John 6:4, 5</span></strong>, the apostle goes out of his way to state that the timing of the feeding of the 5,000 was near the Passover. The Passover was a commemoration of the deliverance of Israel from Egypt. The Passover lamb took the place of the death of the firstborn. This sacrifice symbolized the death of Jesus in our behalf. On the cross, the punishment that we deserved because of our sins fell on Jesus instead. <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 5:7">Christ, our Passover, was indeed slain for us</span></strong>.</p>
        
        <p>“He bore the guilt of transgression, and the hiding of His Father’s face, until His heart was broken and His life crushed out. All this sacrifice was made that sinners might be redeemed.”—Ellen G. White, <i>The Great Controversy</i>, p. 540.</p>

        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:1-14">John 6:1-14</span></strong>. What parallels can be found here between Jesus and Moses? That is, what did Jesus do here that should have reminded the people of the deliverance that their ancestors had received through the ministry of Moses?</p>

        <p>Numerous details of this story place Jesus in parallel to Moses in the Exodus. The time of the Passover (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:4">John 6:4</span></strong>) points to the great deliverance from Egypt. Jesus goes up on a mountain (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:3">John 6:3</span></strong>) as Moses went up Sinai. Jesus tests Philip (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:5-6">John 6:5, 6</span></strong>) as the Israelites were tested in the wilderness. The multiplication of the loaves (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:11">John 6:11</span></strong>) is reminiscent of the manna. The gathering of the leftover food (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:12">John 6:12</span></strong>) harks back to the Israelites’ gathering the manna. Twelve baskets of leftovers are picked up (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:13">John 6:13</span></strong>), the same number as the twelve tribes of Israel. And the people comment that Jesus is the prophet coming into the world (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:14">John 6:14</span></strong>), parallel to the “prophet like Moses” predicted in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deuteronomy 18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span></strong>. All of this points to Jesus as the new Moses—come to deliver His people.</p>

        <p>Thus, John is showing Jesus not only doing signs and wonders but doing signs and wonders that, in their context, should have had special meaning for the Jewish people. Jesus was pointing them, in essence, to His own divinity.</p>

        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Isaiah 53:4-6">Isaiah 53:4-6</span></strong> and <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Peter 2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span></strong>. What great truth do these texts teach about Jesus as the Lamb of God? How does His divinity tie into this truth, and why is this truth the most important truth we can ever know?</p>

        <p>The Judeans were expecting an earthly messiah who would deliver them from the oppression of the Roman Empire. Two of the most difficult things encountered in war are feeding the troops and caring for the wounded and dead. By His miracles, Jesus showed that He could do both.</p>

        <p>But that’s not why Jesus had come, and that wasn’t the purpose of His miracle. Instead, the account of the feeding of the 5,000 provided the opportunity to illustrate that Jesus is the Bread of Life, that God Himself came down from heaven. “<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:35">I am the bread of life</span></strong>,” He said. “<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:35">He who comes to Me shall never hunger</span></strong>” (NKJV).</p>

        <p>This is the first of the seven “I am” statements in the Gospel of John, where “I am” is connected with some predicate (“bread of life,” <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:35">John 6:35</span></strong>; “light of the world,” <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:12">John 8:12</span></strong>; “door,” <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:7, 9">John 10:7, 9</span></strong>; “Good Shepherd,” <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:11, 14">John 10:11, 14</span></strong>; “resurrection and the life,” <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:25">John 11:25</span></strong>; “the way, the truth, and the life,” <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:6">John 14:6</span></strong>; “true vine,” <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 15:1, 5">John 15:1, 5</span></strong>). Each of these points to an important truth about Jesus. The “I am” statements point back to Exodus 3, where God presents Himself to Moses as the great I AM (compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:58">John 8:58</span></strong>). Jesus is that great I AM.</p>

        <p>But the people missed all this.</p>

        <p>“Their dissatisfied hearts queried why, if Jesus could perform so many wondrous works as they had witnessed, could He not give health, strength, and riches to all His people, free them from their oppressors, and exalt them to power and honor? The fact that He claimed to be the Sent of God, and yet refused to be Israel’s king, was a mystery which they could not fathom. His refusal was misinterpreted. Many concluded that He dared not assert His claims because He Himself doubted as to the divine character of His mission. Thus they opened their hearts to unbelief, and the seed which Satan had sown bore fruit of its kind, in misunderstanding and defection.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 385.</p>

        <p>They were looking for material benefit instead of truth that endures to eternal life. This is a trap that we all potentially face if we are not careful.</p>

        <p>How can we avoid getting caught up in material things at the expense of the spiritual?</p>

    text: `
        <p>The disciples made a connection between sickness and sin. A number of Old Testament passages point in that direction (compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Exodus 20:5">Exodus 20:5</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="2 Kings 5:15-27">2 Kings 5:15-27</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="2 Kings 15:5">2 Kings 15:5</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="2 Chronicles 26:16-21">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</span></strong>), but the story of Job should have led to caution about whether such a connection always occurred.</p>

        <p>Jesus sets the matter straight, not denying any connection between sin and suffering but, in this case, pointing to a higher purpose: that God would be glorified by the healing. The account contains certain affinities to the Creation story, that of God’s forming the first man from the dust of the ground (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 2:7">Genesis 2:7</span></strong>), just as Jesus makes clay to provide the blind man what was missing from the womb.</p>

        <p>In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, miracle stories follow a common pattern: an expression of the problem, the bringing of the individual to Jesus, the cure, and recognition of the cure with praise to God.</p>

        <p>In the story in John 9, this sequence is completed in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:7">John 9:7</span></strong>. But typical of John, the significance of the miracle becomes the much wider point of discussion, leading to a long interaction between the healed man and the religious leaders. This striking discussion revolves around two intertwined contrasting pairs of concepts—sin/works of God and blindness/sight.</p>

        <p>The narrator does not tell the reader until <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:14">John 9:14</span></strong> that Jesus did this healing on the Sabbath, which, according to tradition and not Scripture, violated the Sabbath. And thus, He was counted as a Sabbath breaker by the Pharisees. Their conclusion was that He was not from God because they maintained that “He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others found it troubling that a sinner could do such signs (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:16">John 9:16</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>The discussion is far from over, but already a division appears. The blind man is becoming more and more clear about who Jesus is, but the religious leaders are becoming more and more confused or blind as to His real identity.</p>

        <p>What should this story tell us about the dangers of being so blinded by our own beliefs and traditions that we can miss important truths right before our own eyes?</p>

    title: "The Healing of the Blind Man: Part 2",
    lesson: "2",
    text: `
        <p>This long section of <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:17-34">John 9:17-34</span></strong> is the only portion of John where Jesus is not the main actor on the stage, though He is certainly the subject of discussion. Just as the question of sin started the story (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:2">John 9:2</span></strong>), the Pharisees think Jesus is a sinner because He healed on the Sabbath (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:16, 24">John 9:16, 24</span></strong>), and they will slander the healed man as “born in utter sin” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:34">John 9:34</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>A curious reversal occurs. The blind man comes to see more and more, not just physically but spiritually, as he is growing in his appreciation for Jesus and believing more strongly in Him. The Pharisees, in contrast, become more and more blind in their understanding, first being divided over Jesus (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:16">John 9:16</span></strong>) and then not knowing where He came from (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:29">John 9:29</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, his recounting of this miracle gives John the opportunity to tell us who Jesus is. The theme of signs in <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9">John 9</span></strong> intersects with several other themes in the Gospel. John reaffirms that Jesus is the Light of the world (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:5">John 9:5</span></strong>; compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:12">John 8:12</span></strong>). The story also deals with Jesus’ mysterious origin. Who is He, where is He from, what is His mission (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:12, 29">John 9:12, 29</span></strong>; compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:14">John 1:14</span></strong>)? The figure of Moses, who is referenced in previous miracle accounts, also appears in this chapter (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:28, 29">John 9:28, 29</span></strong>; compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:45, 46">John 5:45, 46</span></strong> and <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:32">John 6:32</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>Finally, there is the theme of the response of the crowd. Some love darkness rather than light, while others respond in faith (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:16-18, 35-41">John 9:16-18, 35-41</span></strong>; compare with <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:9-16">John 1:9-16</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:16-21">John 3:16-21</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:60-71">John 6:60-71</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>So scary here is the spiritual blindness of the religious leaders. A once-blind beggar can declare, “ ‘Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:32, 33">John 9:32, 33</span></strong>, NKJV). And yet the religious leaders, the spiritual guides of the nation, the ones who should have been the first to recognize Jesus and accept Him as the Messiah—they, despite all the powerful evidence, cannot see it, or they don’t really want to see it. What a powerful warning about how our hearts can deceive us!</p>

        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 1:26-29">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</span></strong>. How does what Paul writes in these verses fit with John's account above and how does the same principle apply even now?</p>

    title: "The Resurrection of Lazarus",
    lesson: "2",
    text: `
        <p><strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11">John 11</span></strong> is filled with sadness—the sad news of a dear friend’s illness (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:1-3">John 11:1-3</span></strong>); the weeping over his death (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:19,31,33">John 11:19, 31, 33</span></strong>); the sisters’ lament that Lazarus would not have died if Jesus had been present (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:21,32">John 11:21, 32</span></strong>); and Jesus’ own tears (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:35">John 11:35</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>But Jesus had delayed two days before starting His journey to Lazarus (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:6">John 11:6</span></strong>), even indicating that He was glad that He had not gone earlier (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:14,15">John 11:14, 15</span></strong>). This action was not from any cold-heartedness. Rather, it was to reveal God’s glory.</p>

        <p>By the time we get to <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:17-27">John 11:17-27</span></strong>, Lazarus had been dead four days. After four days, his body would already be rotting and, as Martha said, “ ‘Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:39">John 11:39</span></strong>, NKJV). No doubt, Jesus’ delay only helped to make the miracle that followed even more astonishing. To raise a rotting corpse? What more proof could Jesus have given that indeed He was God Himself?</p>

        <p>And, as God, as the One who created life to begin with—Jesus had power over death. Thus, Jesus uses this opportunity, that of Lazarus’s death, to reveal a crucial truth about Himself. “ ‘I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die’ ” (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:25-26">John 11:25, 26</span></strong>, ESV).</p>

        <p>Read <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:38-44">John 11:38-44</span></strong>. What did Jesus do that supported His claim?</p>

        <p>Just as Jesus showed He is the Light of the world (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:12">John 8:12</span></strong>, <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:5">John 9:5</span></strong>) by giving the blind man sight (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:7">John 9:7</span></strong>), so here He raises Lazarus from the dead (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:43-44">John 11:43, 44</span></strong>), demonstrating that He is the Resurrection and the Life (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:25">John 11:25</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>This miracle, more than any other, points to Jesus as the Life-Giver, as God Himself. It provides strong support for John’s theme that Jesus is the divine Son of God and that, by believing, we can have life through Him (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:30-31">John 20:30, 31</span></strong>).</p>

        <p>However, by the time we get to the end of this incredible story (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:45-54">John 11:45-54</span></strong>), in which many who saw believed (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:45">John 11:45</span></strong>), a powerful but sad irony unfolds. Jesus shows that He can bring the dead back to life, and yet, these men think that they can stop Him by killing Him? What an example of the foibles of humanity in contrast to the wisdom and power of God!</p>

        <p><strong>Read Ellen G. White,</strong> “The Crisis in Galilee,” pp. 383-394; “‘Lazarus, Come Forth,’” pp. 524-536; and “Priestly Plottings,” pp. 537-542, in <em>The Desire of Ages</em>.</p>

        <p>“The life of Christ that gives life to the world is in His word. It was by His word that Jesus healed disease and cast out demons; by His word He stilled the sea, and raised the dead; and the people bore witness that His word was with power. He spoke the word of God, as He had spoken through all the prophets and teachers of the Old Testament. The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ, and the Saviour desired to fix the faith of His followers on the word. When His visible presence should be withdrawn, the word must be their source of power. Like their Master, they were to live ‘by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.’ Matthew 4:4.</p>

        <p>“As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual life is sustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life from God’s word for himself. As we must eat for ourselves in order to receive nourishment, so we must receive the word for ourselves. We are not to obtain it merely through the medium of another’s mind. We should carefully study the Bible, asking God for the aid of the Holy Spirit, that we may understand His word.”—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 390.</p>

        <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
        
        <p>This week we looked at Jesus feeding the 5,000, healing a man blind from birth, and then raising Lazarus from the dead. In each case, Jesus provided powerful evidence for His divinity. Yet, these miracles, as amazing as they were, created division. Some responded with faith, others with doubt. What does this teach us about how, even in the face of powerful evidence, people can still choose to reject God?</p>
        
        <p>These stories all point toward Christ as the divine Son of God. Why is His divinity so important to faith in Jesus as the Savior?</p>
        
        <p>Look again at <strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 1:26-29">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</span></strong>. In what ways in the twenty-first century do we see this same principle at work? What are some of the “foolish things” that Christians believe, things that the “wise according to the flesh” mock and reject? What do we believe that also “put to shame” the “things that are mighty”?</p>

        <h3>By Andrew McChesney</h3>
        <p>Pablo had never heard of Seventh-day Adventists. A leader among the Sikuani indigenous people in Colombia, he was far from home when he was invited to a Sabbath worship service.</p>
        <p>“This Saturday, we will have a meeting,” someone said. “Come!”</p>
        <p>Pablo went to the morning service and saw that people studied the Bible. He returned for the afternoon service and heard people asking Bible questions. He was amazed that Cristian Camilo, the 25-year-old missionary who had led the morning service, answered every question from the Bible.</p>
        <p>When he got a chance, Pablo had his own question. “What do I need to do to become a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“We can start Bible studies,” Cristian said.</p>
        <p>He gave Pablo a set of 20 Bible lessons in Pablo’s own native Sikuani language. Pablo was pleased and asked for lessons for the rest of his family.</p>
        <p>Cristian gave Pablo a Bible and promised to travel to his community with lessons for his family.</p>
        <p>Cristian was responsible for a large territory, and three months passed before he was able to visit Pablo. He traveled with two Sikuani Adventists because he couldn’t find Pablo’s rural community without their help.</p>
        <p>Pablo welcomed Cristian and announced that he had finished studying the 20 Bible lessons. He said he also had given Bible studies to his family and the rest of the community, and 15 people were ready to be baptized.</p>
        <p>Cristian, who had arrived on a Friday, spent the rest of the day answering Bible questions and checking whether the people were ready for baptism. When the sun set, he led an evening worship program.</p>
        <p>On Sabbath morning, Cristian led the community in a divine worship service. Afterward, one man said, “There’s a lake over there.” Another said, “We want to be baptized right now!” That Sabbath, five people were baptized: Pablo, his mother, his two brothers, and a sister-in-law.</p>
        <p>Today, Pablo is giving Bible studies to his people.</p>
        <p>“There are many people who are hungry for the Word of God in Pablo’s community,” Cristian said. “Like Pablo, there are many people who are waiting to be reached.”</p>

        <p>Week one dealt with the end of the book of John, which explained why he wrote his Gospel. 
        This week’s lesson returns to the beginning of the Gospel, where John sets forth the direction that he, inspired by the Holy Spirit, intends to take the reader. 
        In the first words and paragraphs of their writing, New Testament writers often present the themes that they intend to cover. 
        So does John, whose themes are presented as part of a grand cosmic sweep that depicts overriding truths about Jesus Christ—truths that reach back to even before Creation.</p>

        <p>This presentation, at the opening of the book, gives readers, who already know that Jesus is the Messiah, an advantage that the characters in the book itself did not have. 
        The reader can clearly see the grand themes that the evangelist returns to as he tells the story of Jesus. 
        These great themes are placed within the historical period of Jesus’ earthly life.</p>

        <p>This week’s lesson will begin with the Prologue (<strong><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span></strong>) 
        and summarize its major themes. These themes will then be looked at in other places in John’s Gospel, as well.</p>

        <p><strong>Read <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-5">John 1:1-5</span>.</strong> What do these words reveal about the Word, Jesus Christ?</p>

        <p>The Gospel of John begins with this amazing thought: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>). 
        This one beautiful sentence contains a depth of thought that we can barely grasp.</p>

        <p>First, the evangelist alludes to the Creation story in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>, “In the beginning.” 
        The Word was already there before the beginning of the universe. Thus, John affirms Jesus’ eternal existence.</p>

        <p>Next, “And the Word was with God.” In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>, John indicates that He is “in the bosom of the Father.” 
        No matter how we may try to envision what this exactly means, one thing is sure: Jesus and the Father are intimately close.</p>

        <p>And then, he says, “And the Word was God.” But how can the Word be with God and at the same time be God? 
        The answer is found in the Greek. Greek has a definite article, “the,” but no indefinite article, “a/an.” 
        What’s important for us, then, is that the Greek definite article, “the,” points to particularity, some particular object or person.</p>

        <p>In the phrase “the Word was with God,” the term “God” has the definite article, thus, pointing to a particular individual, the Father. 
        And the Word was with the Father. In the phrase, “and the Word was God,” the term “God” does not have the article, 
        which, in this setting, points to the characteristics of divinity. Jesus is God—not the Father, but He is still the divine Son of God, 
        the second Person of the Godhead.</p>

        <p>The apostle verifies this understanding, for <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:3-4">John 1:3, 4</span> says that Jesus is the Creator of all things created. 
        Anything that once didn’t exist but then came into existence did so only through Jesus, the Creator God.</p>

        <blockquote><em>“From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with the Father; He was ‘the image of God,’ the image of His greatness and majesty, ‘the outshining of His glory.’ ”—Ellen G. White, 
        <strong>The Desire of Ages</strong>, p. 19.</em></blockquote>

        <p>Why is the full deity of Christ such an important part of our theology? 
        What would we lose if Jesus were, in any way, a mere created being? 
        Bring your answer to class on Sabbath, and be prepared to discuss why Christ’s eternal deity is so important to our faith.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-3">John 1:1-3</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:14">14</span>. <strong>What are these verses telling us that Jesus, God Himself, did—and why is this truth the most important truth that we could ever know?</strong></p>

        <p>John starts his Gospel not with the name “Jesus” or His role as Messiah/Christ but with the term <em>logos</em>. 
        Around the time John wrote, various philosophies used the term <em>logos</em> to refer to the rational structure of the universe, 
        or to refer to the idea of logic and reason themselves.</p>

        <p>Also, the teaching of the influential ancient philosopher Plato had divided reality into two realms. 
        One is the heavenly and immutable realm, where absolute perfection exists. The other is the realm here—perishable, 
        changing, a very imperfect representation of the perfect realm above, wherever it supposedly existed. 
        (Plato never answered that question.) Some philosophies identified the <em>logos</em> as some abstract intermediary 
        between the eternal forms and the perishable, earthly forms here.</p>

        <p>John uses the term in a completely different manner. He maintains that the truth, the <em>logos</em>, is not some ethereal 
        and abstract concept floating between heaven and earth. The <em>logos</em> is a person: Jesus Christ, who became flesh and 
        dwelt among us (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>).</p>

        <p>For John, the <em>logos</em> is the Word of God. More important, God communicated; that is, He revealed Himself to humanity 
        in the most radical way: God became one of us.</p>

        <p>In the Gospel of John, the <em>logos</em> represents the eternal God, who enters time and space, who speaks, acts, 
        and interrelates with humans on a personal level. The eternal God became a human being, one of us.</p>

        <p>In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>, the apostle indicates that the <em>logos</em> “became flesh and dwelt among us” (NKJV). 
        The underlying Greek word, translated dwelt, means to pitch a tent. John is alluding to Exodus 25:8, where God told the Israelites to make a sanctuary, 
        a tent structure, so that He could dwell in their midst. In the same way, in the Incarnation, Jesus, the divine Son of God, stepped into human flesh, 
        veiling His glory so that people could come in contact with Him.</p>

        <p>Dwell on the implications of what John has written here. God Himself, the Creator, became a human being, one of us, 
        and lived here among us. (We haven’t even gotten to His dying for us yet!) What does this tell us about the reality of God’s love for humanity? 
        Why should we draw so much comfort from this amazing truth?</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:9-13">John 1:9-13</span>. 
        What harsh reality is John depicting here about how people respond to Jesus?</p>

        <p>The Prologue, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span>, describes not only who Jesus Christ, 
        the Word (logos), is but also how people in the world related to Him. In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:9">John 1:9</span>, 
        He is called the true Light, who enlightens every person coming into the world. That light illumines the world, 
        making it understandable. As C. S. Lewis puts it, “I believe in Christianity as I believe that the Sun has risen, 
        not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” —“Is Theology Poetry?” (n. p.: Samizdat University Press, 2014), 
        p. 15, originally presented in 1944.</p>

        <p>Also, look at the implications of what <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:9">John 1:9</span> is saying. 
        Light comes to everyone, but not everyone welcomes the light. As we will see in tomorrow’s study, a major theme in 
        the Gospel of John is how people receive or reject Jesus. That theme begins here. The sad litany is that the Messiah 
        came to His own people, the people of Israel, and many did not receive Him as the Messiah.</p>

        <p>In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 9-11">Romans 9-11</span>, Paul deals with the same tragic theme, 
        of many Jews rejecting Jesus. But Paul doesn’t end on a negative note, saying in fact that many Jews, along with Gentiles, 
        will accept Jesus as their Messiah. Indeed, he warns the Gentiles not to boast against the Jews. “For if you were cut 
        out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how 
        much more will these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 11:24">Rom. 11:24, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>In a similar vein, John says that all who do receive Jesus as their Savior will become the children of God. 
        This happens by believing on His name. (See <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:12-13">John 1:12, 13</span>.)</p>

        <p>Here is the connection between the prologue and the conclusion of the Gospel. In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:31">John 20:31</span>, 
        the apostle presents why he wrote—that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing 
        you may have life by His name. Thus, the introduction and conclusion form a kind of unity. They are related concepts 
        that enclose all that occurs between them. This linkage points to the overarching goal of the Gospel of John—that 
        people will be saved by believing on Jesus Christ as their Savior.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:16-21">John 3:16-21</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 9:35-41">John 9:35-41</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:36-46">John 12:36-46</span>. 
        How do these texts repeat the theme of belief/unbelief found in the prologue?</p>

        <p>In John’s Gospel, humanity seems to be divided into two overarching groups: 
        those who believe in Jesus and accept Him as the Messiah and those who, having the opportunity to believe, choose not to.</p>

        <p>Eleven of the disciples are in the first group, as are others such as Nicodemus (who comes to faith slowly), 
        the woman at the well, and the man born blind. In the second group are Pharisees and high priests, people 
        at the miracle of feeding the 5,000, and even one of the disciples, Judas.</p>

        <p>It is interesting that the noun <em>pistis</em> (Greek for faith/belief) never appears in the Gospel of John. 
        However, the verb <em>pisteuō</em> (believe) appears 98 times, compared to 241 times total in the entire New Testament! 
        This verb is, indeed, a very big theme in John. This use of the verb instead of the noun may point to a very active 
        sense of becoming a Christian. Being a believer in Jesus is something that we do, and this is expressed in how we live 
        and not just in a set of beliefs. As we know, the devil believes in Jesus, as well (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="James 2:19">James 2:19</span>).</p>

        <p>In John, the major difference between the two groups is the way that they relate to Jesus. Believers, or those who come 
        to believe, have an openness toward Him, even when He confronts or rebukes them. They come to Jesus and do not run away. 
        He is the Light that shines on them. And by faith, by believing, they become the children of God.</p>

        <p>Unbelievers, on the other hand, typically come to Jesus to fight with Him. They are characterized by those who love 
        darkness rather than light. They find His sayings hard to accept or they see Him breaking old traditions and not fulfilling 
        their expectations. They stand in judgment on Him rather than letting His light measure and judge them. This attitude, of 
        course, had been seen again and again in the religious leaders, who ideally, as the spiritual guides of the nation, 
        should have been the first ones to have accepted Jesus.</p>

        <p>In what ways do you live out your faith in Jesus, as opposed to merely holding an intellectual assent to Him as the Messiah? 
        Why is it important to know the difference? (See <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 7:21-23">Matthew 7:21-23</span>.)</p>

    text: `
        <p><strong>Read John 17:1-5.</strong> What did Jesus mean when He said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you” (ESV)?</p>

        <p>Yesterday’s study looked at the earthly, human storyline of the Gospel of John with its clash and interplay 
        between people, always revolving around who Jesus is and what He is doing. Today’s study focuses on the divine, 
        cosmic storyline, also found in John.</p>

        <p>The Prologue begins with that cosmic storyline. Jesus is presented as the divine Son of God, the Creator of the universe. 
        Again, anything that once didn’t exist but came into existence did so only through Jesus. “All things were made through Him, 
        and without Him nothing was made that was made” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:3">John 1:3</span>, NKJV). 
        But it goes on to note the glory of His becoming a human being in the Incarnation (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>). 
        John uses the terms glory (doxa: brightness, splendor, fame, honor) and glorify (doxazō: to praise, honor, extol, glorify) 
        to speak both of receiving honor from humans and of receiving honor or glory from God.</p>

        <p>In John, the idea of glorifying Jesus is linked to the concept of His hour; that is, the time of His death 
        (compare with <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 2:4">John 2:4</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 7:30">John 7:30</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:20">John 8:20</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:23-27">John 12:23-27</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:1">John 13:1</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 16:32">John 16:32</span>, and 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 17:1">John 17:1</span>). The cross is His hour of glory.</p>

        <p>This idea is quite paradoxical because crucifixion was the most shameful and humiliating way of execution 
        in the ancient Roman world. This incredible contrast, God on a cross, illustrates the intertwining of the human 
        story plot with the divine.</p>

        <p>On the human level, Jesus died in agony, a despised criminal in weakness crying out, “ ‘My God, My God, 
        why have You forsaken Me?’ ” This human, dark side of the cross is particularly presented in Matthew and Mark 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 15:34">Mark 15:34</span>, NKJV).</p>

        <p>But the glorious side of the cross is especially presented in Luke and John 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 23:32-47">Luke 23:32-47</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:25-30">John 19:25-30</span>). It is a place of salvation, of mercy, 
        and where the Son of God gives Himself to His Father.</p>

        <p>How ironic: God’s greatest glory is revealed in His greatest shame—bearing the sins of the world in Himself.</p>

        <p>Think about what it means that it took such a drastic thing, God Himself on the cross, to save us from sin. 
        What should this tell us about just how bad sin really is?</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“The Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God, existed from eternity, a distinct person, yet one with the Father. 
            He was the surpassing glory of heaven. He was the commander of the heavenly intelligences, and the adoring homage of 
            the angels was received by Him as His right. This was no robbery of God [<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Proverbs 8:22-27">Proverbs 8:22-27</span> quoted].</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“There are light and glory in the truth that Christ was One with the Father before the foundation of the world was laid. 
            This is the light shining in a dark place, making it resplendent with divine, original glory. This truth, infinitely mysterious 
            in itself, explains other mysterious and otherwise unexplainable truths, while it is enshrined in light unapproachable and incomprehensible.”

            Christ must be revealed to the sinner as the Saviour dying for the sins of the world; and as we behold the Lamb of God upon the cross of Calvary, 
            the mystery of redemption begins to unfold to our minds and the goodness of God leads us to repentance. In dying for sinners, Christ manifested 
            a love that is incomprehensible; and as the sinner beholds this love, it softens the heart, impresses the mind, and inspires contrition in the soul. 
            . . . Whenever they [people] make an effort to reform, from a sincere desire to do right, it is the power of Christ that is drawing them. 
            An influence of which they are unconscious works upon the soul, and the conscience is quickened, and the outward life is amended. 
            And as Christ draws them to look upon His cross, to behold Him whom their sins have pierced, the commandment comes home to the conscience.”

            <li>Why would John start out talking about Jesus in His role as Creator? What does this tell us about the importance of Creation in all theology?

    <h3>By Andrew McChesney</h3>
        <p>A Native American man walked onto the construction site.</p>
        <p>“What are you guys building here?” he asked, watching volunteers place log walls on the concrete foundation of the All Nations Center in Wapato, a town in the U.S. state of Washington. “Another church?” he said, shaking his head. “You guys don’t even know what day of the week to keep.”</p>
        <p>A construction leader, Jeff Weijohn, struck up a conversation with the man, who had never heard of Seventh-day Adventists. The man thought that the new church would be open for worship on Sunday, but he believed that the Creator should be worshiped on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Jeff was surprised. “It was the first time that I heard that some Native Americans have a history of Sabbath keeping,” Jeff said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Later, Jeff sought clarification from a historian familiar with Native American history. The historian confirmed that one or two tribes on the Yakama Indian Reservation, where Wapato is located, traditionally believed that the seventh day was the Creator’s day and worshiped Him on that day.</p>
        <p>The realization that God had planted a Sabbath seed in Native hearts energized Jeff and his wife, Terri, in mission outreach to Native Americans.</p>
        <p>The outreach program got its start with the help of a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering in 1990. A highlight of the program is the All Nations Center, which opened in 2001 and was designed as a multipurpose building. It has a worship corner, where people gather to worship on Sabbath mornings; a food area, where meals are served and an annual Mother’s Day brunch draws 300 to 400 people; and volleyball and basketball courts, where up to 200 children and their parents come for game nights. The center also offers day camps, Vacation Bible Schools, and after-school tutoring.</p>
        <p>Native Americans and others can lease space. “One reason we built the facility was because the community had nowhere to meet,” Jeff said.</p>
        <p>In a notable instance, a Native American leader chose the site over a native-owned casino to conduct health seminars, saying gambling was destroying his people.</p>
        <p>“It was quite a testimony that he didn’t want anything to do with the casino,” Jeff said.</p>
        <p>The center’s culturally sensitive concept has proven so successful that it has been replicated elsewhere, including in Canada, he said.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings that continue to make a difference. Pray that God uses them to proclaim the everlasting gospel to every tribe, tongue, people, and nation.</p>

        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:3">John 3:3, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>No question, Jesus provided people with powerful scriptural evidence to back up the claims that 
        He had been making about Himself, including “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me

        the nobleman’s son; restoring the man at the pool of Bethesda; giving sight to the one blind from birth; 
        raising Lazarus from the dead. The evangelist calls on a variety of events, and people—Jew, Gentile, rich, 
        poor, male, female, rulers, commoners, educated, and uneducated—to bear witness to who Jesus is.</p>

        <p>John points even to the witness of the Father Himself, and to Scripture, all giving evidence of Jesus’ identity.</p>

        Andrew and Simon Peter, Philip and Nathanael, and a most unexpected witness, the Pharisee Nicodemus.

        <p>As last week’s lesson illustrated, the Gospel of John begins with Jesus Christ, the Word, in His eternal 
        existence before Creation. But in that same prologue, John the Baptist appears as a witness to Jesus. 
        Some Jews in Jesus’ time expected two messiahs, one priestly and the other royal. 
        John clearly teaches that John the Baptist did not claim to be one of these messiahs but, rather, was 
        a witness to the one true Messiah.</p>

        <p><strong>Read</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:19-23">John 1:19-23</span>. 
        How did John the Baptist explain his ministry and mission?</p>

        <p>The religious leaders sent priests and Levites to ask John who he was. With Messianic expectations high 
        in Judea, it was important for John the Baptist to clarify his relationship to those expectations. He was not 
        the Light, but he was sent from God to bear witness to the Light and to prepare for the coming of the Messiah 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:6-8">John 1:6-8</span>). That’s why he answered them as plainly as 
        he could, saying: “I am not the Christ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:20">John 1:20</span>).</p>

        <p>Also, John baptized with water, but Christ would baptize with the Spirit 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:26,33">John 1:26, 33</span>). John was not worthy to loosen 
        Jesus’ sandal strap 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:27">John 1:27</span>). Christ was preferred before John because 
        He was before John 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:30">John 1:30</span>). Jesus was the Son of God, and John merely 
        pointed to Him 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:34">John 1:34</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>Read</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Isaiah 40:1-5">Isaiah 40:1-5</span> 
        and <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:23">John 1:23</span>. How does John use these verses?</p>

        <p>In the days of rutted and rock-filled roads, servants were sometimes sent ahead of the king to level the 
        surfaces of roadways and to take out sharp turns so as to smooth the way of the king. So, in fulfillment 
        of prophecy, John came in order to prepare the hearts of the people for Jesus.</p>

        <p><strong>In what way should we, as Seventh-day Adventists, do the same kind of ministry as did John the 
        Baptist? What are the parallels?</strong></p>

    text: `
        <p>The Hebrew nation was looking for a Messiah who would deliver them from Rome. The goal of the Gospel of John was to change their 
        understanding of the Messiah so that they could recognize in Jesus the fulfillment of the prophecies regarding the coming King. 
        The Messiah would not be an earthly ruler. He came to fulfill all the Old Testament promises concerning Himself, which include 
        His self-sacrifice in behalf of the world, and to renew the relationship between God and His people.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:29-37">John 1:29-37</span>. What proclamation does John the Baptist 
        make about Jesus? What image does he use to depict Him, and why is it so significant in understanding who Jesus was and what His mission would be?</p>

        <p>The statement of the Baptist regarding Jesus as the Lamb of God supports the purpose of John’s Gospel, which is to bring about 
        a renewed understanding of the work and nature of the Messiah. Jesus would, indeed, be the fulfillment of the promise of the sacrificial system, 
        going back to the promise of the Redeemer first given in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>.</p>

        <p>“When at the baptism of Jesus, John pointed to Him as the Lamb of God, a new light was shed upon the Messiah’s work. The prophet’s mind was 
        directed to the words of Isaiah, ‘He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter.’ 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Isaiah 53:7">Isaiah 53:7</span>).”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 136.</p>

        and <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Peter 2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>. How do these verses help us understand the role of Jesus as “the Lamb of God”?</p>

        <p>However much more John the Baptist needed to know about the ministry of Jesus, he was certain that Jesus was the promised Messiah, 
        the One who had come in fulfillment of prophecy.</p>

        <p><em>Consider deeply Jesus’ title as “the Lamb of God.” What images does it bring to mind, and how does its linkage to the Old Testament

        <p>Two disciples of John the Baptist were standing with him when Jesus walked by. 
        John declared, “ ‘Behold the Lamb of God!’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:36">John 1:36, NKJV</span>). 
        The two disciples had listened to John’s message about the Christ, who would fulfill the Old Testament prophecies 
        about the coming Messiah. The disciples left John to follow Jesus, recognizing that Jesus was greater than John the Baptist 
        and that He was the fulfillment of John’s message.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:35-39">John 1:35-39</span>. 
        What did these two disciples do after hearing John’s witness about Jesus?</p>

        <p>Desiring to be with Jesus, the two spent the day with Him. Who knows what amazing things they had learned 
        and experienced then!</p>

        <p>They must have been great things because, before long, their desire was to share their experience with others. 
        Andrew, one of the two disciples, immediately found his brother, Simon, and said, “ ‘We have found the Messiah’ 
        (which is translated, the Christ)” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:41">John 1:41, NKJV</span>). 
        When Andrew brought his brother to Jesus, Jesus immediately showed that He knew him, saying, “ ‘You are Simon the son of Jonah. 
        You shall be called Cephas’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:42">John 1:42, NKJV</span>). 
        Jesus knew and understood Peter. That Jesus knows a person is a motif of the Gospel of John. 
        (See, for example, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 2:24-25">John 2:24, 25</span>.)</p>

        <p>“If John and Andrew had possessed the unbelieving spirit of the priests and rulers, they would not have been found 
        as learners at the feet of Jesus. They would have come to Him as critics, to judge His words. . . . But not so did these 
        first disciples. They had responded to the Holy Spirit's call in the preaching of John the Baptist. Now they recognized 
        the voice of the heavenly Teacher. . . . A divine illumination was shed upon the teaching of the Old Testament Scriptures. 
        The many-sided themes of truth stood out in new light.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 139.</p>

        <p>The entire emphasis of the Gospel of John is to bring to light who Jesus is so that this good news may be shared with the world.</p>

        What did Philip’s message reveal about his faith in Jesus already?</p>

        <p>Philip was from Bethsaida, as were Andrew and Peter. He found his friend, Nathanael, and told him about Jesus. 
        John the Baptist had called Jesus “the Lamb of God.” Andrew had told Peter that he had found “the Messiah.” 
        But Philip calls Jesus the one Moses and the prophets wrote about and adds the name “Jesus of Nazareth.” 
        His reference to Nazareth sets off a sharp reaction from his friend.</p>

        <p>Nathanael seems to have been prejudiced against the little town of Nazareth. Surely a king would not come from 
        such a wayside location. Prejudice easily blinds the eyes from seeing people for what they are really worth. 
        Philip seems to have recognized, possibly from previous conversations with Nathanael, that the proper way to deal 
        with prejudice is not some exalted philosophical or theological argumentation but rather to invite the individual 
        to experience the truth personally for themselves. He simply said, “Come and see.” And that is exactly what Nathanael 
        did. He went and saw.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:47-51">John 1:47-51</span>. 
        How did Jesus convince Nathanael of who He was, and what was Nathanael’s response?</p>

        <p>Missing between verse 46 and verse 47 is the crucial detail of just how Nathanael responded to Philip’s invitation. 
        He got up and went to see, however. His friendship with Philip was stronger than his prejudice, and his life would 
        be changed from that moment on.</p>

        <p>Jesus says nice words about Nathanael, calling him an Israelite in whom there is no deceit 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:47">John 1:47</span>), a great contrast from what Nathanael had said about 
        Jesus (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:46">John 1:46</span>). Nathanael responds with surprise because he 
        had not met Jesus before.</p>

        <p>Then Jesus refers to seeing him under a fig tree, and this small statement convinces Nathanael. 
        Jesus, by divine insight, had seen Nathanael praying, searching for truth under that tree 
        (see Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 140, 141). Nathanael then makes an exalted confession, 
        calling Jesus Rabbi, the Son of God, and the King of Israel. Note how this seemingly small revelation leads 
        to a grand confession of faith.</p>

        How does the testimony of Nicodemus support the theme of the Gospel of John?</p>

        <p>Nicodemus was a respected teacher in Israel and a wealthy member of the Sanhedrin. His testimony plays an important part in 
        John’s Gospel for several reasons. He referred to Jesus as “Rabbi” and pointed to the signs that Jesus performed as evidence 
        of His divine mission. Hence, even before Nicodemus realized what he was doing, he was giving evidence in support of the 
        Messiahship of Jesus.</p>

        <p>Nicodemus viewed the signs themselves as evidence of Jesus’ divine calling but did not see them as pointing to Jesus 
        as the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah. So, Nicodemus came with some doubt; he did not 
        yet at this point recognize Jesus as the Christ.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:3-21">John 3:3-21</span>. What did Jesus say to Nicodemus 
        to show that He could see right through him?</p>

        <p>Jesus knows the heart of each individual. His response to Nicodemus may seem abrupt, but He goes directly to the issue. 
        Though the Jews believed that Gentiles needed to be converted, many didn’t understand that they, too, the chosen people, 
        needed a conversion experience. No one is born saved, regardless of their nationality or the church that they were raised in.</p>

        <p>Without question, the Jews’ wonderful heritage, going back to Abraham, offered them many distinct advantages 
        (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 3:1-2">Rom. 3:1, 2</span>). But, in and of itself, that was not enough. 
        Jesus told Nicodemus the unthinkable—that he, a teacher and ruler in Israel, must be born again from above!</p>

        <p>Jesus then confronted Nicodemus with his own spiritual ignorance: “ ‘Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:10">John 3:10, NKJV</span>). How could you, an exalted teacher, not know this? 
        The rebuke must have been stunning.</p>

        <p>Despite whatever questions he had regarding Jesus then, Nicodemus later took His side with the followers of Jesus 
        (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:39">John 19:39</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>What does it mean to be “born again,” and why would Jesus put such emphasis on it?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> Ellen G. White, “Nicodemus,” pp. 167-177, in <em>The Desire of Ages</em>.</p>

        <p>Nicodemus “searched the Scriptures in a new way, not for the discussion of a theory, but in order to receive life for the soul. 
        He began to see the kingdom of heaven as he submitted himself to the leading of the Holy Spirit. . . .</p>

        <p>“Through faith we receive the grace of God; but faith is not our Saviour. It earns nothing. It is the hand by which we lay hold 
        upon Christ, and appropriate His merits, the remedy for sin. . . . Repentance comes from Christ as truly as does pardon.</p>

        <p>“How, then, are we to be saved? ‘As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,’ so the Son of man has been lifted up, 
        and everyone who has been deceived and bitten by the serpent may look and live. ‘Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.’ 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>). The light shining from the cross reveals the love of God. His love is drawing us to Himself. 
        If we do not resist this drawing, we shall be led to the foot of the cross in repentance for the sins that have crucified the Saviour. 
        Then the Spirit of God through faith produces a new life in the soul. The thoughts and desires are brought into obedience to the will of Christ. 
        The heart, the mind, are created anew in the image of Him who works in us to subdue all things to Himself. Then the law of God is written in the mind 
        and heart, and we can say with Christ, ‘I delight to do Thy will, O my God.’ (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Psalm 40:8">Ps. 40:8</span>).” 
        —Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, pp. 175, 176.</p>

        <h3>Discussion Questions:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>John the Baptist came to prepare the way for Jesus. How successful would you judge his ministry to have been, at least from a human perspective? 
            Also, as you think about your answer, ask this important question: How do you define “success” in spiritual things?</li>

            <li>Later on, John the Baptist expressed some sincere doubts (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 11:2-3">Matthew 11:2, 3</span>; 
            <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 7:19">Luke 7:19</span>). What caused his questions, and what can we learn from them about how to be firm in our faith?</li>

            <li>In class, discuss the idea of how someone such as Nicodemus, a leader in the true church, someone who surely had a lot of knowledge, 
            could still be so spiritually ignorant of what really matters. What lessons can we take from his situation?</li>

        <h3>By Andrew McChesney</strong></h3>

        <p>An ambulance rushed 36-year-old Nigora to the hospital in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. She could barely talk. Her arms were numb. 
        She was struggling to swallow. The doctor couldn’t diagnose her condition.</p>

        <p>Nigora grew worse over the next month in the hospital. She couldn’t sleep for more than 15 minutes a day. X-rays 
        showed activity in her brain.</p>

        <p>Then a second doctor said Nigora had a terminal illness. He saw no hope.</p>

        <p>Nigora didn’t believe in Jesus, but she had Seventh-day Adventist neighbors who did. They visited her in intensive care 
        and asked for permission to invite their church pastor to come and pray with her. “No, no,” Nigora said. “I’m not well. I look 
        terrible. Tell him to come when I feel better.”</p>

        <p>But the neighbors insisted. “Let him come and pray for you,” they said.</p>

        <p>Reluctantly, Nigora agreed. A day later, the pastor and his wife came to Nigora’s bed. The pastor read <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Psalm 23">Psalm 23</span>, 
        anointed Nigora’s forehead with oil, and prayed, “Lord, give health to our sister. Give her healing so she can make a full recovery.” 
        Nigora didn’t feel any different after the prayer.</p>

        <p>The next day, the pastor and his wife returned. Again he read from the Bible, anointed her, and prayed. Again Nigora didn’t feel 
        any different. But that night, she was able to sleep for several hours, not just for 15 minutes.</p>

        <p>The third day, the pastor and his wife returned. Again he read from the Bible, anointed her, and prayed. Again she didn’t feel any 
        different. But that night, she slept the whole night. After that, she slept well every night.</p>

        <p>The pastor and his wife continued to visit. Slowly, Nigora’s speech improved. Her arms and legs began to function. Hospital X-rays 
        showed that her brain activity had returned to normal. The doctor was astonished.</p>

        <p>“It’s impossible that you have recovered, and so quickly,” he said.</p>

        <p>Four months after the pastor began praying, Nigora was driving her car and back at work.</p>

        <p>The woman who hadn’t believed in God credited Him for her recovery.</p>

        <p>“This is a miracle of God,” she said.</p>

        <p>She is glad to have neighbors who cared for her. “I’m very grateful to God that He gave me these kind of friends, who are like 
        family,” she said, speaking slowly but clearly in an interview with Adventist Mission.</p>

        <p>Although Nigora believes in God, she has not given her heart to Him. A discouraging factor may be that many people in Uzbekistan 
        view Seventh-day Adventists as members of a sect. Please pray for Nigora and others like her who have witnessed God’s power in their 
        lives but have yet to make a decision for Him. Nigora is a pseudonym.</p>

        for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world’” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:42">John 4:42, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>Who were the Samaritans? The northern kingdom of Israel had been taken captive by the Assyrians in 722 B.C. 
        To create political stability, the Assyrians dispersed their captives throughout their empire. Likewise, captives 
        from other nations were brought to populate the northern kingdom, and these became the Samaritans, who practiced 
        their own form of Judaism.</p>

        <p>Relations, however, were not good between them and the Jews. For instance, the Samaritans worked against the 
        rebuilding of the temple at the return of the Jews from Babylon. The Samaritans, meanwhile, had built their own 
        temple on Mount Gerizim. But this temple was destroyed by the Jewish ruler John Hyrcanus in 128 B.C.</p>

        <p>At the time of Christ, this animosity continued. The Jews avoided Samaria as much as possible. Though commerce 
        may have gone on, other interaction was taboo. The Jews would not borrow from Samaritans or even receive a favor 
        from them. Within this context, John recounts the encounter between Jesus, the woman at the well, and the people 
        of the Samaritan city of Sychar.</p>

        What was the background issue that led Jesus through Samaria?</p>

        <p>The Pharisees discovered that the disciples of Jesus were baptizing more people than did those of John the Baptist. 
        This situation could create tensions between John’s followers and Jesus’. The disciples of John, quite naturally, 
        were jealous for their master’s reputation and status (compare with <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:26-30">John 3:26-30</span>). 
        John’s impressive reply was that he must decrease, but Jesus must increase (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:30">John 3:30</span>). 
        Probably to avoid confrontation, Jesus departed Judea to go to Galilee. Samaria provided the most direct route 
        between those two locations, but it was not the only route possible. Devout Jews would take the long way around, 
        going east through Perea. But Jesus had a mission in Samaria.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:5-9">John 4:5-9</span>. 
        How did Jesus use this opportunity to open a dialogue with the woman at the well?</p>

        <p>Jacob’s well was located right next to Shechem, while Sychar, where the woman was from, was about a mile away (1.5 km). 
        Jesus sat by the well while His disciples went into the city to buy food. He had no access to the cooling water of the well. 
        When the woman came to draw water, He asked her for a drink.</p>

        <p>In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3">John 3</span>, it was surprising that Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews 
        and a rabbi, would lower himself to come to Jesus. He came by night to avoid discovery. But, in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4">John 4</span>, 
        the woman hides in broad daylight, perhaps avoiding contact with other women who came either at the beginning or end 
        of the day when it was cooler. After all, why did she go such a long way to fetch water, and in the middle of the day when it was hot? 
        Whatever the reason for her being there, meeting Jesus would change her life.</p>

        <p>What scene unfolds next? A Jewish teacher is compared to a Samaritan woman of poor reputation. What a contrast! 
        And yet, in this exact context, a remarkable encounter unfolds.</p>

        How does Jesus use this encounter to start witnessing to this woman?</p>

        <p>“The hatred between Jews and Samaritans prevented the woman from offering a kindness to Jesus; 
        but the Saviour was seeking to find the key to this heart, and with the tact born of divine love, 
        He asked, not offered, a favor. The offer of a kindness might have been rejected; but trust awakens trust.” 
        —Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 184.</p>

        <p>As was the case in His encounter with Nicodemus, Jesus knows what is in the woman’s heart. In response to her 
        surprise that a Jew would ask such a favor of a Samaritan, Jesus goes directly to the point. “ ‘If you knew the 
        gift of God, and who it is who says to you, “Give Me a drink,” you would have asked Him, and He would have given 
        you living water’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:10">John 4:10, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>The woman’s response was like that of Nicodemus, who asked, “ ‘How can these things be?’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:9">John 3:9, NKJV</span>) in the context of a new birth. 
        She asked, “ ‘You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:11">John 4:11, NKJV</span>). In both cases, Jesus was pointing them 
        (one, a prominent Jewish teacher; the other, a Samaritan woman of dubious character) to the transcendent spiritual 
        truths that each one needed to hear and understand. In each case, Jesus was basically telling them both the same 
        thing: they need a conversion experience.</p>

        <p>What is the Old Testament background to Jesus’ statement about living water? 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Jeremiah 2:13">Jer. 2:13</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Zechariah 14:8">Zech. 14:8</span>).</p>

        <p>Water is necessary for life; humans cannot exist without water, and so water can be a powerful and appropriate 
        image of eternal life, as well. Hence, Jesus says, “ ‘Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will 
        never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into 
        everlasting life’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:14">John 4:14, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>In both cases, Jesus was seeking to reach these people with spiritual truths, even though He used illustrations from the natural world to do so.</p>
        
        <p>At first, neither person understood what Jesus meant. How, asked Nicodemus, can a man be born again? That is, how can he return to his mother’s womb? 
        Nicodemus clearly was functioning at a mundane and earthly level, even though Jesus clearly was pointing him toward spiritual truth. This woman, too, 
        took Jesus’ words about the water in a literal sense when Jesus was clearly talking about something spiritual.</p>
        
        <p>The woman’s response to Jesus’ offer of living water was, “ ‘Give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:15">John 4:15, NKJV</span>). She reasoned that the water Jesus offered would obviate trips to the well, 
        thus reducing the risk of facing others. It is striking that the conversation shifted so quickly from Jesus’ asking for a drink to the woman’s asking Him for a drink.</p>

        <p>Abruptly, Jesus changes the topic of discussion, telling the woman to go call her husband and come back. Why the sudden shift in topic? 
        The woman’s actions bespoke avoidance. Jesus could read her heart. She must face her situation to find healing. “Before this soul could receive 
        the gift He longed to bestow, she must be brought to recognize her sin and her Saviour.” —Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 187.</p>

        What did Jesus do to show this woman that He knew her deepest secrets, and how did she respond?</p>

        <p>The light was too blinding to look at directly. While recognizing Jesus as a prophet, the woman practices avoidance again. 
        She asks Jesus a question of religious controversy between Jews and Samaritans—the proper place to worship.</p>

        <p>In response, Jesus pointed out that the Samaritans did not know what they worshiped. Their worship was a synthesis of 
        Judaism and paganism. The Jews worshiped the God who reveals Himself—another important admission for a Samaritan.</p>

        <p>Worship of the true God is not tied to a place. The discussion, therefore, about a place of worship was irrelevant to the 
        conversation. For God is spirit, and those who worship Him must do so in spirit and in truth. The woman accepted the plain 
        truth conveyed by Jesus and was ready for more.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:25-26">John 4:25, 26</span>. 
        How did Jesus reveal His identity to her?</p>

        <p>In all four Gospels, this is the only passage before His trial in which Jesus plainly stated to someone that He was the Messiah. 
        And He did it not to some large crowd or important personage but to an unnamed Samaritan woman, alone, at Jacob’s well. 
        He is interested in any lonely soul who feels separated.</p>

        <p>And so to this woman, who not only was from a foreign culture but also was not of the highest moral character, Jesus openly 
        reveals who He is. And, having revealed to her His knowledge of her darkest secrets, He also gave this woman a great reason 
        to believe in Him, as well.</p>

        What surprising action did the woman take?</p>

        <p>Jesus’ discussion with the woman was interrupted by the arrival of the disciples. Though surprised 
        that He was speaking with a woman, they did not question Him. Instead, they urged Him to eat.</p>

        <p>The woman, meanwhile, left her water pot and rushed into the city to share with others what she had 
        just experienced with Jesus.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:30-42">John 4:30-42</span>. 
        What happened following this encounter, and what does it teach about how the gospel can be spread?</p>

        <p>It seems strange that Jesus’ narrative about a harvest would interrupt the story of the conversion 
        of many in the city. But John wants us to see how Jesus understood what was happening. Sharing the plan 
        of salvation with a Samaritan woman was far more important to Him than eating. To lead souls to salvation 
        was His purpose, and He used this occasion to teach His disciples the urgency of sharing the gospel with 
        all people, even with those not like them.</p>

        <p>There are many high points in the Gospel of John. Surely <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:39-42">John 4:39-42</span> 
        is among them. Many of the Samaritans believed because of the woman's testimony: “He told me all that 
        I ever did” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:39">John 4:39, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>The Samaritans asked Jesus to stay with them. The result was that many more believed because of the 
        Word of Jesus. “Then they said to the woman, ‘Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we 
        ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world’ 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:42">John 4:42, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>What should this story tell us about how powerful the witness of even one person can be? How powerful 
        a witness are you to what Jesus has done in your life?</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> Ellen G. White, “At Jacob’s Well,” pp. 183-195, in <em>The Desire of Ages</em>.</p>

        <p>“As soon as she had found the Saviour the Samaritan woman brought others to Him. She proved herself a more 
        effective missionary than His own disciples. The disciples saw nothing in Samaria to indicate that it was an 
        encouraging field. Their thoughts were fixed upon a great work to be done in the future. They did not see that 
        right around them was a harvest to be gathered. But through the woman whom they despised, a whole cityful were 
        brought to hear the Saviour. She carried the light at once to her countrymen.</p>

        <p>“This woman represents the working of a practical faith in Christ. Every true disciple is born into the kingdom 
        of God as a missionary. He who drinks of the living water becomes a fountain of life. The receiver becomes a giver. 
        The grace of Christ in the soul is like a spring in the desert, welling up to refresh all, and making those who are 
        ready to perish eager to drink of the water of life.”—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 195.</p>

            <li>In class, go over your answers to Sunday’s final question. Be brutally honest about it. 
            What are the taboos and prejudices found in your culture that could indeed hamper your own witness to others?</li>

            <li>Why do you think Jesus got such a warm reception among the Samaritans in contrast to the reception among His own people?</li>

            <li>Put yourself in the place of that Samaritan woman. A total stranger comes and lets her know that He is 
            aware of her deepest secrets. How could anyone, much less a stranger, have known these things? No wonder she 
            was impressed by Jesus. What should this story tell us about how the Lord knows everything about us, even the 
            deepest, darkest secrets that we would not want anyone to know? And yet, what does the way He treated her 
            say to us about how He wants to deal with us, even when He knows our secrets? What comfort can we draw from this truth?</li>

            <li>What themes in the Gospel of John that we have studied thus far are found in Jesus’ ministry to the 
            Samaritan woman at the well?</li>

    <h3>By Andrew McChesney</h3>
        <p>For most of his life, Rob Schetky, a retired U.S. Navy officer, had struggled with the Bible and its meaning.</p>

        <p>Once an agnostic, Rob was seeking God’s will, but the Sabbath posed a problem. He fumed when people skipped church 
        and engaged in everyday activities on Sunday. He asked, “Why are you playing golf on Sunday?” But inside he wondered, 
        Where in the Bible did God change the Sabbath?</p>

        <p>Rob stopped going to church. He was looking for a new church in Fairbanks, in the U.S. state of Alaska, when an unsolicited 
        book arrived in his post office mailbox. “That’s an interesting name,” he thought, examining the book. “I wonder what 
        The Great Controversy is.”</p>

        <p>Leaving the post office, he passed a stack of Great Controversy books that other people had discarded on a counter. 
        It had been a mass mailing.</p>

        <p>At home, Rob became engrossed in the book. He grew excited as he read how humans, not God, had changed the Sabbath day 
        of worship. Wow! he thought. Someone is telling the history of the church in a very logical way.</p>

        <p>Contacting a friend, he said, “I’ve found a great history of Christianity. It’s called The Great Controversy.” Later, 
        the friend called back. “You’ve got to get away,” he said. “That’s the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They’re a cult!”</p>

        <p>Rob was surprised. He hadn’t noticed the name of the book’s author, Ellen White, and didn’t know that she had cofounded 
        the Adventist Church. “No, they are not a cult,” he said. “They just believe in the Word of God.”</p>

        <p>After the conversation, Rob wondered if Adventists worshiped in Fairbanks. Looking online, he found a church located 
        only a 10-minute drive away. On Sabbath, he grabbed his Bible and The Great Controversy and went to church. He had been 
        reading the book for less than a month.</p>

        <p>The first person to greet him at church was a Sabbath School teacher, Helen. She expressed surprise when she learned that 
        he had come because of The Great Controversy. “You just destroyed my complaints,” she said.</p>

        <p>She had been worried that the small size of the book’s text made it impossible to read. Yet Rob had already read three-fourths 
        of the book—and he had come to church to learn more.</p>

        <p>Today, seven years later, Rob is 70 and a church deacon. He still reads the Bible and the writings of Ellen White daily. 
        “When I found the Seventh-day Adventist Church, I found a home, and I found truth,” he said.</p>

        <p>Jesus doesn’t merely say astonishing things about Himself or about who He is or about who sent Him or about where He came from. 
        He also showed who He is by the miracles and signs that He performed. As some openly testify of Jesus: 
        “ ‘When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this Man has done?’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 7:31">John 7:31, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>He backed up His words with actions that proved the truth of His words.</p>

        <p>But as the drama continues, a division begins among the people. The healing of the man by the pool of Bethesda 
        attracts the ire of some leaders. The discussion in Capernaum following the feeding of the 5,000 results in the rejection 
        of Jesus by the multitudes. The resurrection of Lazarus creates faith in some but triggers in others a hostility 
        that will lead to the trial and execution of Jesus.</p>

        <p>This week’s lesson looks at some of those who witnessed and testified about Jesus. In each of these incidents, 
        some aspects of who Jesus really is are revealed, and together they create a deeper vision of Jesus, the Messiah.</p>

    title: "Humility of Soul: John the Baptist Testifies Again",
    lesson: "6",
    text: `
        <p>Lesson 2 described how the witness of John the Baptist brought the first disciples—Andrew and John, 
        Peter, Philip, and Nathanael—to Jesus. One would expect that the Baptist, having given his witness, 
        would move off the scene. But he reappears several times in the Gospel of John.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:25-36">John 3:25–36</span>. 
        How does John the Baptist compare himself to Jesus?</p>

        <p>A dispute arose between John the Baptist’s disciples and an unnamed Jew about purification, likely 
        a question over the efficacy of baptism (compare with <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 1:4-5">Mark 1:4, 5</span>). 
        Interestingly, when his disciples come to John, no doubt to resolve the question, they bring up Jesus, 
        saying, “ ‘He is baptizing, and all are going to him’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:26">John 3:26, ESV</span>). 
        It is not hard to read between the lines: they are jealous of Jesus—jealous for their master and jealous 
        for themselves, as well.</p>

        <p>It would be all too easy for John to indulge in the jealousy, but he does not because he knows what 
        his mission is. Instead, he reminds his disciples that he never claimed to be the Christ. On the contrary: 
        he came to point toward Him, to prepare the way for Him, to be a witness about Him 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:6-8">John 1:6–8</span>).</p>

        <p>Using the illustration of a wedding, he calls himself the friend of the bridegroom, with Jesus as 
        the bridegroom. The bride would be the people of God (compare with <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Hosea 2:16-23">Hos. 2:16–23</span> 
        and <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Isaiah 62:1-5">Isa. 62:1–5</span>). Then, in words that show John’s true greatness, 
        he says, “He must increase, but I must decrease” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:30">John 3:30</span>).</p>

        <p><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:31-36">John 3:31–36</span> continues the comparison between Jesus and John, 
        showing the superiority of the Messiah over His forerunner. With John’s testimony pointing toward Jesus, 
        the idea of witness is again emphasized. Those who receive that testimony and believe in Jesus have 
        eternal life. Those who do not receive Him remain under the wrath of God. That’s what the text says. 
        God loves the world and sent His Son to redeem the world (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:16-17">John 3:16, 17</span>). 
        But those who refuse the gift offered them will have to pay the penalty for their own sins—eternal death.</p>

        <p><em>How can we learn the lesson of humility before both God and humanity? What can we learn from 
        the example of John here about humility of the soul?</em></p>

    text: `
        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:32-36">John 1:32–36</span>. 
        What does John the Baptist say here about Jesus that the people were not expecting about the long-awaited Messiah?</p>

        <p>The Jews looked for a Messiah to come who would deliver them from the rule of Rome. Long under oppression, 
        the Jews believed that the Messiah would not only overthrow Rome but would establish them as a great and powerful nation. 
        John’s words, however, calling Jesus “the Lamb of God,” although directly pointing to His atoning sacrifice, 
        were probably misunderstood by the majority of people. They might have not known what he was talking about at all.</p>

        <p>Thus, John with his Gospel wanted to change their understanding of the Messiah so that they could recognize in Jesus 
        the fulfillment of the prophecies regarding the coming King and what He would do. He was not coming as a political 
        and military leader but to offer Himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. That was His purpose. Only after 
        that, when all is finished, will the final kingdom come (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Daniel 7:18">Dan. 7:18</span>).</p>

        <p>“When at the baptism of Jesus, John pointed to Him as the Lamb of God, a new light was shed upon the Messiah’s work. 
        The prophet’s mind was directed to the words of Isaiah, ‘He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter.’ 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Isaiah 53:7">Isa. 53:7</span>.”—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 136.</p>

        <p>In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:31">John 1:31</span>, John says “ ‘I did not know Him’ ” (NKJV). 
        So, how then did John come to know Jesus as the Messiah? The answer is that the Lord who sent John had previously said to him, 
        “ ‘ “Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.” And I have 
        seen and testified that this is the Son of God’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:33-34">John 1:33, 34, NKJV</span>). In other words, God revealed to John that 
        Jesus was the Messiah.</p>

        <p>“Christ [is] the power of God and the wisdom of God” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 1:24">1 Cor. 1:24, NKJV</span>). 
        Knowledge that Jesus is the Christ comes from God Himself through the convicting power of His Spirit. This theme appears 
        frequently in John. Salvation does not come from worldly philosophy, science, or higher learning. It comes only from God 
        to a heart surrendered in faith and obedience to Jesus.</p>

        <p><em>How would we know the truth about Jesus as our atoning sacrifice unless it were revealed to us? 
        Why, then, is knowing the Bible and what it teaches about Jesus so crucial?</em></p>

        <p><strong>Lesson 2</strong> described the feeding of the 5,000 in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6">John 6</span> 
        but did not cover the final section of that story, which is studied here.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:51-71">John 6:51–71</span>. What did Jesus say that people 
        had trouble accepting?</p>

        <p>Having just been fed, miraculously, by Jesus, the people were ready to crown Him king 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:1-15">John 6:1–15</span>). But in talking with them later at the Capernaum synagogue, 
        He explains the spiritual meaning of the miracle, saying, “I am the bread of life” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>). 
        He expounds in more detail that this bread is His flesh, which He gives for the life of the world 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:51">John 6:51</span>).</p>

        <p>This saying opened the eyes of the multitude to the fact that Jesus would not be their earthly king. 
        He did not fit the mold produced by earthly thinking. They refused conversion, which would transform the 
        way they thought so that they could recognize and accept Jesus as the Messiah. Many of His disciples left 
        Him at this point (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:66">John 6:66</span>).</p>

        <p>From a human sense, this must have been hard for Jesus. The approbation of the crowd is pleasing. 
        Who doesn’t want to be liked? But seeing many people draw back and question one’s principles is naturally 
        discouraging, as well. Seeing the multitude depart, Jesus asks His inner circle, the Twelve, if they want 
        to leave, too.</p>

        <p>This is when Peter makes his amazing confession, another witness as to both what Jesus has and who He is. 
        “ ‘You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy 
        One of God’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:68-69">John 6:68, 69, ESV</span>).</p>

        <p>The disciples had been with Jesus for a couple of years, traveling with Him, seeing His miracles, hearing 
        His sermons. They knew from experience that there was no one comparable to Him. The conviction settled upon 
        them that, however unusual some situations might be, this man was the Messiah—regardless of how much they 
        still didn't understand about His purpose for coming. Only after His death and resurrection did they start 
        to understand why Jesus came.</p>

        <p><em>What can we learn from this story about the fact that the majority is usually wrong? Why must we remember this, 
        especially with the aspects of our faith that are unpopular with the ­majority—even the majority of Christians?</em></p>

        <p>The Gospel of John begins by talking about the Word (logos) as being with God; that is, being with God the Father 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>). When the Word became flesh, the Spirit testified 
        about Jesus by resting on Him at His baptism (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:32-34">John 1:32–34</span>). 
        But the Father also testifies about Jesus during His earthly ministry.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:36-38">John 5:36–38</span>. What does Jesus say here about the Father?</p>

        <p>Jesus links the Father to the works and miracles that He had performed. He is very clear that the Father had sent Him 
        and also had testified about Him.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 1:11">Mark 1:11</span>, and <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 3:22">Luke 3:22</span> 
        (see also <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="2 Peter 1:17-18">2 Pet. 1:17, 18</span>). What does the Father say about Jesus?</p>

        <p>At the baptism of Jesus, the Father and the Spirit joined the Son in marking this important occasion: the commencement 
        of Jesus’ ministry. The Father states that Jesus is His beloved Son in whom He is well pleased. But, at a crucial time in 
        Christ’s ministry, the Father speaks yet again, this time as recorded in the Gospel of John.</p>

        <p>Things were reaching a climax in the final days of that ministry. The religious leaders, unable to stop Him 
        (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:19">John 12:19</span>), wanted Him dead, now more than ever. The crowds 
        were exuberant over Him, especially as more and more people, hearing the testimony of those who saw Him raise Lazarus 
        from the dead (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:17-18">John 12:17, 18</span>), were starting to follow Jesus. 
        Even Greeks, there for the festival, wanted to see Jesus.</p>

        <p>At this point, in response to Jesus’ words in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:28">John 12:28</span>, 
        “ ‘Father, glorify Your name’ ” (NKJV), the Father again speaks from heaven, “ ‘I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:28">John 12:28, ESV</span>).</p>

        <p>As we have already seen, Jesus’ hour of glory is the cross. Thus, the Father’s testimony about Jesus points to the great 
        sacrifice of the Lamb of God for the sins of the world. It is the culmination of His earthly ministry. His death in our 
        behalf paid the full penalty for all our sins, and in Him, by faith, we never have to face that penalty ourselves.</p>

        <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> “On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out,

        <p>John recorded, numerous times, Jesus making bold statements about Himself, about who He was and what He came to do.</p>

        <p>The lines quoted above from <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 7:37-38">John 7:37, 38</span> are another example of

        <p>Some said He was the Prophet like Moses predicted long ago (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deut. 18:15-19">Deut. 18:15–19</span>). 
        Others thought Jesus was the Christ. But this brought the argument that the Messiah would not come from Galilee, that He had to be of the 
        Davidic line, and that He had to be born in Bethlehem—all of which were true about Jesus (compare with <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 1-2">Matthew 1–2</span>), 
        though many did not seem to know this!</p>

        <p>Even the arresting officers were stymied by Him and the eloquence of His words. The Pharisees responded to the officers with another question. 
        “ ‘Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in Him?’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 7:48">John 7:48, NKJV</span>). 
        This question from the Pharisees gave John the opportunity again to bring in Nicodemus, who, after having had his meeting with Jesus, 
        was seeking to protect Jesus from their machinations. “ ‘Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 7:51">John 7:51, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>Did Nicodemus ever accept Jesus as the Messiah? Though this scene does not prove that he had, between this act and what he did 
        after Jesus died (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:39-40">John 19:39, 40</span>), the Bible gives us solid evidence that 
        Nicodemus did in fact come to believe in Him.</p>

        <p>And so, the answer to their question was, yes, in fact, one of the Pharisees did believe in Him, after all.</p>

        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Read <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 7:49">John 7:49</span>. What were the leaders saying 
        that showed their disdain for the masses who followed after Jesus? What lesson might be here for us?</p>

        in <em>The Desire of Ages</em>.</p>

        <p>“ ‘To whom shall we go?’ The teachers of Israel were slaves to formalism. The Pharisees and Sadducees were in constant 
        contention. To leave Jesus was to fall among sticklers for rites and ceremonies, and ambitious men who sought their own glory. 
        The disciples had found more peace and joy since they had accepted Christ than in all their previous lives. How could they go back 
        to those who had scorned and persecuted the Friend of sinners? They had long been looking for the Messiah; now He had come, and they 
        could not turn from His presence to those who were hunting His life, and had persecuted them for becoming His followers.</p>

        <p>“ ‘To whom shall we go?’ Not from the teaching of Christ, His lessons of love and mercy, to the darkness of unbelief, the 
        wickedness of the world. While the Saviour was forsaken by many who had witnessed His wonderful works, Peter expressed the faith of 
        the disciples,—‘Thou art that Christ.’ The very thought of losing this anchor of their souls filled them with fear and pain. 
        To be destitute of a Saviour was to be adrift on a dark and stormy sea.”—Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 393.</p>

        <p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>In class, talk about the difficult question of why some people, when given evidence for Jesus as the Messiah and 
            for the truth of Christianity, gladly accept it, and why others, when given that same evidence, reject it?</li>

            <li>What more important truth could there be than that Jesus Christ died for our sins? Yet, how did we ever come to know 
            this crucial truth? By science, natural law, natural theology, logic, and reason? While these things could, in fact, lead us 
            to believe in a Creator God, a First Cause, an Unmoved Mover, or something else, none of these disciplines, either alone or even 
            together, could teach us the most important truth that we need to know: Christ died for our sins. What should this fact—that all 
            these disciplines, even in principle, could not lead us to the one thing that we really need to know—teach us about how crucial it 
            is to make the Bible our final and ultimate authority on matters of faith?</li>

            <li>Why is it so important for someone’s own faith to recount the things God has done in his or her life?</li>

        <p>For four years, Donaldo Velasquez visited a Colombian prison every Friday to preach about Jesus. 
        But one Friday, he couldn’t go. He worked as a carpenter, and a client urgently needed his help. 
        Moreover, Donaldo needed the money.</p>

        <p>Only four Seventh-day Adventists—Donaldo, two other church members, and their pastor—had permission 
        to visit the prison in Acacias, and Donaldo called them for help. “No, I’m too busy,” Ranses said. 
        Pedro also said he couldn’t go. The pastor apologized, saying he was out of town.</p>

        <p>Donaldo wept and prayed. When his wife, Jesusita, asked what was wrong, he explained that he didn’t 
        want to skip the meeting with the inmates but he needed to work. “Go, do your job,” Jesusita said. 
        “God will provide.”</p>

        <p>The next time Donaldo visited the prison, 38 inmates came to hear him preach. He was accompanied 
        by another church member, Pedro.</p>

        <p>“Where is the man who came last time?” an inmate asked.</p>

        <p>“We didn’t send anyone,” Donaldo replied.</p>

        <p>“Yes, you did,” said another inmate. “A man preached to us.”</p>

        <p>“No, we didn’t send anyone,” Donaldo said, and he suggested that perhaps the preacher had belonged 
        to another denomination.</p>

        <p>“No, no,” the inmates said. “We know everyone who has permission to visit. This man has never visited 
        before, and he wasn’t from another church.”</p>

        <p>Donaldo asked about the man’s sermon, hoping for a clue to his identity. The inmates said he had spoken 
        about the seventh-day Sabbath.</p>

        <p>Amazed, Donaldo asked, “What did he look like?”</p>

        <p>The inmates described him as a tall, well-dressed man wearing a white shirt. They said he knew the Bible 
        so well that he probably was a teacher.</p>

        <p>Pedro touched Donaldo’s arm. “An angel must have come and preached to them,” he said. “That’s the only 
        explanation.”</p>

        <p>Donaldo, however, wasn’t convinced. He went to the prison guard who registered visitors. The guard, a 
        friend of Donaldo’s, looked through the computer log and shook his head. “No one came that day,” he said.</p>

        <p>Astonished, Donaldo exclaimed, “Now I have no doubt that the angel of the Lord came to teach the Bible 
        in my place!”</p>

        <p>Returning to the inmates, he informed them that they must have seen an angel.</p>

        <p>Six years have passed, and nearly all 38 inmates have given their hearts to Jesus in baptism. Donaldo said 
        he won’t ever forget that day.</p>

        <p>“Even though it is an incredible story, I believe God sent His heavenly messenger,” he said.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:56">John 8:56</span>. 
        Jesus was not shy in declaring who He was, nor in calling on witnesses to testify to who He was, 
        even witnesses who were long gone, including Abraham. “‘Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, 
        and he saw it and was glad’” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:56">John 8:56, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why was Abraham’s witness so important that it was included in John’s gospel? 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 18:16-18">Genesis 18:16–18</span>,

        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 3:25">Acts 3:25</span>.)</p>

        <p>“Through type and promise God ‘preached before the gospel unto Abraham.’ <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Galatians 3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>. 
        And the patriarch’s faith was fixed upon the Redeemer to come. Said Christ to the Jews, 
        ‘Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see My day; and he saw it, and was glad.’ 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:56">John 8:56</span>, R.V., margin. The ram offered in place of Isaac represented the Son of God, 
        who was to be sacrificed in our stead. When man was doomed to death by transgression of the law of God, 
        the Father, looking upon His Son, said to the sinner, ‘Live: I have found a ransom.’”—Ellen G. White, 
        <em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, p. 154.</p>

        <p>Abraham was the father of the Jewish nation. He received the promise that, through him, all nations would be blessed. 
        This blessing came through the Messiah, born through his lineage.</p>

        <p>Abraham was also the father of those who respond to God in faith 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Hebrews 11:8,17-19">Heb. 11:8, 17–19</span>). 
        His willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 22">Genesis 22</span>), 
        the son of promise, was not only an evidence of faith but a window into the plan of salvation.</p>

        <p>When Jesus said, “‘Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day’” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:56">John 8:56, NKJV</span>), the leaders responded, 
        “‘You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?’” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:57">John 8:57, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>Jesus’ answer was astounding. “‘Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM’” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:58">John 8:58, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>Jesus uses language reminiscent of what God said to Moses at the burning bush. 
        This was a claim to be God, the self-existent One. No question, the leaders understood 
        the implication of what He said because they then “took up stones to throw at Him” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:59">John 8:59, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 4:1-5">Romans 4:1–5</span>. 
        How does Paul use this story of Abraham to reveal the great truth of salvation by faith alone, 
        without the deeds of the law? How do these verses help us understand the idea of Abraham as 
        the father of those who live by faith?</p>

    title: "The Witness of Mary",
    lesson: "7",
    text: `
        <p>Six days before Passover, Jesus came to visit Mary, Martha, and their brother Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised to life. 
        Simon, who had been healed of leprosy, hosted a feast in appreciation for what Jesus had done for him. Martha was 
        serving, and Lazarus was sitting at the table with the guests 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:1-8">John 12:1–8</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>What was the significance of Mary’s actions here? How was this a witness to who Jesus really was? 
        (See <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:1-3">John 12:1–3</span>.)</strong></p>

        <p>The perfume was very expensive, worth about a year’s wages for the common laborer. Mary probably brought this gift 
        as an expression of gratitude to the Savior for the forgiveness of her sins and for the resurrection of her brother. 
        She intended it to be used someday for the burial of Jesus. But then she heard that He would soon be anointed King. 
        In that case, she would be the first to bring Him honor.</p>

        <p>Mary probably did not intend for her gesture to be noticed, but John notes, “The house was filled with the fragrance 
        of the perfume” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:3">John 12:3, ESV</span>). Judas responded with a quick 
        rebuke, stating that the perfume should have been sold and the proceeds given to the poor. Jesus immediately put 
        Mary at ease by stating, “ ‘Let her alone; . . . The poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:7-8">John 12:7, 8, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>A recurring theme runs through the Gospel. Jesus knows what is in people 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 2:24-25">John 2:24, 25</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:70-71">John 6:70, 71</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:11">John 13:11</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 16:19">John 16:19</span>). In this instance at Simon’s feast, Jesus knows what 
        is in Judas. John is careful to point out who Judas is—a self-serving thief 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:6">John 12:6</span>).</p>

        <p>“The fragrant gift which Mary had thought to lavish upon the dead body of the Saviour she poured upon His living 
        form. At the burial its sweetness could only have pervaded the tomb; now it gladdened His heart with the assurance 
        of her faith and love. . . . And as He went down into the darkness of His great trial, He carried with Him the memory 
        of that deed, an earnest of the love that would be His from His redeemed ones forever.” —Ellen G. White, 
        <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 560.</p>

        <p>Jesus knew what was in the heart of Mary and the heart of Judas. He knows what’s in your heart, as well. 
        What should this truth tell us about the need of Christ as our righteousness, transforming us and covering us, as well?</p>

        <p>Time and again, John records the attempts of the religious leaders to seize Jesus, to bring Him to trial, 
        and to sentence Him to death. A theme in John’s Gospel, stated often by Jesus, is that His time or hour had 
        not yet come, by which He meant the time for His crucifixion (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 2:4">John 2:4</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 7:6">John 7:6</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 7:8">8</span>,

        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:1">John 13:1</span>; <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 17:1">John 17:1</span>).</p>

        <p>Now the hour had come. Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, brought before Annas, then Caiaphas 
        the high priest, then twice before Pilate.</p>

        <p>John has called upon many witnesses from every walk of life to testify that Jesus was the Christ. Now John 
        calls upon Pilate, the governor who tried Jesus. This was an important testimony because Pilate was a Roman, 
        a governor, and a judge; most of the other witnesses were Jews and commoners.</p>

        <p>How is Pilate’s verdict connected to the theme of John’s Gospel? 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 18:38">John 18:38</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:4">John 19:4–22</span>.</p>

        <p>Jesus was brought to Pilate early on Friday morning (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 18:28">John 18:28</span>). 
        His plan was to dispatch the prisoner quickly to His fate. But Jesus’ demeanor drew Pilate’s attention. 
        The governor questioned Jesus closely and heard from His lips, “ ‘For this purpose I was born and for this 
        purpose I have come into the world—to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 18:37">John 18:37, ESV</span>).</p>

        <p>Though the governor ultimately condemned Jesus to death, he nonetheless three times proclaimed Jesus innocent 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 18:38">John 18:38</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:4">John 19:4</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:6">6</span>). And over the cross he wrote the words “ ‘Jesus of Nazareth, 
        the King of the Jews’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:19">John 19:19, ESV</span>), completing his 
        witness to who Jesus is. And yet despite his testimony of Christ’s innocence, he nevertheless condemned Jesus to death.</p>

        <p>Pilate had the Truth Himself standing before him and yet—allowing the mob to bully him—Pilate sentenced Jesus 
        to death anyway! What a tragic example of not following what your conscience and heart tell you is correct!</p>

        <p><em>What can we learn from Pilate’s example about the dangers of allowing popular sentiment, even pressure, 
        to keep us from doing what we believe is right?</em></p>

        What can we learn from the story of Thomas about faith and doubt? What major mistake did Thomas make?</p>

        <p>Christ appeared to the disciples after His resurrection, when they were shut up together in a room because of fear. 
        Thomas was not with them. Later, he heard the reports of the Resurrection from the other disciples, but he despaired. 
        It did not fit his picture of the kingdom. And, too, he surely must have wondered why Jesus would have revealed Himself 
        to the others when he himself was not there.</p>

        <p>Thomas said, “ ‘Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, 
        and put my hand into His side, I will not believe’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:25">John 20:25, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>Thomas was dictating the conditions of his faith. This approach to faith in Jesus has appeared again and again in John. 
        Nicodemus answered Jesus with, “ ‘How can a man be born when he is old?’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:4">John 3:4, NKJV</span>). 
        The woman at the well asked, “ ‘Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:11">John 4:11, NRSV</span>). The crowd who had been fed with the loaves and fishes asked, 
        “ ‘What sign are you going to give us?’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:30">John 6:30, NRSV</span>). </p>

        <p>It is this “see and then believe” perspective that the Gospel of John counters. When Jesus met Thomas after the Resurrection, 
        He invited him to come, see, and touch His risen body. But then He says, “ ‘Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:29">John 20:29, ESV</span>).</p>

        <p>“God never asks us to believe, without giving sufficient evidence upon which to base our faith. His existence, His character, 
        the truthfulness of His word, are all established by testimony that appeals to our reason; and this testimony is abundant. 
        Yet God has never removed the possibility of doubt. Our faith must rest upon evidence, not demonstration.” 
        —Ellen G. White, <em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 105.</p>

        <p>Through the Word of God, through the Creation, and through personal experience, we have been given an incredible amount 
        of evidence for our faith in Jesus.</p>

        <p>Again and again, as John presents witnesses to Jesus, his point is to bring us to a sweeping conclusion: 
        “And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book; but 
        these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have 
        life in His name” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:30-31">John 20:30, 31, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>Imagine having been there, in person, in the flesh, and having seen Jesus do many of these miracles. 
        We’d certainly believe, wouldn’t we? We’d like to think so; but, in some ways, we have even more reasons 
        to believe in Jesus than did those who actually saw the miracles.</p>

        <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

        <p>What are some of the things that we have today that those living at the time of Jesus didn’t have that 
        should help us believe? (See, for example, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 24:14">Matthew 24:14</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 24:6-8">Matthew 24:6–8</span>.)</p>

        <p>And that’s because we have not only the powerful accounts in John’s Gospel, but also the great advantage 
        of seeing so much of what Jesus and other Bible writers predicted would come true, such as the destruction of 
        the temple (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>), the spread of the gospel 
        around the world (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 24:14">Matthew 24:14</span>), the great falling 
        away (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="2 Thess 2:3">2 Thess. 2:3</span>), and the world continuing to 
        be a fallen and evil place (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 24:6-8">Matthew 24:6–8</span>). All during 
        the life and ministry of Jesus, His following remained a small and harassed group of men and women who, by all 
        human standards, should have vanished from history a long time ago. How could they have known, as we do, that 
        all these things would come to pass? And they have. In fact, our own faith itself exists as a fulfillment of 
        Jesus’ own prophecy that the gospel would go to all the world.</p>

        <p>And, today, about two thousand years later, as followers of Jesus, we also have the privilege of bearing 
        witness to Jesus and to what He has done for us. It is not by the reasoning of Nathanael, Nicodemus, the woman 
        of Samaria, or the teachings of the Pharisees that we can know Jesus as the Messiah for ourselves. It is by 
        the reading of the Scriptures under the convicting power of the Holy Spirit that we accept Jesus as the Savior 
        of the world.</p>

        <p>And then, each one of us, in our way, and out of our own relationship with God, can have a story to tell. 
        Our story may not be as dramatic as seeing the dead raised or someone blind from birth healed, but that doesn’t 
        matter. What matters is that we know Jesus for ourselves, and in our own way bear witness to Him, as did those 
        in John’s Gospel.</p>

        <p>Thomas “cast himself at the feet of Jesus crying, ‘My Lord and my God.’ ”</p>

        <p>“Jesus accepted his acknowledgment, but gently reproved his unbelief: ‘Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed: 
        blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.’ The faith of Thomas would have been more pleasing to Christ if he 
        had been willing to believe upon the testimony of his brethren. Should the world now follow the example of Thomas, no one would 
        believe unto salvation; for all who receive Christ must do so through the testimony of others.</p>

        <p>“Many who are given to doubt excuse themselves by saying that if they had the evidence which Thomas had from his companions, 
        they would believe. They do not realize that they have not only that evidence, but much more. Many who, like Thomas, wait for 
        all cause of doubt to be removed, will never realize their desire. They gradually become confirmed in unbelief. Those who 
        educate themselves to look on the dark side, and murmur and complain, know not what they do. They are sowing the seeds of doubt, 
        and they will have a harvest of doubt to reap. At a time when faith and confidence are most essential, many will thus find 
        themselves powerless to hope and believe.” —Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 807, 808.</p>

            <li>Pilate asked a very philosophical question: “What is truth?” Give your answer to that question in light of all we have studied in John.</li>
            <li>Look at the prophecies of Daniel 2 and 7. Though those in the time of Jesus had these two chapters, what great advantage do we 
            have today that they didn’t have back then, in terms of seeing those prophecies fulfilled and thus having even more reasons to believe?</li>

        <p>Jacob Pierce’s whole family loved trading pins, and they fanned out to find new pins at the International Pathfinder Camporee in the United States.</p>

        <p>Then Mother saw a man with an Alaska pin. Knowing that Jacob loved Alaskan nature, she tried to convince the man to make a trade.</p>

        <p>“I can’t trade,” he said. “It is a one-of-a-kind pin for pastors in Alaska.”</p>

        <p>Mother’s interest only grew. “What do you do up in Alaska?” she asked.</p>

        <p>The man introduced himself as Tobin Dodge, director of Alaska Camps, a mission initiative of the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s Alaska Conference, which sponsors camps for children ages 8 to 17 every summer.</p>

        <p>“Could my son work there?” Mother asked.</p>

        <p>“Yes, we take counselors-in-training at 16 and counselors at 18,” he said.</p>

        <p>Jacob jumped at the idea of spending the summer in Alaska. He joined the camp staff—and went three years in a row.</p>

        <p>The camp experience can be challenging, he said. One year, he enjoyed spending time with an Alaska Native boy at Camp Polaris, located on Lake Aleknagik in southwestern Alaska. They shared an interest in nature and climbed Jackknife Mountain, which looms above the camp. But the boy refused to behave. He also used vulgar language and seemed more interested in promoting superstitions than hearing Bible truth. He blamed a rainy day on a boy who had killed a spider, saying, “If you kill a spider, it rains.”</p>

        <p>Jacob grew frustrated. But at the end of camp, the boy gave Jacob a hug and walked over to his father. As he watched the two, Jacob suddenly began to understand the boy’s behavior. The boy was practically raising himself.</p>

        <p>“Most of the kids don’t have any Christian background at all,” Jacob, 20, said in an interview at Camp Polaris. “That’s what makes it really an eye-opener and, to me, an amazing mission field.”</p>

        <p>He said the spiritual battles at Camp Polaris are different from those at other summer camps sponsored by the Alaska Conference because it is comprised almost entirely of Alaska Native children, who often face struggles with trauma, superstition, and substance abuse.</p>

        <p>“But being here is worth it,” he said. “It is a calling that is stronger than any that I have seen. God really needs volunteers here. This is a mission field.”</p>

        <p>Thank you for your 2016 Thirteenth Sabbath Offering that helped repair and expand Camp Polaris so more children could attend. Part of this quarter’s Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will help open a center of influence at the Adventist church in Bethel, Alaska. The Bethel Church sends local children to Camp Polaris every year.</p>

            that the Father has sent Me’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:36">John 5:36</span>, NKJV).
        </blockquote>

        <p>We can see again and again in the book of John all the things that Jesus said and did which revealed that, yes, 
        the Messiah (hammashiach), the Christ, had come to Israel. And He had come, in fact, as one of them, a Jew born in 
        Bethlehem, just as the Scriptures had predicted.</p>

        <p>Yet, as John wrote, “He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:10">John 1:10</span>, NKJV).</p>

        <p>He was in the world, the world was made through Him, and yet the world did not know Him? That’s an amazing statement. 
        And, as we can see in John and in the other Gospels, many people didn’t know Him even though they should have, especially 
        because of all the things that Jesus did and said. And, even more so, because the Old Testament scriptures pointed to Him.</p>

        <p>This week we will look at more ways John revealed Jesus as the Messiah, and also, we will look at why some people still 
        continued to reject Him—despite all the powerful reasons affirming Him as the Christ.</p>

        <p>In addition to the specific miracles that John used to point to Jesus as the Messiah, 
        he also recorded the broader discussion about the signs, works, and wonders that Jesus did.</p>

        <p>The signs and wonders, in and of themselves, were not proof of His Messiahship because many prophets, 
        sometimes false ones, also performed miracles. John did not record the signs because they pointed to a 
        great miracle worker only. The signs that John wrote about had the unique character of pointing to Jesus 
        as the Messiah and to show that He, indeed, came from God the Father Himself.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:17,20,36-38">John 5:17, 20, 36–38</span>. 
        How do these verses describe the relationship between Jesus and God the Father, especially in the context of the signs?</p>

        <p>Jesus used the signs to show His close working relationship with the Father. The two were one. The works showed 
        that “ ‘the Father is in Me, and I in Him’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:38">John 10:38, NKJV</span>; 
        see also <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:10-11">John 14:10, 11</span>).</p>

        <p>The purpose of Jesus’ coming was to do the works of the One who sent Him, in order that these works might be made 
        manifest to the world. That is, He came to do the work that the Father sent Him to do, and the works that He did 
        testified, clearly, that He was from the Father.</p>

        <p>And yet, as we have already seen, even despite the powerful signs and the testimonies from many people, 
        people still chose not to believe.</p>

        <p>The religious leaders asked Jesus, “ ‘How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.’ 
        Jesus answered them, ‘I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father’s name, they bear witness 
        of Me’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:24-25">John 10:24, 25, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>If Jesus had come right out and said He was the Messiah, the religious leaders—looking for anything they could find 
        against Him—would have pounced on Him. Knowing this, Jesus instead pointed to the works He had done. If Jesus had said 
        He was the Christ, they could easily seek to deny that. But how could they deny the signs, the works, and the wonders? 
        These were powerful testimonies to who He was and where He had come from.</p>

        <p><em>How can we protect ourselves from having the kind of hard hearts we see among these religious leaders?

        <p>In addition to the specific signs and testimonies that John used to point to Jesus as the Messiah, 
        John also appealed to the authority of the Old Testament and to its prophecies, which foretold the work of Christ. 
        The Old Testament is central, not just to John’s Gospel but to all the New Testament. Justification for Jesus, 
        for who He was, where He came from, what He did, and what He will do—is based on Scripture, in this case the Old Testament.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:39-40">John 5:39, 40</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:46-47">46, 47</span>. What do they teach us about Jesus’ attitude toward 
        the authority of Scripture?</p>

        <p>All through the Gospels, time and again, Jesus points to the authority of Scripture as a key witness to Him. 
        For instance, Jesus often uses events from the Old Testament to help point to Himself and to what He does. 
        The following is one case, where He takes an event from <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Numbers 21:5-9">Numbers 21:5–9</span>. 
        “ ‘As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:14">John 3:14, NKJV</span>). Here, not only does Jesus refer to the story, 
        but by using it to point to Himself, He basically gives us the authoritative interpretation of what the story meant to convey.</p>

        <p>And not just Jesus, but others, as well, use the Old Testament to point to Jesus. For example, early on in John, 
        we read the words of Philip: “ ‘We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:45">John 1:45, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:18">John 13:18</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 17:12">John 17:12</span>; and <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:24">John 19:24</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:28">28</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 19:36">36</span>. 
        What do they teach about the authority of Scripture as understood by Jesus and John? What should this tell us about the crucial 
        role all Scripture must have for our faith, as well?</p>

        <p>In a discussion with the religious leaders about His identity, Jesus affirmed the authority of Scripture. 
        At first glance, it would seem unnecessary for Him to do that because the religious leaders believed in Scripture. 
        Nevertheless, even with them, Jesus would emphasize the authority of the Scriptures, and He did so in order to show 
        them who He was—no matter how hard their hearts were, and no matter how much they tried to fight conviction.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, John records many direct quotations from and allusions to the Old Testament that point to Jesus 
        as the fulfillment of the Old Testament promise of a Messiah.</p>

        <p><strong>How are the following New Testament and Old Testament passages linked? That is, how does the New Testament 
        use these texts to bear witness to Jesus?</strong></p>

        <p>Not just John, but Peter, Paul, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and all the New Testament writers, under the inspiration 
        of the Holy Spirit, time and again stress how Jesus of Nazareth’s life, death, resurrection, and ascension to the 
        throne of God are all fulfillments of the Old Testament prophecies.</p>

        <p>And although Jesus was continually pointing the disciples to the Scriptures, which foretold His ministry—when did 
        the disciples finally understand that the Scriptures pointed to His death and resurrection? It was only after He died 
        and was resurrected and appeared to them that they, finally, got it. “Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, 
        His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus 
        had said” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 2:22">John 2:22, NKJV</span>; see also

        What an incredible claim to make about Himself!</p>

        <p>Estimates vary, but some scholars argue that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled hundreds of Old Testament prophecies. 
        Whatever the amount, the odds against one man’s fulfilling even a few of them, much less them all, are staggering. 
        Every now and then someone will use an image like this: imagine filling an area the size of Texas with coins two feet 
        high and painting one coin pink and then mixing them all up. Then give a blindfolded person one chance to pick the pink coin. 
        What are the odds that, with one pick, he or she would get the pink one?</p>

        <p>No question—Christ’s birth, life, and death were predicted by the Old Testament, stunning evidence of His identity as the expected Messiah. 
        John points to these Old Testament texts again and again to make that very point about who Jesus was, and also, why we should believe 
        in Him and accept the salvation He offers.</p>

        <p>In our study of John so far, we’ve seen that John shows how Jesus, indeed, is the promised Messiah, 
        the great hope that the Jewish people had been longing for.</p>

        <p>And yet, many of the religious leaders, the spiritual guides of the people, were His biggest enemies instead.</p>

        <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:12-30">John 8:12–30</span>. 
        What is the dynamic here between Jesus and these religious leaders? Which texts best explain why many rejected Him?</p>

        <p>Jesus says that they know neither Him nor the Father (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:19">John 8:19</span>). 
        They should have known both, but these men were self-deceived. They were so caught up in their own traditions and philosophies 
        that even with Jesus right before them, doing all the things that He did and saying the things that He said—all powerful 
        revelations of the Father—they still rejected Him.</p>

        <p>Second, Jesus says to them, “ ‘You are from beneath’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:23">John 8:23</span>, NKJV). 
        In other words, however religious they might be, these were not spiritual, godly men. They had a “form of godliness” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="2 Timothy 3:5">2 Tim. 3:5</span>), but that was all. They had outward piety but inward disbelief.</p>

        <p>This was nothing new: “ ‘Inasmuch as these people draw near with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, but have removed 
        their hearts far from Me, and their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Isaiah 29:13">Isa. 29:13</span>, NKJV). This very concept is echoed by Jesus centuries 
        later, when He said, “ ‘And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Mark 7:7">Mark 7:7</span>, NKJV). Their human teachings, their human commandments, 
        were “of this world” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:23">John 8:23</span>) and, as Jesus then said, 
        “I am not of this world” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:23">John 8:23</span>).</p>

        <p>It was bad enough that these men had been deceiving themselves; the tragedy was made worse because they also led others astray, 
        even though, interestingly enough, John wrote that as a result of the exchange depicted in these verses, 
        “many believed in Him” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:30">John 8:30</span>, NKJV).</p>

        <p>Thus, even despite bad leadership, many Jews were able to get beyond it and see, for themselves, who Jesus was.</p>

        <p><em>What lessons do you draw from Jesus’ exchange with the religious leaders? How can we be “from above” and not “from beneath”—and how can we know the difference?</em></p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> Ellen G. White, <em>“ ‘Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled,’ ”</em> 
        pp. 662–680, in <em>The Desire of Ages</em>.</p>

        <p>“As a golden treasure, truth had been entrusted to the Hebrew people. The Jewish economy, 
        bearing the signature of Heaven, had been instituted by Christ Himself. In types and symbols 
        the great truths of redemption were veiled. Yet when Christ came, the Jews did not recognize 
        Him to whom all these symbols pointed. They had the word of God in their hands; but the traditions 
        which had been handed down from generation to generation, and the human interpretation of the Scriptures, 
        hid from them the truth as it is in Jesus. The spiritual import of the sacred writings was lost. 
        The treasure house of all knowledge was open to them, but they knew it not.</p>

        <p>“God does not conceal His truth from men. By their own course of action they make it obscure 
        to themselves. Christ gave the Jewish people abundant evidence that He was the Messiah; but His 
        teaching called for a decided change in their lives. They saw that if they received Christ, they 
        must give up their cherished maxims and traditions, their selfish, ungodly practices. It required 
        a sacrifice to receive changeless, eternal truth. Therefore they would not admit the most conclusive 
        evidence that God could give to establish faith in Christ. They professed to believe the Old Testament 
        Scriptures, yet they refused to accept the testimony contained therein concerning Christ’s life and character. 
        They were afraid of being convinced lest they should be converted and be compelled to give up their 
        preconceived opinions. The treasure of the gospel, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, was among them, 
        but they rejected the greatest gift that Heaven could bestow.”—Ellen G. White, <em>Christ’s Object Lessons</em>, p. 105.</p>

        <p>Zurab considered himself a Christian, but his relationship with God consisted solely of lighting candles 
        in a cathedral in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. He had a Bible at home, but he only picked it up to dust it.</p>

        <p>Then his conscience began to bother him, and he thought, <em>If I’m a Christian, why don’t I read the Bible?</em> 
        A desire filled him to read the Bible.</p>

        <p>He picked up the Bible and read it from beginning to end. He learned for the first time about the seventh-day Sabbath. 
        Surprised, he looked online for more information. He watched about 100 YouTube sermons and was drawn to a preacher 
        who explained the Bible in a clear manner. The preacher identified himself as a Seventh-day Adventist and said the church 
        was comprised of millions of members who kept the seventh-day Sabbath.</p>

        <p>Zurab had never heard of Adventists, and he recoiled at the idea of becoming one. Many Georgians think Adventists belong 
        to a sect. He searched the internet for another church that worshiped on the seventh day and practiced other biblical truths 
        that he had learned, but to no avail.</p>

        <p>So, on a Sabbath morning, he showed up at an Adventist church in Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi. He stood outside, wanting to go in 
        and not wanting to go in. Then the door swung open, and someone invited him inside.</p>

        <p>Zurab received a warm welcome.</p>

        <p>“Is this your first time in the Adventist Church?” someone asked.</p>

        <p>“Yes, this is my first time,” he said.</p>

        <p>“Great!” someone else said. “Come also to our evangelistic program.”</p>

        <p>It turned out that the church planned to hold evangelistic meetings on that very evening. Zurab attended the worship service 
        in the morning and the evangelistic meeting in the evening. After that, he returned every evening for the next two weeks. 
        Then he was baptized.</p>

        <p>Today, a year later, 36-year-old Zurab has a new relationship with God. He reads the Bible every day and shares it with 
        his wife and two boys, who also go to church with him on Sabbath. Zurab is amazed at how everything came together—his desire 
        to read the Bible, his discovery of the Sabbath and the online preacher, and his arrival at the Adventist church on the same 
        day as its first evangelistic meeting.</p>

        <p>He didn’t go to the church because of a mission outreach initiative. But the church members’ mission spirit made him feel 
        welcome and at home. “Everything came together so well,” he said.</p>

        <p>Part of a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this year went to a health center in Georgia. Please pray for God to draw people 
        to the center, just as He brought Zurab to the church, to learn more about Him.

        <p><strong>Memory Text:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“ ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:6">John 14:6, NKJV</span>).</blockquote>

        <p>In the Gospel of John, when asked who He was, Jesus answered with the term that designates deity. “I AM” 
        was an unmistakable reference to the Lord Himself, who had appeared to Moses in the burning bush. 
        “ ‘I AM WHO I AM,’ ” He said to Moses (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Exod. 3:14">Exod. 3:14</span>). 
        And this same God, the “I AM,” then “became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as 
        of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:14">John 1:14, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>The theme “I AM” threads throughout John. This week’s memory verse reflects that theme: 
        “ ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:6">John 14:6, NKJV</span>). The “I AM” is the Light of the world, 
        the Bread of Life, the Gate or the Door of the sheep, the Good Shepherd, and the True Vine.</p>

        <p>This week continues with the revelation of God as given us in John. We will also more fully explore the flip 
        side of things, in which, despite the powerful evidence for Jesus as the Messiah, some rejected Him. We will study 
        this idea for two reasons: to avoid the same mistake, but also to consider how we might be able to reach out to those 
        in danger of making that mistake, as well.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1">John 1:1</span>. 
        The apostle clearly states that Jesus is God, the divine Son. Consequently, in 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:4">John 1:4</span>—“In Him was life, and the life was the light of men” (NKJV)—the 
        reference to life here has to be divine life, underived eternal self-existence. Because He has life within Himself, 
        He can lay down His life and take it again (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:17">John 10:17</span>). And, because He has life within, He can give 
        life to whom He will (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:21">John 5:21</span>; compare with <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:19">John 14:19</span>).</p>

        <p>This term life (<em>zoē</em>) appears 36 times in the Gospel of John, about 25 percent of the uses in the New Testament. 
        In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:4-5">John 1:4, 5</span>, besides referring to the Source of life on our planet, the word is also linked to salvation. 
        Throughout the rest of John, this idea of life (<em>zoē</em>) is most often expressed as everlasting life, the promise of salvation 
        (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:15">John 3:15</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:16">16</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:36">36</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:14">John 4:14</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 4:36">36</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:27">John 6:27</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:40">40</span>,

        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:68">68</span>; and <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:27">John 10:27</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:28">28</span>). 
        Thus, the One who gave life at Creation is the same One who brings salvation, eternal life, to a lost world.</p>

        <p><strong>Why did Jesus come to this earth?</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:29">John 1:29</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:16">John 3:16</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:40">John 6:40</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:10">John 10:10</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:27">John 12:27</span>.</p>

        <p>“ ‘As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 
        that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:14-15">John 3:14, 15</span>, NKJV).</p>

        <p>Just as the bronze serpent took the place of the Israelites who had been bitten by serpents, so Jesus took our place, 
        we who have been struck down by sin. He took the penalty that was ours so that we might have the life that was His.</p>

        <p>Christ also desires that we have life and have it more abundantly (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:10">John 10:10</span>). 
        Thus, for “as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 
        who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:12-13">John 1:12, 13</span>, NKJV).</p>

        <p>Christ came to reveal the Father to us. For, “no one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, 
        He has declared Him” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>, NKJV). By seeing the character of Jesus, 
        we can see the character of the Father.</p>

        <p><em>What can we learn from the life of Jesus about the character of the Father? Why is this revelation such good news?</em></p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:61-68">John 6:61–68</span>. 
        When Jesus asked the disciples if they would leave Him, what was the meaning of Peter’s answer?</p>

        <p>Peter’s words about “eternal life” tap into a theme that runs throughout the Gospel of John. 
        A concentration of phraseology about eternal life appears in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6">John 6</span>, 
        in the context of the feeding of the 5,000 (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:27">John 6:27</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:40">40</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:47">47</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:54">54</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:68">68</span>). 
        Jesus says that He is the Bread of Life (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>), 
        meaning that His life, His death, and His resurrection are the source of eternal salvation.</p>

        <p>The phrase everlasting life or its equivalent occurs at least 17 times in the Gospel of John. 
        This term does not refer to a spirit existence, or to becoming part of an eternal being, or to some other 
        ethereal concept. Rather, it refers to that life-giving power that brings salvation and meaning to our existence 
        now and to life without end when our Lord returns. Just as Jesus became flesh, so the resurrection that Jesus 
        talks about takes place in time and space and in a physical body. It is a resurrection from the dead, a renewal 
        of the life that we once had in Eden.</p>

        <p><strong>How do we receive eternal life?</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:15">John 3:15</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:16">16</span>; <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:24">John 5:24</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:40">John 6:40</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:47">47</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:31">John 8:31</span>; <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 12:46">John 12:46</span>; 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:31">John 20:31</span>.</p>

        <p>By faith alone we believe that Jesus Christ came to live and to die on our behalf. This faith comes to us as a gift, 
        but we must consciously choose to surrender ourselves to Jesus, to repent, and to claim His blood for the forgiveness 
        and cleansing of sin.</p>

        <p>When Jesus asked Peter if he, too, was going to leave, Peter’s answer, “ ‘Lord, to whom shall we go? 
        You have the words of eternal life’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:68">John 6:68, NKJV</span>), 
        encapsulates the essence of salvation and how we attain it. It doesn’t come from philosophy, history, or science—all 
        human disciplines. It comes from Jesus, who—possessing in Himself eternal life—offers it freely to all who, 
        responding to the Holy Spirit, will accept it.</p>

        <p><em>How does the promise of having eternal life impact how we view our temporal life here? How should it impact how we view it?</em></p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:12-13">John 1:12, 13</span>. 
        What are the steps described here about becoming a Christian?</p>

        <p>John wrote his Gospel so that we would believe in Jesus and that by believing we may have eternal life in His name 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 20:31">John 20:31</span>). In <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:12-13">John 1:12, 13</span>, 
        this process is described in two steps. First, we receive Him, that is, believe in Him. Second, He gives us authority 
        or power to become God’s children, described in verse 13 as being begotten by God. Thus, there is a human and divine 
        aspect of becoming a Christian. We must act in belief, receive Him, and be open to the light, but He is the one who 
        regenerates the heart.</p>

        <p>In fact, faith itself is a gift of God that comes by hearing His Word 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 10:17">Rom. 10:17</span>). “In order to have true, abiding faith in Christ, 
        we must know Him as He is represented in the word.” —Ellen G. White, Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 433. 
        “The Spirit operating upon and enlightening the human mind, creates faith in God.” —Ellen G. White Comments, 
        The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 940.</p>

        <p>Those who believe or accept the Son as the Messiah receive everlasting life. John also emphasizes accepting or believing 
        the Word that Jesus spoke (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:24">John 5:24</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:38">38</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:47">47</span>). 
        It is the role of the Holy Spirit to bring conviction (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 16:7-8">John 16:7, 8</span>; 
        compare with <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 8:16">Rom. 8:16</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Romans 8:16">Romans 8:16</span>. 
        What principle about salvation in Jesus is found here?</p>

        <p>Faith, biblical faith, based on the work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, is the foundation of our faith. “Faith is . . . 
        the great blessing—the eye that sees, the ear that hears.” —Ellen G. White, In Heavenly Places, p. 104. 
        The humanistic approach to faith states that we must find a foundation, the criteria for faith, and then believe. 
        In contrast, the biblical approach states that faith is the foundation, a gift from God 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Ephesians 2:8">Eph. 2:8</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 1:17-24">1 Cor. 1:17–24</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Corinthians 2:1-6">1 Cor. 2:1–6</span>). We start with the foundation of faith, 
        and then from there we grow in understanding and grace.</p>

        <p><em>If someone were to ask you what your faith is based on, how would you respond?</em></p>

        <p>Some of the saddest accounts in all of Scripture occur in the Gospel of John. 
        “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. . . . [The Light] 
        was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. He came to 
        His own, and His own did not receive Him” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:5, 10, 11">John 1:5, 10, 11, NKJV</span>). 
        The “I AM” was rejected by many of His own people.</p>

        <p>No wonder Paul later warns, “Do not cast away your confidence” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Hebrews 10:35">Heb. 10:35, NKJV</span>). 
        As we have seen again and again, Christ was rejected because people did not accept His Word.</p>

        <p>“The contemporary humanistic way of thinking begins with doubt. People question everything in order to determine what is truth. 
        That which survives the fire of cross-examination they accept as rock-solid knowledge, something on which to place one’s faith. 
        Some apply the same method to the Bible, calling everything into question from a scientific, historical, psychological, 
        philosophical, archaeological, or geological perspective in order to determine what is truth in the Bible. The very method itself 
        starts with and builds upon doubt in the veracity of Scripture. Christ asked, ‘When the Son of Man comes, will He really find 
        faith on the earth?’ (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 18:8">Luke 18:8</span>).” —E. Edward Zinke and Roland Hegstad, 
        <em>The Certainty of the Second Coming</em> (Hagerstown, MD: Review and Herald Publishing Association, 2000), p. 96.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Numbers 13:23-33">Numbers 13:23–33</span>. What made the difference 
        between the two reports the spies brought back about Canaan?</p>

        <p>The sin of the Hebrews when they were at Kadesh Barnea was to doubt the Word of God. God had asked them to go up and take the land. 
        Twelve spies were sent to Canaan to spy out the land. They came back with two reports. The majority gave a negative report. There are 
        giants in the land, walled cities, weapons we have never seen before, and well-trained armies. By contrast, we have been slaves in the 
        land of Egypt with little military experience. Ten spies voted no, based upon the overwhelming evidence from a human standpoint. Two spies 
        voted yes based upon their faith in the overwhelming power of the Word of God.</p>

        <p><em>How do we avoid making the same kind of mistake made here? And yet, how do we also avoid presumption, doing something foolish but 
        believing that we are doing God’s will and, therefore, cannot fail?</em></p>

        <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> “Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned 
        already because [he has] not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. . . . Everyone who does evil hates the light, 
        and will not come into the light for fear that [his] deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:18-21">John 3:18–21</span>, NIV; compare with 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:10">John 1:10</span>).</p>

        <p>The rejection of Jesus Christ, the Light of the world, leaves us open to doubt and to the temptations of the devil. 
        It is to turn from light to darkness.</p>

        <p>Eve was given light on how to relate to the tree in the center of the garden. Satan tempted her to bring the light 
        into question. She tested God’s word by reasoning that a God of love would not destroy the creatures whom He created. 
        She also relied upon the data of her senses. The serpent has eaten of the fruit and now has the power to speak. 
        Perhaps the serpent is right. If I partake of the fruit, I may become like God! Deceived, she turned away from the light. 
        And her husband chose the same path.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 4:1-4">Matthew 4:1–4</span>. 
        What principles did Christ use in the wilderness of temptation to combat the deceptions of Satan?</p>

        <p>Christ had at His disposal the same humanistic tool of thought used by Adam and Eve, the antediluvians, and Israel at 
        Kadesh Barnea. He could have asked why a God of love would leave His Son in the wilderness for 40 days and nights without 
        food and protection. He also could have determined to prove His Sonship by turning stones into bread! Instead, He answered 
        with the Word of God. He operated on the level of heavenly things rather than on earthly patterns of thought. How easily 
        He could have rationalized His way to a wrong decision, which so many people, even people of faith, often do.</p>

        <p>“In stooping to take upon Himself humanity, Christ revealed a character the opposite of the character of Satan. 
        But He stepped still lower in the path of humiliation. ‘Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself,

        As the high priest laid aside his gorgeous pontifical robes, and officiated in the white linen dress of the common priest, 
        so Christ took the form of a servant, and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim.

        <p>At 8 p.m., an elderly married couple knocked on the door of the parsonage beside the Seventh-day Adventist church 
        in Savoonga, Alaska. It wasn’t late. The summer sun shone brightly in the sky. It wouldn’t go down until 2:30 a.m. 
        The Siberian Yupik people living on St. Lawrence Island, located just 36 miles east of Russia in the Bering Sea, 
        wouldn’t go to bed for hours.</p>

        <p>Eugene and Marie, who were in their mid-80s, didn’t wait for anyone to open the door. Nobody waits for the door 
        to be opened in the remote village of 835 people. Everyone knocks and walks in. The couple wanted to speak with the 
        visitor staying in the parsonage. I was visiting the island to collect stories for Adventist Mission.</p>

        <p>Marie spoke directly. “Are you a pastor?” she asked me.</p>

        <p>Her eyes filled with emotion when I shook my head. “Please stay,” she said, softly. 
        “We need someone to keep the church open and to teach us.”</p>

        <p>The church had closed several times since it and the parsonage were built in 1972. Pastors had preached and 
        lived there for a while, but then the Adventist presence shrunk to little to nothing for two decades. In 2010, 
        the church had reopened when two retired nurses from North Carolina, Bill and Elouise Hawkes, arrived as Bible 
        workers with the Alaska Conference’s Arctic Mission Adventure outreach program to Alaska Natives. Bill died in 2016, 
        and Elouise stayed. But shortly before my visit, Elouise left for health reasons.</p>

        <p>Marie missed Elouise terribly and described how she invited villagers to her home for meals and prepared food packages. 
        “We need her,” she said.</p>

        <p>I never met Elouise. She was enthusiastic and helpful as we exchanged emails for my trip. 
        My respect grew as I heard about her love for villagers.</p>

        <p>As our conversation wrapped up at 9 p.m., Marie looked at me again.</p>

        <p>“Please,” she said. “Stay. We need someone to teach us about God.”</p>

        <p>With her pleading gaze, I caught a sense of the compassion that Jesus must have felt during His earthly ministry. 
        “But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, 
        like sheep having no shepherd” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 9:36">Matthew 9:36, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>I didn’t want to leave. My heart ached for the precious people of Savoonga and the other more than 200 native 
        communities in Alaska. Only 11 of those communities have an Adventist presence.</p>

        <p>When Jesus’ heart ached, “He said to His disciples, ‘The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 
        Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest’” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 9:37-38">Matthew 9:37, 38, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>Pray for Savoonga. Pray for Alaska.</strong> Thank you for your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter 
        that will help open a center of influence to share God’s love with Alaska Natives in Bethel, Alaska.</p>

        <p>“No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, 
        He has declared Him” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:18">John 1:18, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>The Gospel of John is divided into four main sections: The Prologue (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-18">John 1:1–18</span>), 
        the Book of Signs (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:19-12:50">John 1:19–12:50</span>), the Book of Glory 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:1-20:31">John 13:1–20:31</span>), and the Epilogue 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 21:1-25">John 21:1–25</span>). Our study so far has focused mainly on the 
        Prologue and the Book of Signs, laying out who Jesus is via His miracles (signs), dialogues, and teachings. 
        The lessons now shift particularly to the third section of John, the Book of Glory.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the famous seven “I AM” statements form a bridge across the Book of Signs and the Book of Glory. 
        These are “the bread of life” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:35">John 6:35</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:41">41</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 6:48">48</span>,

        “the good shepherd” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:11">John 10:11</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 10:14">14</span>), 
        “the resurrection and the life” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 11:25">John 11:25</span>), “the way, the truth and the life” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>), and “the true vine”

        <p>This week’s lesson will begin with the purpose of the farewell discourse and its introduction with the significant episode

        <p>The farewell discourse (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13-17">John 13–17</span>) provides instruction 
        for Jesus’ disciples concerning the future. Its literary pattern is similar to Moses’ farewell in 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</span> or Jacob’s blessing his children 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Genesis 47-49">Genesis 47–49</span>) or David’s instructing Solomon 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="1 Chronicles 28-29">1 Chronicles 28, 29</span>). Jesus consoles His disciples 
        regarding His departure. He promises a surrogate to represent Him (the Holy Spirit; <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14-16">John 14–16</span>). 
        He predicts grief to come (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 15-16">John 15, 16</span>), and He exhorts the disciples 
        to stay faithful (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 15">John 15</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:1-20">John 13:1–20</span>. What happened here, 
        and why is this story so important? What lessons did Jesus seek to teach?</p>

        <p>In that part of the world in Jesus’ day, people wore sandals or went barefoot. The feet would become dusty and dirty. 
        It was a custom for a servant or slave to wash the feet of those coming to a meal. But no servant was present for this 
        function on the night Jesus ate His last meal with His disciples before His arrest.</p>

        <p>To everyone’s surprise, Jesus Himself arose from the supper and washed all of their feet. 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:4-5">John 13:4, 5</span> tells Jesus’ actions step by step. 
        It is told in such detail to emphasize the Master’s doing this unbelievable act of humility.</p>

        <p>By telling about Peter’s response, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:8-11">John 13:8–11</span> 
        deepens the sense of dismay and incomprehension of the disciples at Jesus’ actions. How could Jesus, the Master, 
        the Messiah, be doing such a lowly task? Peter refused to allow Jesus to wash his feet, only to be told by Jesus 
        that if he did not cooperate, he would have no part with Jesus. Then Peter asked for more, expressing his desire 
        to be connected with Jesus all the way.</p>

        <p>The significance of Jesus’ action is tied to who He is. He states in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:13">John 13:13</span> 
        that He is the Teacher and the Lord. That is what they called Him, and He indicates that it is so. 
        These titles express authority and power.</p>

        <p>Yet, Jesus teaches that power and authority are to be used for service, not for self-aggrandizement. 
        The Adventist Church has embraced this sense of Jesus’ example, taking what is rightly called the Ordinance of Humility 
        as a preparatory service for the Lord’s Supper.</p>

        <p><em>What does the Ordinance of Humility teach you about following in the footsteps of Jesus and how to humbly serve others?</em></p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:1-3">John 14:1–3</span>. 
        In what context did Jesus say these words?</p>

        <p>At the end of <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:33">John 13</span>, Jesus says that He is going away 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:33">John 13:33</span>). This elicits from Peter a query about 
        where He is going (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:36">John 13:36</span>). The disciples do not 
        understand that Jesus is talking about His death, resurrection, and ascension. Peter says he is ready to lay 
        down his life for Him (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:37">John 13:37</span>). This is when Jesus 
        predicts Peter’s denial (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13:38">John 13:38</span>).</p>

        <p>It is in this context that Jesus tells His disciples not to let their hearts be troubled (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:1">John 14:1</span>). 
        The verb troubled is translated in Greek as <em>tarassō</em>, which means to stir up, disturb, unsettle, throw into confusion. 
        It is not surprising that the disciples would be thrown into confusion at Jesus’ words.</p>

        <p>But, countering their fears, He talks about His Father’s house, where there are many rooms (not mansions but rooms 
        as in an inn). He is going there to prepare a place for them. His words look beyond the coming storm of the cross to 
        the time when He will return to redeem His people. He is looking to the time when this whole tragedy with sin is 
        finished once and for all (see <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Daniel 7:27">Dan. 7:27</span>).</p>

        <p>Jesus says, “ ‘If I go . . . , I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:3">John 14:3, NKJV</span>). It is clearly a promise of His second coming.</p>

        <p>What is the basis for confidence in that promise? Many would say the fulfillment of Bible prophecy, and that is 
        certainly true. But in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:3">John 14:3</span>, the basis is stated differently. 
        In this verse, <em>I will come</em> is actually in the present tense in Greek (<em>I am coming</em>). This is a use of 
        the present tense in Greek called the futuristic present. It is a future event spoken of with such certainty that 
        it is described as though already happening. Thus, it is fair to translate the phrase as, <em>I will certainly come again</em>.</p>

        <p>The basis of our hope in the return of our Lord is not simply the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. It is also, and 
        more certainly, based on our confidence in the Man who made the promise. He said He will certainly return for His people. 
        We can place our confidence in that promise because of Who made it.</p>

        <p><em>What does the Cross teach us about the certainty of Christ’s second coming? Without the Second Coming, what 
        good did Jesus’ death do us at the first coming?</em></p>

        Jesus upends the query by indicating that He Himself is the way. The way to what? The way to the Father. In the Prologue 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-18">John 1:1–18</span>), the intimate connection between the Word (logos), 
        Jesus Christ, and the Father is emphasized.</p>

        <p><span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:18">John 1:18</span> says that the only begotten (better translated here as unique) 
        God is the One who has made the Father known. To make known in this text is the Greek verb <em>exēgeomai</em>, meaning to explain, 
        interpret, exposit. We get the word exegesis from this. It means to bring out the meaning. Thus, Jesus Christ is the link 
        to the Father, the One who explains or interprets the Father to a fallen world. Consequently, He is the way or path to the Father. 
        Without Him, we are limited in our understanding.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:7-11">John 14:7–11</span>. 
        How did Jesus clear up Philip’s misunderstanding?</p>

        <p>Philip asked to see the Father, something no sinful human can do and live (compare with <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Exodus 33:17-34:9">Exod. 33:17–34:9</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:18">John 1:18</span>). Jesus reproves the lack of understanding and points out 
        that if you have seen Him, you have seen the Father (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:9">John 14:9</span>). Consequently, 
        it is clear that Jesus is the pathway to God. Without Him, the pathway grows dark and uncertain. He is the light that illuminates 
        the way to God.</p>

        <p>Jesus ties together three terms: way, truth, and life. The term way is used only in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:23">John 1:23</span> 
        regarding John the Baptist’s preparing the way for Jesus, and it is used here in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:6">John 14:6</span>. 
        But truth and life are major themes in the Gospel. Our study on Wednesday and Thursday will emphasize the concept of truth, a crucial 
        topic, especially in a world where the very idea of “truth” is called into question.</p>

        <p><em>Why is it so comforting to realize that Jesus is the best revelation we will have here of what God the Father is like?</em></p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:14">John 1:14</span>,

        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:6">14:6</span>; and <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 15:26">15:26</span>. 
        How does John tie the concept of truth directly to Jesus?</p>

        <p>Again and again in John’s Gospel, truth is connected to Jesus, to His Father, and to the Holy Spirit. 
        Truth is connected with Jesus, the Word (logos), and with light—in contrast to darkness 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-14">John 1:1–14</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 3:19-21">John 3:19–21</span>). And, too, falsehood is connected with the devil and sin 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:44-46">John 8:44–46</span>). Consequently, truth in John is not simply a matter of facts and figures. 
        It does involve such things, but more than this, the idea of truth contains a moral aspect of faithfulness to God and to His will.</p>

        <p>“There are many who are crying out for the living God, longing for the divine presence. 
        Philosophical theories or literary essays, however brilliant, cannot satisfy the heart. 
        The assertions and inventions of men are of no value. Let the word of God speak to the people. 
        Let those who have heard only traditions and human theories and maxims hear the voice of Him whose word can renew 
        the soul unto everlasting life.” —Ellen G. White, <em>Christ’s Object Lessons</em>, p. 40.</p>

        <p>Think about what it means for Jesus to be the Truth. Jesus is the logos, the Word who was with God from the beginning 
        and who was the Creator of all things created (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-4">John 1:1–4</span>). 
        One with the Father from eternity to eternity, Jesus has the characteristics of the Father, and thus is also the “I AM.” 
        His being is not subject to anyone or anything else. Nothing that exists, including knowledge, exists apart from Him. 
        And everything that does exist, that was created, was created only by Jesus and exists only in Him, as well. 
        “For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions 
        or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Colossians 1:16-17">Col. 1:16, 17, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>Jesus is not simply the embodiment of the truth; He is the Truth. Truth is not a concept or a construct. It is a Person!</p>

        <p>The Truth, Jesus Christ, can be likened to the sun that lights up the world (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 8:12">John 8:12</span>). 
        It is parallel to what C. S. Lewis stated about Christianity: “I believe in Christianity as I believe that the Sun has risen, 
        not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” —“Is Theology Poetry?” (n. p.: Samizdat University Press, 2014), 
        p. 15, originally presented in 1944.</p>

        <p>It is by Jesus, the Truth, that we are able to interpret the world around us rightly.</p>

    title: "The Scriptures and the Truth",
    lesson: "10",
    text: `
        <p>Throughout the Gospel, Scripture plays an important role in telling us about the One who is the way, the truth, 
        and the life. All through the Gospels, as all through the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, the Scriptures 
        play a key role in revealing truth. This is especially true when it comes to teaching us about who Jesus is and 
        what He came to do.</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:38-40">John 5:38–40</span>. 
        What is Jesus saying here about the Scriptures?</p>

        <p>Jesus and His disciples pointed to Scripture again and again to validate Him as the Messiah. Christ said, 
        “ ‘If you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me. But if you do not believe his writings, 
        how will you believe My words?’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 5:46-47">John 5:46, 47, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p><strong>Read:</strong> <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 24:27">Luke 24:27</span>. 
        Why is it important that Jesus first pointed to the Scriptures in order to reveal the significance of His ministry?</p>

        <p>In another place, while quoting from the book of Exodus, Christ said, “ ‘Have you not read what was spoken 
        to you by God . . . ?’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 22:31">Matthew 22:31, NKJV</span>). 
        Zacharias referred to the promises of God that “He [God] spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been 
        since the world began” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Luke 1:70">Luke 1:70, NKJV</span>). 
        In his sermon on the day of Pentecost, Peter said, “ ‘This Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit 
        spoke before by the mouth of David’ ” (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Acts 1:16">Acts 1:16, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>The Bible is not a textbook on science. It does not explain how to split the atom or perform brain surgery. 
        But it does something even more significant. It provides the context within which our universe has meaning. 
        It is the key that opens the door, the light that makes it possible to see. Without it, we would be in the dark 
        about the existence of God, His role in the universe, our own origin, the meaning of life, and the future.</p>

        <p><em>What are some truths taught in the Bible that science, even in theory, can never teach us?</em></p>

        “The Authority of the Bible and the Certainty of the Second Coming,” The Certainty of the Second Coming (Hagerstown, MD: 
        Review and Herald Publishing Association, 2000), pp. 23–36.</p>

        <p>When Jesus said, “I am the light of the world,” He “was in the court of the temple specially connected with the 
        services of the Feast of Tabernacles. In the center of this court rose two lofty standards, supporting lampstands 
        of great size. After the evening sacrifice, all the lamps were kindled, shedding their light over Jerusalem. This 
        ceremony was in commemoration of the pillar of light that guided Israel in the desert, and was also regarded as 
        pointing to the coming of the Messiah. At evening when the lamps were lighted, the court was a scene of great rejoicing. . . .</p>

        <p>“In the illumination of Jerusalem, the people expressed their hope of the Messiah’s coming to shed His light 
        upon Israel. But to Jesus the scene had a wider meaning. As the radiant lamps of the temple lighted up all about 
        them, so Christ, the source of spiritual light, illumines the darkness of the world. Yet the symbol was imperfect. 
        That great light which His own hand had set in the heavens was a truer representation of the glory of His mission.</p>

        <p>“It was morning; the sun had just risen above the Mount of Olives, and its rays fell with dazzling brightness 
        on the marble palaces, and lighted up the gold of the temple walls, when Jesus, pointing to it, said, ‘I am the 
        light of the world.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 463, 464.</p>

        <p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p>

        <p>In class, talk about your answer to Thursday’s final question. What crucial truths taught by the Bible could 
        we never, even in principle, learn from science? For example, the Cross? Or the Resurrection? Or the Second Coming? 
        What other important biblical truths must be revealed to us—otherwise, we would never know them?</p>

        <p>Think about the fall of Lucifer, a perfect being with so much intellectual knowledge of God and of what God is 
        like. And yet, even with all that, he rebelled against Him. What does this tell us about the reality of free will, 
        the same free will that we have—and why, moment by moment, we need to choose to surrender that will to God?</p>

        <p>A well-dressed woman drove her car into the parking garage of the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s Upper Magdalena Conference in Bogota, Colombia. 
        “Are you Christians?” she asked the parking attendant.</p>

        <p>“Yes,” replied 52-year-old Ruben Campos.</p>

        <p>“Which religion are you?” she asked.</p>

        <p>“We are Seventh-day Adventists,” he said. “Can we help you?”</p>

        <p>“Someone told me that Adventists don’t like to help others,” she said.</p>

        <p>Ruben was surprised. “Let us help you,” he said. “We’re ready to serve.”</p>

        <p>The woman asked if she could park her car in the church parking garage. Her apartment was nearby, but it didn’t have any parking, 
        and she didn’t feel safe leaving her car in the street at night.</p>

        <p>“Yes, you can park here,” Ruben said.</p>

        <p>“How much would it cost?” she asked.</p>

        <p>“It won’t cost you anything,” Ruben said. “It will be our gift to you.”</p>

        <p>“Thank you!” the woman exclaimed. “Can I give you a hug?”</p>

        <p>That night, the woman left her car in the parking garage. She returned the next night. On the third night, she asked Ruben for a Bible.</p>

        <p>Then the two started studying the Bible. Ruben brought her a chair, and he sat in his booth as they studied. After a month, 
        the woman said she wanted to introduce Ruben to her husband. She called from her cell phone. “It’s with him that I’m studying the Bible, 
        and I want to be baptized,” she said.</p>

        <p>The woman’s husband was a senior Colombian military officer, and he was on a temporary assignment abroad. He told Ruben that 
        he also wanted Bible studies. “We can start when I return to Colombia,” he said.</p>

        <p>Ruben may have been the happiest parking attendant in Colombia when the woman was baptized in a Seventh-day Adventist church in Bogota. 
        He is now waiting for her husband to return to the country for Bible studies.</p>

        <p>Jesus engaged in mission outreach by serving others. He said, “The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="Matthew 20:28">Matthew 20:28, NKJV</span>). Ruben is seeking to follow His example.</p>

        <p>“We can have an impact on many lives if we only serve,” said Ruben, who has worked as a parking attendant for eight years. 
        “Somebody could come to you soon. You have to be ready to serve no matter who or where that person is.”</p>

        <p>Thank you for your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering that helped two mission outreach projects in Colombia last quarter.</p>

        <p><strong>Memory Text:</strong> “ ‘The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, 
        He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you’ ” 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 14:26">John 14:26, NKJV</span>).</p>

        <p>The Gospel of John is a mosaic of themes. John calls upon signs (miracles) to show that Jesus is the Messiah 
        promised by the prophets. John uses an array of witnesses to proclaim Jesus as the Christ. He also uses the “I AM” 
        statements to point to His divinity.</p>

        <p>All three members of the Godhead are mentioned in <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-4">John 1</span> 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:1-4">John 1:1–4</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:14">14</span>, 
        <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:18">18</span>, <span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 1:32-34">32–34</span>). 
        For centuries humans have tried fully to understand the nature of the Godhead, but because we can’t, many reject the idea. 
        How foolish, though, to reject something just because we can’t fully understand it or because it doesn’t fit within the 
        narrow limits of human reasoning.</p>

        <p>John says that if you want to understand God, you must look at Jesus and what has been revealed in the Word. 
        This approach opens to us a whole new world of relationships—among the Three Members of the Godhead, 
        between the Members of the Godhead and humans, and among humans themselves. This week’s lesson looks at how the 
        Gospel of John presents the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but now within the context of the farewell discourse 
        (<span class="bible-verse" data-verse="John 13-17">John 13–17</span>).</p>
