<h2>The Gospel to All the World</h2>

<p>As we have seen, during the years of development in the church organization, the evangelization of the world has not been forgotten. In the early days, with only a handful of workers and few scattered members with very limited means, the territory of the United States alone seemed far too large to reach with the message. But God had larger plans for His people. As fast as the church could follow, He opened one door after another. By the early 1900's, all the major geographical areas of the world had been entered, and the church was fully, permanently committed to world evangelism.</p>

<p>Pioneer missionaries, entering new lands, established mission stations, and there soon followed missions or fields, then conferences and unions. As early as 1916, division organizations were formed. Since that time, there have been various restructurings of these entities as new countries emerged and new political situations made cause for changes. The following information was provided by the Youth Department of each corresponding division. As of 1999, the divisions listed were:</p>

<h2>Africa-Indian Ocean (AID)</h2>

<p>Organized in 1980, this division joins together parts of the former Trans-Africa Division, Northern Europe-West Africa Division, and the Euro-Africa Division. Its territory includes those parts of sub-Saharan west and central Africa not listed with EUD, EAD, or SAU, and the islands of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>We note here that in the very near future, all of Africa will be reorganized. We await the final decisions of the committees involved and the votes taken.</p>

<h2>Eastern Africa (EAD)</h2>

<p>Today’s Eastern Africa Division has arrived at its present status among the highest-membership divisions via often-complicated arrangements of structural management created by the constantly changing political situations. While the environment for managing and effectively coordinating the work has not been the most desired, God has still in His providence guided in the constant spreading of the gospel, regardless of political, racial, and tribal turmoil.</p>

<p>The <em>1921 Yearbook</em> states that the “African Division” was “constituted by action at the Boulder [Colorado] Council, October 1919, not fully organized.” W. H. Branson was named president. There were only 2,200 members spread out through three unions of southern and eastern Africa. A later change caused the area to be called the Southern Africa Division, and Elder Robert H. Pierson was elected as president. This entity now included a wider range of east and central African countries and moved its headquarters from Cape Province, South Africa, to Harare (Salisbury), Zimbabwe (Rhodesia).</p>

<p>In 1968 a Trans-Africa Division was formed, which included the East African Union, to begin with, but then by 1970 the East African Union became part of the Afro-Mideast Division. In 1983 there were two divisions: the Trans-Africa and the Eastern Africa. The territory of the EAD now covered Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Djibouti, and Ethiopia. It was based in Nairobi, Kenya, and had as its president the first black African, Elder Bekele Heye. The Trans-Africa Division included South Africa, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and Botswana, with headquarters still in Harare. Elder Kenneth Mittleider was president.</p>

<p>1983 was a pivotal point in all this. Both divisions were merged, forming a new Eastern Africa Division with headquarters in Harare. Included within its territory are Botswana, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The southern Africa nations became an independent union attached to the General Conference.</p>

<h2>Euro-Africa (EUD)</h2>

<p>The two divisions that cover Europe still reflect some of the turmoil of the past caused by the political upheavals of two world wars. As the “pie” now looks, this division includes Southern Europe, North Africa, some countries bordering the Black Sea, Afghanistan, Angola, Iran, and Mozambique– a total of thirty-one very diverse political entities. Some of the greatest challenges for Global Mission are found within the territories of this division, and at the same time some of the greatest breakthroughs are here, as well.</p>

<p>One such case is the manner in which the church in Romania has exploded in recent years since the fall of Communism. Membership jumped from a small handful to nearly 72,000; Pathfinders went from zero to more than 5,000 in just over two years, and projections were to double the number by the turn of the millennium two years later.</p>

<h2>Euro-Asia (ESD)</h2>

<p>With the change of political winds in the 1980's came an opportunity to finally organize the work in the various countries of the former Soviet Union (excepting the Baltic republics). The division was organized in 1990 with about 37,000 members in 550 churches. Within only eight years, the division had grown to 130,000 members in 1500 churches. This division now is organized into five unions, twenty-five conferences, and two attached fields; its headquarters are in Moscow.</p>

<p>Through God’s guidance and protection displayed by a series of miracles, the Zaokski Theological Seminary was established in 1988; a publishing house– <em>Source of Life</em>– was founded; the Adventist Health Center was established, and the Voice of Hope Media Center began broadcasting.</p>

<h2>Inter-American (IAD)</h2>

<p>The largest division for over 20 years and baptizing new members at an average of over 400 per day gives a short view of how quickly the work is growing in this region “between the Americas.” The division comprises North America from Mexico to Panama, the South American countries of Colombia, Venezuela, and the three “Guianas,” and the Caribbean islands. It is the only division with its headquarters outside of the division territory (Miami, Florida). International transportation quirks and costs make it the most practical location.</p>

<p>Four major languages are spoken: Spanish, English, French, and Dutch. In spite of some high population densities, the ratio for its membership is lowest of all divisions at 1:13. It is said that if all the churches in the three conferences on the island of Jamaica were built in a row, there would be one every ¼ mile (0.44 Km). In the island nation of Antigua-Barbuda, over 1% of the island population is a Pathfinder.</p>

<h2>North American (NAD)</h2>

<p>The territory of the North American Division includes Bermuda, Canada, the French possession of St. Pierre and Miquelon, the United States of America, Johnson Island, Midway Islands and all other islands of the Pacific not attached to other divisions, and is bounded by the dateline on the west, by the equator on the south and by longitude 120 on the east. This division, with 4,718 churches, 368 companies and 879,829 members, is divided into nine unions (1997 data). In 1997 the total population in this territory was 297,609,586.</p>

<p>The North American Division is blessed to have the World Headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church situated within its borders in Silver Spring, Maryland. It still maintains the special arrangement with the General Conference that it had before becoming a full-fledged division. The NAD has a president, secretary, treasurer, three vice-presidents, and department directors who oversee the work of the division. The three top officers also serve as associates in the General Conference. No other division has this arrangement.</p>

<p>There are six universities, nine (tertiary level) colleges, and 1,044 primary and secondary schools operated in the North American Division. There are more than one hundred hospitals, nursing homes, and retirement centers. Two large publishing houses, the Pacific Press and the Review and Herald, serve both the North American Division and the world field.</p>

<p>Many institutions in the North American Division help to make it a training and supply center for the world. In 1997 there were 619 NAD employees working as interdivision employees (formerly called missionaries) serving in overseas divisions. Of these 619, there were 142 serving in the medical work. This division had more interdivision employees serving in other countries than all the other divisions combined. Also in 1997 there were 289 Adventist Volunteers serving in other countries. There were 83 young Task Force volunteers serving within the North American Division.</p>

<h2>Northern Asia-Pacific (NSD)</h2>

<p><strong>The former Far Eastern Division</strong>, which was organized in 1919 and renamed Asia-Pacific Division in 1995, comprised the following unions: Bangladesh, Korea, Japan, South China Island, Myanmar, East Indonesia, West Indonesia, North Philippine, Central Philippine, South Philippine, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka Union of Churches, and the attached field of Guam-Micronesia.</p>

<p>In 1997, this vast expanse was divided between the north and the south. The northern region became the new NSD and includes the following territories: The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Japan, Macau, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and has added to it the countries of Mongolia and the People’s Republic of China. This new division, with a population of 1.5 billion, is the largest concentration of people of any division of the world field.</p>

<p>There are 421,000 members and 1,450 churches as of 1998, comprising the Japan and Korean Union Conferences, the South China Island Union Mission, and the East Asia Association.</p>

<p>The Northern Asia-Pacific Division operates the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One university</li>
    <li>Four colleges</li>
    <li>37 secondary schools</li>
    <li>Four food industries</li>
    <li>Eight hospitals</li>
    <li>One health center</li>
    <li>Three nursing homes/retirement centers</li>
    <li>Three publishing houses</li>
    <li>Four Bible correspondence schools</li>
    <li>38 English language schools</li>

<h2>South American (SAD)</h2>

<p>The South American Division was organized in 1916 and has its division offices in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. This division now has nine unions: Austral, Bolivian, Central Brazil, Chilean, East Brazil, North Brazil, Northeast Brazil, Peruvian, and South Brazil. It also has two attached fields in Ecuador that may soon become the tenth union.</p>

<p>The 2000 statistics showed 6,387 churches accommodating 1,701,600 members. This division has many schools, hospitals, clinics, and other related institutions. It also has a very active program with medical launches, airplanes, and rolling clinics. There are a number of orphanages, elderly-care facilities, and two publishing houses.</p>

<p>The South American Division is considered the first-ranking division in its educational work and literature evangelism. The division also has four universities among its institutions of higher learning, which are all recognized by their respective governments and are ranked among the best in their countries. A fifth university in Brazil is now even operating on two fully-equipped campuses with maximum enrollments.</p>

<p>In Brazil, at the time of this edition of this manual, a new school was being opened on the average of every five weeks. Brazil and the Philippines (SSD) were in a “friendly race” toward becoming the first million-member country. Brazil was the first to report having attained that goal at the 2000 G.C. session in Toronto, Canada.</p>

<h2>South Pacific (SPD)</h2>

<p>Statistics don’t tell the whole story of any division. The SPD is certainly one that would need more than a few paragraphs to illustrate even the basics. Within its five unions are more than 304,000 members scattered across a continent and nearly unnumbered islands of the blue Pacific. Some of these islands have the highest membership/population ratios in the world. As a whole, the Western Pacific Union has a ratio of 1:22.5; within it, however, is the West Solomon Islands Mission with a ratio of 1:6 in 79 churches.</p>

<p>As has been mentioned in previous sections of this manual, the work began early in this part of the world; it was early reinforced by a strong educational program and backed financially by a large food industry. While there were setbacks during World War II, the work never slowed down much, especially in the island nations. Today the biggest challenge facing the division is the secularization of Australia, which has always served as the operating and financial base.</p>

<h2>Southern Asia (SUD)</h2>

<p>The Southern Asia Division today is exclusively the countries of India and Nepal. Though it lost the Unions of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma (Myanmar), Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka to other divisions in 1986, it has been able to more than double its membership of 134,000 at that time to its present membership (2000) of over 350,000 worshiping in more than 1,000 churches. Additionally, the church has a significant presence in the form of auxiliary institutions, with 294 schools, 4 colleges, 12 hospitals and clinics, a publishing house, and two orphanages. The division offices are now located at Hosur, Tamil Nadu, having moved from Poona in 1989. Poona, however, is still a major center for the church with the presence of Spicer Memorial College, Oriental Watchman Publishing House, Adventist Media Center, a hospital, four schools, and the Central India Union headquarters.</p>

<p>There are now six unions in the division, which illustrates the rapid growth over the past few years. The first conference was organized in 1993; since then, four more sections (fields) have been moved up the scale to conference level as well. In India alone, there are now about one billion people, with 84% Hindus, 11% Muslims, and 3.5% other religions. Christians form a small minority of 2.4% of the total population. In spite of this, the work of the gospel is being aggressively pushed forward, with plans to construct a thousand new churches during the three-year period surrounding the turn of the millennium.</p>

<p>The following is a brief synopsis of the beginnings of the work in India: William Lenker and A. T. Stroup, two literature evangelists, were the first to bring the message to India back in 1893. Two years later, the first full-time missionary—a lady by the name of Georgia Burrus—arrived. Only 24 years later, the Southern Asia Division was created (1919). A school was founded in Coimbatore in 1915 by G. G. Lowry, which grew and was eventually moved to Poona, becoming then the now-famous Spicer Memorial College. Publishing work began in 1896, and today the publishing house produces material in 14 of India’s languages. Radio broadcasts from the media center are now programming ten languages.</p>

<h2>Southern Asia-Pacific (SSD)</h2>

<p>The other half of the former Far Eastern Division, the SSD spreads over seven time zones, seventeen political entities and twenty-one thousand islands. Indonesia alone has over 13,000 islands, with more than 6,000 of them inhabited. “The gospel to all the world” is a particularly interesting challenge to the one million members as they seek ways of reaching the 655+ million total population of these countries.</p>

<h2>Trans-European (TED)</h2>

<p>This division comprises an arch over northern Europe from the British Isles, Holland and Scandinavia to the Baltics and Poland; then the Balkans and Greece; from Egypt and Sudan through the Middle East; and Pakistan, for a total of 41 political entities with some challenges equal to those faced by EUD.</p>

<h2>Southern Africa Union (SAU)</h2>

<p>During its history, this territory has been a part of several different entities (see East African Division for some of this information). At the time of publication of this manual, this union has been considered an attached Union to the General Conference. The decade of the nineties saw a major change take place within the political and church spheres of influence. These resulted in mergers of church structures and several very positive steps forward in the work of the church. The compilers of this information feel quite certain that the information here presented will be outdated in the near future as further restructuring continues on the paths of progress.</p>

<p>Currently (1999), the union comprises the countries of Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, the Republic of South Africa, and three South Atlantic island entities. Educational institutions include two colleges and five secondary schools, two hospitals, one publishing house, and numerous other institutions. The membership has surpassed the 71,000 mark.</p>
