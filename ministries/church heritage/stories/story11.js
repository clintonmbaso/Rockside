<h2>A Changing World</h2>

<p>Both the world and the church emerged from World War II profoundly changed. National boundaries were redrawn, political landscapes shifted, and societies evolved. These transformations required adjustments in administrative structures and church divisions to better address the new realities.</p>

<p>In some countries, satisfactory and comprehensive reporting became impossible. Travel also became more complicated with the introduction of entry and exit visas, adding further challenges to missionary work and global church operations.</p>
